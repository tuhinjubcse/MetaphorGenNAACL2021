Best of painters ! <V> do <V> portray
Where lie <V> am <V>
When howe was retreating , he <V> expected <V> him pursue ;
Those <V> living <V> woods , that shine with bloom ,
The world escaping ? magnus ' fortunes <V> uncertain <V> ,
Sweet is the page that <V> listen <V> there ,
Down <V> became <V> a bishop , sirs , and up
In this sudden terror <V> is <V>
Tho ' never mirth <V> no <V> a strain
If ever more should <V> seem <V> those mutual eyes ,
The which i mai noght yit <V> be <V> .
While sleep <V> appeared <V> man and beast to her .
Since from blood <V> stained <V> out rise only ghosts again ,
Nor <V> allowed <V> them up to pray .
Had <V> had <V> me wholly , to its burning top .
Tortured her love not to <V> act <V> the law .
White wings <V> bordered <V> on the white .
So that a discord <V> becomes <V> among things
Back they flew , and <V> ate <V> their nest .
With nothing but blank sky and wounds that <V> intensified <V> ,
And feebly <V> accepted <V> in his son 's warm gore .
Must <V> hear <V> a soul that ached for her
Aye , we will <V> know <V> the flag
Thereat the warrior <V> wanted <V> , and strange it seemed
He <V> wanted <V> to the twelve ; for at his head
A few brief questions ; and the answers <V> provided <V>
On our threshold a welcome still <V> exists <V> .
But <V> knew <V> several figures in its cost ;
Where clover-blossoms <V> enhanced <V> their fragrance wide
All space would ring and <V> rap <V> with my rhyme .
Which , hearing rescued israel , <V> erected <V> erect ,
When mary stay 'd beneath . but not to <V> notice <V>
Bluster or cringe , and <V> become <V> life
And share what <V> seemed <V> of beds and crumbs ,
By medicine well <V> intended <V> , but without grace
And nails as keys <V> are <V> thee everywhere .
To marriage state he <V> begun <V> his thoughts anew ,
And in her old bounds <V> ended <V> her despair ,
By it your fathers <V> remember <V> unmoved and true ,
Of tissue <V> hanging <V> around him , shutting out
Though from it inspiration <V> seems <V> .
And the structure , as it <V> ended <V> ,
If prudent , age should <V> seem <V> the friendly foe ,
So she <V> continued <V> it to boil ,
Love still shall <V> h <V> around its brim .
Because i <V> write <V> an impious gift to thee --
" a weeping country <V> seems <V> a widow 's tear ;
For to church it never <V> sold <V> .
But <V> have <V> much lasting bloom .
And chanting <V> named <V> the wood-nymph ,
Your judgment <V> constitutes <V> a guilty poem , there
Still with his soul severe account he <V> knows <V> ,
Which since runs <V> cloth <V> as doth thy blood ;
The need that men <V> need <V> to create and believe ,
Yet i bear a heart shall <V> answer <V> me still .
He <V> does <V> address to her , and she
When the gloaming <V> became <V> that night ,
And fortune , has an awkward part to <V> complete <V> ;
Subdued her strength nor <V> hesitated <V> at her charms --
The coward slave who <V> crawl <V> aside ;
And <V> understood <V> the eternal meanings .
We will <V> receive <V> the cannon back
On the crops the white-frost <V> started <V> ,
Or souls that their eternal rest do <V> hear <V> ,
The tawny covering from the dark wolf <V> gone <V> ;
The winds <V> seem <V> warm as araby :
Appointed at <V> selected <V> times his solemn feasts ,
Her ambushed violets <V> were <V> .
How the winters are <V> being <V> like flakes of snow !
Like a grimme lyon <V> trained <V> with fierce might
Well <V> enjoy <V> the dances
Sinner and saint it <V> inspired <V> them all ,
I seemed to <V> am <V> among a world of ghosts ;
And with frost was quite <V> done <V> ,
The wind that <V> is <V> from the frozen hill .
Sad <V> said <V> aeneas , pitying their estate ,
And watch the sun <V> start <V> down behind the trees ,
But that a pure and christian faith <V> seems <V> warm ,
Rags ! and our only requiem <V> are <V> ,
What verse can <V> learn <V> , what prose narrate ,
Perpetual , which nor autumn <V> seems <V> dispers 'd
Or by fate 's malice to destruction <V> occurred <V> ,
" let galileo <V> want <V> his own opinions .
Her strong hand <V> is <V> on her blunted sword ,
Soon <V> been <V> the sea-mist ,
And <V> be <V> in love , and friendship 's smile
Could <V> seem <V> no answer to her glorious eyes :
That door could <V> happen <V> to hell ?
These cares alone her virgin breast <V> preserved <V> ,
So there the thing <V> seemed <V> . "
He <V> desired <V> demand ; and in the stranger knew
The tryst is <V> beginning <V> for me ,
My bones at quiet may go <V> forget <V> their rest ;
Were blameless , or <V> cared <V> . for innocence
At his touch he <V> expected <V> new courage
Now <V> dread <V> all the power of stifled birth
That heals and <V> is <V> .
Yes , go and <V> know <V> comfort to thy friends ,
By vain prosperity <V> enabled <V> ,
Death is <V> walking <V> at the door .
In forfeit kisses <V> varying <V> from lip to lip .
" let power <V> be <V> as sentry on every hand ,
And every joy he <V> is <V> me comes
Constantia <V> expected <V> a serious fit --
The proclamation <V> began <V> for may :
By contrast <V> was <V> it bright :
What needs he the defence this arm can <V> tolerate <V> ?
For while her limbs were <V> closed <V> in deadly sleep
A master <V> qualified <V> in mastership ,
The hosts <V> chose <V> way for passage of the king ,
But beauty 's only <V> wanted <V> for love .
Would <V> think <V> like resurrection on the mind ,
They also <V> known <V> of misadventure sad
Of elm trees , newly <V> rooted <V> into bud ,
The fibre <V> begins <V> , and through the vital parts
Of rome , enslaved , is <V> transformed <V> into life ;
The attending heralds , as by office <V> required <V> ,
To <V> enjoy <V> the hunt until the quarry 's won .
Thus <V> do <V> they congee , and the angry knight
So few are now the feet that <V> look <V> ;
Here they <V> thought <V> , had realms and lands ,
To <V> wish <V> a bloom up to the sun
The appetite <V> is <V> , that this is ask 'd ,
Nor the bird of air did <V> need <V> him .
My soul <V> becomes <V> clad in gorgeous things ,
When him a melancholy voice <V> seemed <V> ;
That manhood 's powers <V> know <V> ,
And clouds are <V> watching <V> , and banks stretch wide ,
Of lively portraiture <V> involved <V> ,
What do i <V> want <V> that am myself undone ?
<V> go <V> on from bad to worse ,
<V> is <V> o'er the cloud of saxon war ,
Their music never <V> seemed <V> .
Till it <V> are <V> the top of heaven ,
Whom nature hath <V> looked <V> apt for every change !
And hands to <V> listen <V> his hands rejoice ,
What horror was <V> done <V> in that small hot bird .
With asses all his time he <V> thought <V> ,
" and then the doom foreseen upon me <V> ended <V> ,
“ dismiss , <V> try <V> thine idle fear ,
Two strangers haste to <V> start <V> his train .
That jupiter supreme still <V> adorned <V> the throne .
<V> see <V> on the paladins and ladies all .
Thy world and mine , the eternal victory <V> exists <V> !
To pass delay not , <V> spoken <V> by blows behind ;
Nor with the scoffers <V> talking <V> :
How supplejoints a lesson <V> begins <V>
And , better far , a heart that <V> looked <V>
That <V> became <V> him careless ' mid his dead ,
In stars , she <V> voice <V> to america , the land
And gild our chamber ceilings as they <V> seemed <V> ,
In that lake of tears which my grief <V> was <V> ,
This he had <V> needed <V> above all others dear ;
“ while on her hearth <V> be <V> blazing many a piece
Within the gates his way he <V> wanted <V> ;
And weariness was <V> substituted <V> with delight ,
And been by gryphon foully <V> started <V> to scorn ;
And its perplexed paths no more can <V> know <V> ;
Great merion follows , and new shouts <V> sounded <V> :
<V> tell <V> some separate truth that we may know .
For { books <V> write <V> to husbands and to brothers .
But this <V> became <V> from the bless 'd abodes ,
The curtain <V> ended <V> o ' nature 's rest ,
And <V> know <V> the harmless folly of the time !
Who <V> knew <V> i ween two hundred years ,
- the few steps <V> seemed <V> at a funeral pace
I <V> like <V> to thee the mode of dying , "
Doth human worth <V> know <V> up ; and so ordains
Which , whirling round , <V> continued <V> on so rapidly ,
To him i <V> believed <V> my fear ,
Princess , <V> ring <V> ear to this my summary ;
My youth and joy <V> continue <V> .
Who <V> dared <V> through cowardice the great refusal .
Gold bands his raised hoof <V> says <V> ,
Till each rivet <V> needs <V> the strain ,
Shouldst not <V> heal <V> my veins asunder . "
Lock 'd rotting rooms her eyes must never <V> speak <V> ,
But human nature <V> provided <V> .
But how <V> knew <V> the meaning of the signs ?
To adam what shall <V> happened <V> in future dayes ,
But all abstracts of rarities are <V> used <V> ,
And <V> sent <V> the harpies from their native reign ?
On the morrow <V> decided <V> to challenge ; in their strength
The finest organ , and <V> known <V> by mind .
And my poor words are <V> heard <V> amid that throng ,
Of his ally <V> seemed <V> vengeance , destroying perchance
And the rifles <V> sounded <V> their hate ,
Host against host with shadowy squadrons <V> approaching <V> ,
And within it <V> looked <V> a people
And cold the wind that <V> tide <V> round
That <V> is <V> me alone in the strife ,
Latona <V> provided <V> thy life to thee ,
" <V> trying <V> out the thousand wars of old ,
Shall <V> know <V> the snaws of age ;
And it <V> became <V> the sleet and the snow .
<V> leading <V> on , cried sanctimonius ,
But still one task <V> needed <V> to do ;
She never <V> cared <V> . no word , no motion ,
And <V> provided <V> them to his warrior train in charge .
The chanting pythoness <V> inspired <V> oracle ,
" i should curse the hour that <V> affected <V> me ,
There 's never a scot shall <V> permit <V> ye free :
In other days ere joy had <V> awakened <V> this brow ;
We <V> speak <V> the name that marks our race ;
Whether need of gold should <V> super <V> thee ,
Where liberty shall firmly <V> originate <V> ,
A bird of prey , with talons <V> mocking <V> ,
We scarce could do better than <V> achieve <V> an alliance ,
One <V> named <V> the mango garden low ,
And though her tresses <V> looked <V> but in such guise
To <V> cry <V> their tears around his tomb .
His will <V> was <V> control ; and long fettered desire
In streets where <V> existed <V> their rosy stalls ,
And all his vengeance <V> happened <V> .
The bugle 's <V> used <V> for smoke and play ;
Hence <V> being <V> the indian-summer bloom
And to suggest one counsel they <V> believed <V> .
The first <V> seems <V> : " i have found a king
To <V> hear <V> that mortgage , to pay that debt .
Which <V> know <V> the holiest from the people 's eyes
It <V> is <V> to me and a man i know ,
But naught of our flag can <V> believe <V> .
To watch the clouds go <V> passing <V> by ?
Lest , thus <V> lived <V> with funereal gloom ,
Whilst on each face the embers <V> open <V> ,
<V> take <V> care that in our members life remains .
Which by kind sorrow 's ministry hath <V> known <V>
To whom dominion o'er the rest <V> seems <V> .
There <V> be <V> his veilèd destiny ;
Nor , till the sun had <V> seemed <V> to bed ,
And those mute lips to smiles had <V> become <V> ;
They <V> like <V> the old echoes calling :
The marsh-grass <V> fled <V> with the flowers ,
On the sleeper 's ear those rich notes <V> sound <V> ,
Sapped by corruption to itself <V> is <V> .
Through the thought still <V> being <V> beyond her :
Shall <V> said <V> one word , to tell
In public loss to <V> be <V> a tear ,
Mercy soon <V> praised <V> her to praise above .
I see my coming has but mischief <V> proved <V> .
And whoever it <V> i <V> 'd was made clean !
And conscience , truth , and honesty are <V> known <V>
Of weary fibres <V> moist <V> with toil ,
Should be <V> seemed <V> better for the life of man --
And with his words new rapture <V> starts <V> :
They <V> reminded <V> us battle , through our leader 's fault
Content , thine equal , <V> love <V> in faithful peace ,
I <V> liked <V> no fear ; the one who waited there
Many dreary days have <V> happened <V> ,
Nor envy <V> is <V> a place .
The old man , <V> shaken <V> and propless quite .
Screeched out a song , to <V> enjoy <V> my grief ;
And there the body <V> is <V> , age after age .
That i shall <V> beg <V> no mournful cry :
A king might wish to <V> do <V> in fee .
With truth i answer ; thou the truth <V> was <V> .
Was strengthened in the hate she <V> hate <V> before .
Approaching fights , and fields to <V> see <V> in blood .
But nature <V> create <V> it imperfect ever ,
Such order <V> seemed <V> huge ajax ; purple gore
Before the last <V> fell <V> , heavy with dew ,
" unhappy guest ! whose sorrows <V> disturbed <V> my mind !
Who <V> provide <V> fresh beauty to the morning light ,
With the cud that <V> shaped <V> it swell .
Up the street <V> sounded <V> the rebel tread ,
As golden balls with laughter lightly <V> twitch <V> ,
While my life and taste <V> happened <V> ,
And heard the <V> parting <V> waves of the harbor moan .
To <V> think <V> the scene more fair ;
Your friend is dead , " i <V> smiled <V> .
( a gray east , <V> ing <V> with rosy day )
Hast rendered me security , and <V> ordered <V> me
And summer <V> begun <V> wi ' joy ,
A wife <V> seems <V> or takes love in upright earnest .
To <V> guts <V> the sob of my agony .
Does it <V> seem <V> that i love again ?
A <V> recurring <V> dream of dread , upon the deep ;
The devil <V> resembles <V> sweet shapes when he tells lies .
And the drums <V> seems <V> more convulsive ,
Oh , <V> buy <V> me death or liberty !
The nymph <V> created <V> breath to shake and thrill ;
" it will not <V> best <V> for nought . "
The feather 'd arrow <V> looked <V> a dire portent ,
I laughed to <V> explain <V> them aching ,
Might <V> let <V> musaeus from his bower ,
To <V> learn <V> its genius , and direct its rage .
But we have <V> accepted <V> those gentle haunts to pass
The warly race may riches <V> are <V> ,
<V> follow <V> thy footsteps to the realms below --
With years and spheres that <V> ended <V> ,
With boughs that <V> crowds <V> at every breath ,
Then shall the church in rapturous numbers <V> happen <V> ,
The western republic will <V> host <V> it through -- :
The father , so far <V> knowing <V> as to humor
But little time had <V> permitted <V> her drooping head ,
Victorious he his mighty triumph <V> won <V> ,
She <V> seemed <V> reluctant to the deep , such dread
With pity <V> asked <V> , exhorted mercury
Thy tears and all thy songs to <V> sing <V> .
With thee , and then it <V> am <V> alert ,
A glory i shall not <V> mind <V> .
What sleight had she the wardens to <V> justify <V> ?
With transports <V> killed <V> upon pain ,
Save of blown self-applause , they proudly <V> smiled <V>
And <V> have <V> that bright revealment known
<V> be <V> upon my lowly grave ,
From out the ashes <V> seemed <V> .
A death he once had <V> lived <V> most fair ;
Wee must that discord surely <V> know <V> ,
In life ’s best joys my share have <V> lived <V> ;
Big ships with sails <V> parted <V> to the breeze ;
Two chiefs from each <V> moved <V> breathless to the plain .
Or generous draft , <V> say <V> as a gift ,
Are <V> smelling <V> like sweet maidens when they dream .
And curled like serpents which <V> end <V> .
And the more ample years <V> ¨ <V>
Made filthy mixture , with steps <V> seemed <V> slow ;
Is there no term of suffering <V> expected <V> before thee ?
The sun had <V> darkened <V> the crab at morn
And <V> pulled <V> on his beard so gray .
From his pure fountains <V> started <V> two streams likewise ,
When overcome 't is <V> surrounded <V> by the sea .
May <V> be <V> some witness to my virtuous spring ,
And meekly <V> wrote <V> what fortune sent :
Where dionean caesar 's star <V> grew <V> forth
A flare <V> starts <V> up ; the shining whiteness spread
Before me <V> walked <V> his spectral stand ,
And <V> is <V> voice to tears ,
The fruits are <V> chosen <V> in eternity ,
Strong in a fate <V> became <V> free ,
Where not to vile fanatic passion <V> are <V> ,
Whose snorting nostrils <V> enjoyed <V> the flames of fire .
Thy war ( discreetly <V> written <V> ) with white success .
What could he see but mightily he <V> knew <V> ?
With courage <V> fulfilled <V> the sacrifice .
Nor <V> asked <V> of grace from fair ladye . "
Death and anguish <V> died <V> ? " he cries , --
Wide the new world had <V> become <V> its bright gates .
Her white feet <V> looked <V> glimmering
And life 's fine loyalties are <V> forgotten <V> to jest ,
Thus the golden moon <V> becomes <V> answer :
The parakeets <V> start <V> screaming by
My apprehensions <V> seemed <V> in crowds ;
And all the trembling flowers they <V> loved <V> .
Her forming hand <V> becomes <V> shape unto the name .
Death will quickly <V> laugh <V> upon me ,
With brimming glass that <V> poured <V> the toast ,
While ilion like a mist <V> was <V> into towers .
For their amusements never <V> par <V> ,
His wheels settles -- what shall men <V> speak <V> then ?
One lonely day — another <V> ending <V> in sadness ;
No music that the robin <V> does <V>
Now <V> worship <V> with incense from diana 's shrine ,
With music <V> provided <V> of distraction his heart enlarged .
Our perfect union would be <V> becoming <V> complete :
<V> turning <V> moons and planets to their constant road
Are <V> hearts <V> the hearts of all the ranging seas --
To <V> provide <V> a sovereign and relieve a sire :
Few steps we <V> said <V> until we there had come ,
He <V> was <V> his soul from sin 's dark trace ,
That the long years <V> seemed <V> in the outs and ins
" whilst thou slept , i <V> desired <V> to musing
Who <V> respected <V> through the centuries his race .
Yet faithful to its trust <V> granted <V> .
<V> say <V> out their futile tune ,
From my weak heart the <V> waiting <V> emptiness .
And whispering fear has <V> seemed <V> instead .
And his health <V> is <V> briskly all day round .
Where the dusky warp we <V> listen <V> , --
The little gate was <V> answered <V> at last ,
Britain , aspiring briton , now must <V> eat <V> --
How <V> am <V> that lovely casket here to me ?
That <V> enables <V> and re-delivers every stroke
And i ne'er knew what music <V> seems <V> ,
Fame starts <V> talking <V> at such prizes won ,
Of the <V> am <V> courts of law ;
So rollant <V> knows <V> his sword was taken forth ,
Wherein a firebrand <V> caused <V> a dreadful light ,
She shall <V> write <V> upon your errands ,
And <V> continues <V> to fancy all her youthful mind .
Soft on thee <V> become <V> the breath of time ,
To <V> like <V> them look so gay ?
And <V> knew <V> the seasons chase ,
Are rare . with this distinction <V> understand <V> my words ;
Spoke aloud the words which <V> understand <V> :
The dear , brown eyes their answer <V> be <V> ;
Gives hope and fervor , nearer <V> knowing <V> his theme
The essence that alone <V> caused <V> love divine --
My most true mind thus <V> prove <V> mine untrue .
And <V> knew <V> such piercing pain they ca n't hold out
Trembling for ire , and <V> look <V> pale for rage ,
Thus , while in equal scales their fortune <V> happened <V>
Through the vast assembly <V> assembled <V> .
But virtue hath <V> become <V> 'd all change to grace :
Light have ye still to <V> think <V> evil or good ,
May <V> was <V> as dear a nurse at need ,
He crushed remorse and <V> said <V> down despair :
She <V> shouted <V> surrender to abducting arms .
Eurytion to his brother <V> singing <V> a prayer ,
Hard battle for us , <V> ﬁ <V> with arms
Their superstitions <V> imagined <V> them ready prey ;
More black than bright , <V> blind <V> death
I <V> imagined <V> myself a ghost , and seemed to be
Thy ray could <V> anti <V> , and answer have .
With the blight of death it <V> finished <V> ?
By whose <V> beloved <V> craft his mother died :
Since sorrows <V> ended <V> ;
The torrent 's thunder <V> sounded <V> into a sigh ;
We <V> were <V> the grass on that youngling spring ;
For , is this emmy that i <V> wish <V> ?
<V> is <V> such a voluble answer promising all ,
Of matter , from their old arrangements <V> were <V>
Never was blast from vapour <V> treated <V> with cold ,
Who <V> deserved <V> right , and kept his people free ;
Nor <V> forget <V> the argive story of ilium ,
On duties well performed , and days well <V> learned <V> !
But here is nought with grief to <V> said <V> .
His great mare <V> liked <V> the hoof-casts fly .
Through all my pulses <V> began <V> ;
Opinions ? they still <V> spoke <V> a wider range :
Not worlds could <V> deny <V> her from his arms away ,
Thieves <V> happen <V> upon them furiously ,
Where bargains <V> seemed <V> for purses spare ,
Where genius all his light <V> continues <V> --
Must <V> provide <V> the north and south in every good ,
When trembling night-winds <V> know <V>
That by their own gay light were <V> speaking <V> up .
In the holy temple <V> fulfilled <V> her amends ,
What stealthy footstep <V> is <V> her ?
Who <V> understands <V> with fear the rending earth survey
Earthquake hath <V> continued <V> deeply its tale on them --
But i jumped to <V> thinking <V> how sharp had been
Who <V> was <V> o'er all my faculties control
He lay before the <V> growing <V> sun ,
The number <V> caused <V> the motion slower .
How have the raptur 'd moments <V> lasted <V> !
The talk about the wondrous circus <V> existed <V> .
And truth <V> accepted <V> , and righted wrong ,
While joy <V> becomes <V> clouds the light of stars ,
With wicker arks did <V> o <V>
And <V> is <V> in my footsteps , hail new worlds ,
And wondered when i <V> knew <V> reply ,
So the figures of this song <V> started <V> --
I <V> ain <V> twenty years , ochone !
Who ever <V> desired <V> his loved ones ’ bliss .
The cold dust shall inform , and <V> let <V>
Friends , who <V> stepped <V> forth at our side ,
To joy and ease their days they <V> thought <V> ,
The kite <V> walked <V> up . his honest heart
We loaf where the wind-spilled fountain <V> seems <V> .
The brightest truths that man has ever <V> thought <V> .
A spell which thou , hast <V> believed <V> ,
<V> forced <V> into virtue thus by self-defence ,
<V> gives <V> us a sense of the awe ,
Had leaned , and <V> was <V> a soft impress .
Rich in each charm that <V> seemed <V> desire ,
No wing material <V> represents <V> our mortal clay .
And her eyes <V> looked <V> with tears ;
Through greedy eyes to <V> become <V> the soul withal ,
<V> think <V> the sacred lodge with terror ,
And the rough hazels <V> walking <V> along the beach .
Back through the streets that <V> seemed <V> at your tread --
The fruitful bough they <V> thought <V> .
<V> is <V> ' neath your careless tread .
The warrior 's gyves no sooner they <V> mad <V> ,
It clasped her neck and <V> became <V> asleep .
The message <V> displayed <V> was for the king design 'd .
A rose whose crimson breath <V> seemed <V>
As hope was <V> spoken <V> in his breast :
Like the great sun who <V> favored <V> the skies ,
How the allotted income <V> depended <V> ,
<V> sounds <V> simpler than the reckoning of their shilling .
Here <V> seem <V> the chronicles that told
An angel <V> seems <V> from every cloud that rolls ;
Mind remained silent . i <V> hesitate <V> for an answer .
That <V> looked <V> his royal standard laid on ground ,
And the moon never stares but it <V> laughs <V> me nightmares
That better time , for which the patriots <V> awake <V> ,
And brilliant treasure it may <V> seem <V> .
And in thy joyous errand <V> received <V> the spot
A hermit ’s home should ever <V> i <V> .
Honour , be sure , and duty strongly <V> listen <V> :
Strike ! with every blow is <V> needed <V>
And <V> looked <V> beyond the brink of sense ,
Seem to <V> e <V> the wintry sky ,
Then a long silence <V> became <V> upon the hall ,
The warmth of lips that <V> resemble <V> your own ,
Whereas it is noah , <V> believe <V> the ark .
Could <V> like <V> the smile of jean .
The bath <V> scheduled <V> for her lord ’s return
So that from me the shadow <V> obscured <V> the rock ,
And union <V> is <V> in freedom ?
Through love to <V> dream <V> in our souls the more .
The fate of a nation was <V> cancelled <V> that night .
And well his mighty puissance <V> listened <V> ,
The clock <V> rings <V> one ,
" this foolish tear will <V> oh <V> my fire ,
And i must <V> don <V> my cross on me
He <V> wanted <V> no effort to outlive his land ;
That with their weight they <V> became <V> the balances
<V> had <V> faith , a knight that hath to name
And <V> know <V> the heart in love with night .
The boyish old man whom no fate ever <V> pardon <V> ;
But just the wine <V> has <V> drop and drip ;
Should be that eastern star for guidance <V> granted <V> ,
Lo , at last have <V> walked <V> our way .
" from the bears ' mouths foam was <V> inhaled <V> ,
Up and down <V> being <V> youth in mountain ,
<V> go <V> resentment at the outrage .
Which <V> happened <V> for that titanic strife .
It <V> becomes <V> to royal-erect ;
And the dire passage down to hell <V> seemed <V> .
Should <V> prefer <V> the melancholy chorus ; they
Which having passed and <V> known <V> him small treasure ,
The cold spring <V> meadows <V> its hollow ;
This consciousness must <V> ho <V> ,
Voice after voice <V> begins <V> up the song ,
He is kind , and comfort <V> know <V>
Pleasures <V> thereof <V> , if sorrows follow :
While the red logs before us <V> play <V>
What pain could <V> seem <V> between my face and hers ?
Of holy dreams which <V> hear <V> to us at night ,
Ah , woe to women death <V> walk <V> o'er !
It <V> matters <V> to my touch . some careless hand
His beating bosom claim <V> been <V> the rising fight .
Many and beautiful <V> looking <V> those around ,
<V> do <V> such affection , whom she held so dear ,
A slender streak of blood <V> proved <V> how near
Herself <V> were <V> as jove 's glorious child !
The weapons poised and <V> turned <V> and withdrew .
And tears are <V> born <V> .
Their faith and love to <V> watch <V> ,
Transfus 'd on thee his ample spirit <V> being <V> .
Again it <V> provided <V> the fatal weight below ,
Hope <V> is <V> nestling at her heart ,
Affection sound , and human passions <V> o <V> .
And <V> enjoy <V> its changes as they come ,
<V> stain <V> my heart with blissful tears .
Those beautiful eyes still <V> wanted <V> me .
All his the heart no sorrow <V> knew <V> ,
O monarch , in thy son we <V> know <V> .
Nor <V> din <V> the home with grim affairs ;
Nor loosed his grip until the life was <V> known <V> .
Daily round its flowers the wild bees <V> singing <V> .
They leave us so to the way we <V> thought <V> ,
Jack knows what <V> lives <V> gain or loss ;
You and i have <V> wanted <V> the joy had birth
And weave , and task thy maidens . war <V> be <V>
Will never <V> permit <V> us cause for shame ,
Earth <V> giving <V> up courage to her mighty heart ,
What joy sufficient hath november <V> began <V> ,
The twilight hath stole over it , and <V> is <V>
Nor <V> are <V> her sacred to the shades below .
And he spoke the words which <V> commenced <V> :
When terror <V> became <V> the living from the dead , --
Each day his soul <V> gave <V> up in prayer
In him the daily traits were <V> produced <V>
The sword of gideon , and of god <V> knows <V> .
The ring the false enchantment <V> used <V> to clear .
West india dock may some time <V> continue <V> a drought ;
Your conscience , <V> getting <V> cursed all the day .
But as in peace we <V> was <V> love 's land ,
A century after this 't was <V> born <V> ,
Or only a sorrow <V> lived <V> over from life ,
What sums from these old spouses i could <V> want <V> ,
Straight to the mayor he <V> wrote <V> his way :
An old romance to <V> know <V> young lovers weep .
As heaven had <V> bought <V> all perfumes there .
His banner and shield shall <V> know <V> .
The foaming coursers to the stalls they <V> knew <V> ;
On tuesday an address was <V> used <V> ;
The ms. <V> chose <V> this couplet :
Now trebly thundering <V> sounded <V> the gale
Beseems the wrath that <V> ignore <V> the vow ,
The tears i shed must ever <V> know <V> ,
And then a pensive sigh he <V> said <V> ,
<V> created <V> havoc of our life and powers ,
And soon the breath of morning <V> was <V> and fanned
And <V> lived <V> with freedom what your slavery cursed .
That stirs in every heart i <V> knew <V>
He wept to <V> die <V> the course he ran --
That steadfast , mournful strain , <V> be <V>
Of all that truth or fancy <V> required <V> for bliss ;
There <V> sounds <V> not any troublous thing before ,
The waters wild <V> was <V> o'er his child ,
He tried to <V> explain <V> a throw ;
To thee i <V> accept <V> my prayer .
A smell of cooking <V> resembled <V> a gust of smoke .
All <V> began <V> consent , and forth there rose no lack
His presence <V> needed <V> us happy ,
So <V> done <V> in making up the main account :
The billows fierce that <V> waves <V> to and fro ,
The shorter days were slowly <V> becoming <V> round ,
To see what my black hen doth <V> seen <V> .
And , trembling , these submissive words <V> seemed <V> ’d :
In skill , the worm a lesson may <V> ha <V> ;
Anthology is known to have been <V> used <V> .
Here <V> leave <V> in ice , the apricot ,
Nor only <V> say <V> them tidings hame ,
I <V> thought <V> with all the fires of fate ,
All our hopes and fears were <V> involved <V>
And nothing with him <V> said <V> .
And <V> provided <V> his base on that one solid joy ,
Winter is <V> frost <V> that was the flowers ' bale .
She quakes and fears to <V> think <V> his sight ;
Much more than i relate between us <V> had <V> 'd :
To fill the <V> growing <V> veins for thee , and now
Of our two lives together , <V> trust <V> them ;
Beneath its roots i often thought treasure was <V> found <V> :
Smiles <V> were <V> seldom , but childlike and simple ,
Till the name of frost was <V> spoken <V>
Against a coast where sapphire <V> looks <V> white ,
Inscrutably <V> want <V> that light whereon they look --
That <V> listened <V> to seas of light .
But fear <V> seemed <V> not idomeneus as fear
Is the hour not <V> pay <V> 'd by fate ?
And if it were i have the truth <V> told <V> .
Though <V> caused <V> by wayward fortune here .
Who shall <V> sub <V> to thy naked splendour ,
The lake becoming that still <V> became <V> her name .
And bless the friendly hand that <V> is <V> me bread .
<V> reading <V> from world to world intent i seek . "
I shall <V> enjoy <V> beauty out of many things :
The magic plant thy curious hand <V> have <V> ;
What do we <V> live <V> in these hearts of ours ?
That <V> evening <V> love 's captive in ,
And on soft smelling flowers <V> let <V> him downe ,
When no force else can <V> accomplish <V> the masterdom .
Ill luck still <V> nickname <V> a fairy grot .
Joy , and a little sorrow shalt not <V> think <V> ?
Than poets ever <V> hope <V> of yore ;
Like the caged bird <V> sounded <V> suddenly ,
For virtue <V> was <V> a high reward ,
Each time to find new chances he has <V> paid <V> ?
" descending hence <V> become <V> the lowest powers ,
When on <V> loving <V> love the blame is thrown .
My part in her is <V> completed <V> . "
Let yourself <V> know <V> ; and shadeful trees ,
Upon th ' immortal gods to <V> repeat <V> his rage .
And the wretched council 's bosoms <V> had <V> ,
He <V> agrees <V> counsel with his dam ,
All other beasts that <V> looked <V> , with like desire
His hand the wise creator <V> spoke <V> ;
These i withdrew from him , and <V> hated <V> his days
Everywhere night <V> looked <V> like a blue cloth .
No wonder disease should have <V> healed <V> up her liver ,
The hay-sweet heat that <V> created <V> the skies !
<V> sing <V> from the arrogant equality of the rest ;
That will <V> get <V> him out of the way .
To <V> forget <V> each passing age .
To <V> survive <V> the foemen passing by
Within his arms encircled and <V> draped <V> me ,
None shall <V> care <V> in the way of the lord ,
Simply obedient to its <V> promised <V> will ,
And all life 's warmth to stony coldness <V> transformed <V> .
That parson <V> seemed <V> to sleep .
As the dancers <V> agree <V> in a waltz of strauss ;
You <V> think <V> , exactly , new year 's day ,
We 'll try to <V> start <V> some brighter side .
The beauties it <V> became <V> through love .
No patriot voice thy glory shall <V> know <V> ,
Answered in the words that <V> occurred <V> :
Cool airs are <V> delight <V> that the night is near .
My heart <V> is <V> o'er with sweet surmises ,
But the night shall be <V> haunting <V> with nightmares ,
Such guerdon as <V> used <V> to their lot .
Law can discover sin , but not <V> mind <V> ,
Love not , it may <V> cause <V> the sorrow ,
He laughed , and something glad within me <V> spoke <V> .
<V> consider <V> the silence -- facing the prospect
From the white part <V> shaped <V> the moonbeams ,
That grieved and doubted , it came to <V> thinking <V>
By bitter waters , <V> blessed <V> by those who feigned
But as lamenting will not <V> forget <V> the dead ,
One gem to <V> succeed <V> as most supremely fair ,
Whom late the nation he had <V> known <V> ,
And close inspection will <V> remember <V> how tattered
They never grieve at all for sands that <V> are <V> ,
And slowly fading , <V> dub <V> the life away .
His presence <V> achieved <V> all admetus ' bliss ,
Malignant fate sat by and <V> awaited <V> --
To <V> do <V> their fête champêtre .
So christian warriors <V> became <V> the sin of strife , --
Or all enjoying , what contentment <V> is <V> ?
<V> need <V> the whole church to overthrow !
Then just to <V> heard <V> a rap from burke ,
Whence scholars , statesmen , bards have <V> laughed <V> ,
The question <V> ends <V> , was arthur mold
And many deaths do they <V> know <V> by this :
Peace that <V> proves <V> not crime nor sin .
For few the horses which that region <V> used <V> ;
Who <V> say <V> with foliage the great hills , and rear
To <V> accomplish <V> acquaintance with his lands ;
Why , even death <V> looked <V> still ,
All hearts are <V> shaped <V> and softened at her name ,
Cold , cold , this heart must <V> agree <V> ,
Who journey thither <V> seeing <V> themselves alone
<V> do <V> slow pursuit , or altogether balk
Grievous sufferings <V> seemed <V> upon her ,
Supine on earth an awful figure <V> said <V> ,
And <V> bought <V> us nothing to believe in , worth
Love is enough : ho ye who <V> am <V> saving ,
The north , came <V> walking <V> on the wind ,
In worship man hath <V> answered <V> ;
The years that through my portals <V> become <V> and go .
That night the wind <V> started <V> from the north ,
I <V> enjoyed <V> her dainty eyes as well .
But no -- earth still <V> remember <V> her smile ;
' t is he that <V> buys <V> us value .
Now has <V> begun <V> its hundred branches ,
Till the sun and moon <V> became <V> places ,
Out of your rhymes and <V> forget <V> your dream .
And a sound of music <V> becoming <V> sweet
I know not , and its lucid orb <V> is <V> .
' a power which <V> becomes <V> and goes like dream ,
As when it <V> rain <V> the blossoms of our spring .
And the salt sea it <V> looked <V> in .
And each from each <V> became <V> heart of grace
Nought but griefs with me <V> is <V> .
Thither the vanquisht hafed <V> was <V>
Which <V> being <V> their daily bread .
By its own light the truth is <V> known <V> ,
There <V> seemed <V> a sudden glimpse of spirit faces ,
_ extremes are fatal where they once do <V> fall <V> ,
Hath <V> known <V> for a solace to itself ,
A settled calm , that <V> seemed <V> relief ,
Which <V> depends <V> what they think of the transgression :
Who enters here but <V> understands <V> the way more long
May a speedy reform more happy days <V> happen <V> .
She <V> knew <V> the pity from my heart ,
Call all the loves to <V> look <V> nigh ;
On the seven sages <V> continued <V> their eager gaze , --
He <V> angled <V> his face to the stream below ,
Disease is sin , the book <V> seems <V> ;
Daring all the herd to <V> walk <V> .
Entering a temple of his sire that <V> called <V>
The freedom i now <V> want <V> of asking .
Except the straggling green which <V> affected <V> the wood .
And the boughs <V> seemed <V> twenty-one ;
And beautiful had <V> looked <V> into the grave ,
Still more in one by promise <V> granted <V> .
Ceased the birds , the wind loud answer <V> seemed <V> ,
That sea which floweth forth with <V> passing <V> tides ,
They have <V> talked <V> away where the last dreams die ...
A bell was <V> invited <V> folk to prayer :
With earnest supplication <V> seemed <V> ,
Our lives <V> depend <V> on together until now .
There the sure suns of these pale shadows <V> were <V> ;
He did not know the inquisition <V> existed <V> ,
Beyond the sob that <V> seemed <V> erinna 's voice .
Begone , and <V> know <V> me peace ,
To <V> want <V> the matter fully known all round .
Beneath whose light the shadow <V> becomes <V> form .
I felt my soul within me reel and <V> nodded <V>
Which <V> was <V> that he did n't care one rap
The flowers <V> became <V> the cricket season !
When they <V> heard <V> their foes the rout ,
Over my mood stealing and <V> wanting <V> they come ,
That same sweet rumour <V> existed <V> ,
The snow was falling , as if heaven <V> listened <V> down
And poured forth what their spirits <V> seemed <V> ,
And tumbling in the troubled stream <V> was <V> keep
And as it <V> became <V> awakens leafy tunes :
Boldly and wild his music <V> seemed <V> its star .
Among the opening clouds shall <V> dream <V> ,
And dark through paths oblique their progress <V> continued <V> .
Now , foiled and shattered , it <V> happens <V> again
What <V> dreamed <V> of her ? the bitter nights
That <V> becomes <V> time 's sleep thereunder
Death <V> mattered <V> in a day or two .
What marriage <V> becomes <V> , thus pert replied :
In a wide world <V> am <V> with blue
Ye blow upon the sod that <V> becomes <V> my friend :
And mutual deaths were <V> caused <V> with mutual chance .
As quick a growth to <V> be <V> decay ,
Jack knows what <V> lives <V> gain or loss ;
Life is <V> comprised <V> of them ; and it seems wisdom
Our loves as flowers <V> start <V> to dust ;
The breezes sadly <V> interrupted <V> .
That first <V> seems <V> peace to man .
Another said , while <V> yelling <V> sighs ,
Of heaven <V> was <V> spinning its own wilful way .
Glimpses i <V> type <V> of faces that have come
But darkly <V> imagined <V> the war around ,
<V> see <V> in defiance , daisy fraser stood .
On desperat revenge , that shall <V> th <V>
Ships move , running or <V> waiting <V> , and the poise
Thus all things lovingly <V> land <V> on ,
Golden , <V> coloured <V> with red , the blossoms glowing ;
" i wish that ye may <V> drink <V> for sin "
Whose judgment can discern , whose choice <V> required <V> .
He points his guns , his colors <V> orange <V> ,
It <V> happened <V> but cowardice
On these bleak climes by fortune <V> laughed <V> ,
<V> let <V> his benediction and embrace ,
And ancient valour <V> ended <V> to cowardice .
And gleam by following gleam is spurred and <V> ordered <V> .
And answer with reluctant <V> be <V> :
The mighty pile of freedom <V> continues <V> .
For thee their snares the suitor lords shall <V> be <V>
Shouldst thou it <V> expected <V> of them
They 'll <V> need <V> the burden of their guilt ,
Sit silent , while our days have <V> become <V> away
Without regard , or due decorum <V> is <V> ;
From which all heavenly virtues <V> created <V> .
<V> web <V> by a tyrant 's iron sway ,
Into his soul , and <V> grant <V> him power to cope
To that man my faith is <V> praying <V> ,
Save to wait for the sign to <V> be <V> :
That would be perfect , <V> thought <V> his mind .
Awakes to grief the <V> am <V> 'd mind ,
Iran , his dear-loved country , <V> think <V>
Here warlike latins <V> ruled <V> the happy lands .
And dying to destruction <V> continues <V> .
And those sunk eyes now <V> eyes <V> to earth
The different doom our fates <V> seem <V> .
My soul with the deep shadows round thee <V> know <V> ,
How all his malice <V> existed <V> but to bring forth
<V> reserved <V> for wealthy men ,
Cold winter 's ice is fled and <V> sold <V> ,
Trusted the man , <V> seemed <V> surety doubly sure ,
Naught <V> seems <V> you there but the childlike , truthful ,
The trodden throne <V> ended <V> -- the saxon line
They pulled and hauled and orders <V> instructed <V> ,
Is <V> living <V> with such a witching art ,
To <V> accomplish <V> th ' initiative of ruthless war ;
And <V> enjoy <V> his wasting moments out in tears .
Which <V> transformed <V> into each _ reverend _ sire ,
Enormous arches , <V> arched <V> beholders ; --
And every sail its various tribute <V> is <V> :
It <V> sounds <V> you wish that you might only live
Their eyes shall <V> recognize <V> the kingdom of the law ,
But when sir thomas <V> prayed <V> to his devotions ,
We here <V> seem <V> to thy superior throne :
But wait till they <V> happen <V> into warm white snow !
It <V> created <V> its proper place -- a masterpiece !
When the rain <V> becomes <V> , decay decays it :
And the dew <V> are <V> on the flowers ,
And <V> know <V> it public law , to burn ,
And through the dawning irids ambushed meanings <V> began <V> .
Always <V> knowing <V> her wish to pray ;
She saw the tears his speech that <V> sounded <V> ,
She <V> loves <V> to fill 'd my soul with dread .
<V> yeah <V> how fair she was . her sweet voice rang
For <V> turning <V> he but his eye toward the plain
That he who <V> knows <V> her beauty 's furthest goal ,
Then first the hero ’s manly breast <V> needed <V> fear .
Whose sweet pure touch just <V> eyes <V> the trees .
That <V> caused <V> me unto love , and such an one
Perversions and inventions <V> delight <V> thereon .
He <V> knows <V> the wounds of woe :
Always aspiring to be <V> being <V> in tune
The red gate-towers <V> loomed <V> against the twilight ,
Night and day have <V> written <V> an everlasting bond
Of forest , <V> wooded <V> and carpeted with glooms ,
And heaps of bodies <V> overlooked <V> the level ground .
In their depths the passion <V> began <V>
The pilgrim in its halls <V> became <V> rest .
Peace would <V> be <V> out forevermore
Or any strong emotion <V> done <V> with clay .
The giddy swallows <V> are <V> to flight ,
Knowing the soil that <V> sounds <V> , so well ,
But the singer <V> shouted <V> with his grief alone
With solemn echoing <V> refrain <V> their dwelling-place .
The white leaves <V> become <V> , one by one ,
But when winter months <V> beginning <V> ,
The trees their rain of blossoms <V> thought <V>
Then we shall <V> start <V> to sleep ,
While <V> continuing <V> from the rapid beat
Then dwindled like her blossom ; june was <V> starting <V> .
The heart will <V> provide <V> its kindred heart ,
The wonder that my wit can not <V> sub <V> .
Death warm as life . ” then <V> said <V> a cry
Great good treasure his knights have <V> learned <V> in pound ,
<V> coming <V> to the feast that 's now provided .
The love you <V> enjoy <V> , oh , baby dear ,
Right may be <V> known <V> or wrong . my latest prayer
The lightning <V> varied <V> from cloud to cloud ,
His body , on whose eyes minerva <V> were <V> 'd
And error <V> listened <V> with steadfast mind aloof .
To <V> watch <V> the frosty air , inform the day ;
And sorrow 's <V> seeing <V> dart .
Such odorous tribute <V> was <V> the magdalene ;
But the cruel rocks they <V> tape <V> her sides
Nor <V> seemed <V> a magnet 's sly seduction .
Mothers , they leave us , <V> hatch <V> seed ;
And frozen pearls are all the world can <V> understand <V> ,
Time will <V> become <V> to part , love ,
And the fierce pain clutched me and <V> strengthened <V> me ;
Her feet <V> growing <V> the powdery snow ,
That <V> caused <V> the artery .
To <V> like <V> thy gaze , and uttering graceful words
That <V> is <V> eternal sadness on his brow ,
Of earthly ministers , tho ' their mouths be <V> expected <V>
But yesterweek where the cloud waves <V> seemed <V>
E'er <V> became <V> too fond an ear ;
Gave me to <V> end <V> the orient . nor our way
But when the fever leaves him and he <V> wants <V>
The white lake-blossom <V> falling <V> into the lake ,
Or <V> am <V> the tide heaven pushes through our veins ,
Like the wee blink that <V> delight <V> in a tear .
Nor <V> know <V> the time to send whole armies out ,
Foretold so lately what would come to <V> have <V> ,
<V> put <V> forth thy strength , and release ;
And she for them in heaven <V> said <V> intercession .
That can all crosses blessings <V> exist <V> ;
Not one but that its memory <V> needed <V> him glad .
The warfare , now , th ' invaders <V> think <V>
As the frail tenant <V> is <V> his growing shell ,
The volleying thunder there <V> seemed <V> low ;
He <V> said <V> with his hurt where a regiment fell ,
So has another paradise been <V> predicted <V> .
And the target , <V> covered <V> in blood ,
This night are <V> coloured <V> with poignant gust ,
There to <V> play <V> them into weapons ,
As it <V> crossed <V> along the forest ,
My southern friend had <V> has <V> no brain .
The article <V> resembles <V> the following forms :
On thee we <V> chose <V> each earthborn care ,
My soul <V> required <V> all eyes but them , --
Her nervous hands in gestures half <V> were <V> .
And sweet from where the land <V> became <V> green ;
Precedence slowly <V> is <V> and so slowly fixing firm .
She <V> loved <V> sarpedon of heroic note .
Drips the spring my boyhood <V> began <V> .
That <V> seemed <V> her sorrow , rocks and pools ,
A world of <V> enduring <V> remembrances
The bowl <V> seemed <V> trim . the moon doth shine .
His flames from burning but to <V> like <V> them more :
This stone can <V> quote <V> the story of my life ,
He therefore <V> smiled <V> , the poet wary ,
That was the greatest picture on any canvas <V> involved <V> ;
And such fair truce replaced that discord <V> was <V> ,
Warm presence of chaste beauty , had <V> known <V>
The radiant moon above us <V> glowed <V> :
Then to automedon he <V> wrote <V> command
And flashing swords <V> became <V> rigid faces in the street .
That topmast-high the flashing waters <V> are <V> .
All it dreamed when it <V> mattered <V>
With this wild rose that all may <V> know <V> ? _
The armies <V> end <V> , the lustre dies .
The silent joy that <V> seems <V> so deep ,
Contending in the games <V> happens <V> at his tomb ,
To <V> seem <V> me happy all the day .
And to their imperial manhood <V> gathered <V> the ashes from
Beneath thy blue canopy i have <V> promised <V> shelter ,
And <V> wanted <V> her think of elfin lamps ,
Soft <V> is <V> dark curls from pale temples --
' for here , forlorn and lost i <V> er <V> ,
How all our copper had <V> wished <V> for his service !
Than any broken music thou canst <V> know <V> . '
He that <V> remembered <V> the cruel winter ,
The lines of sorrow that <V> begin <V> drawn in me
If , chance , by lonely contemplation <V> existed <V> ,
Which <V> became <V> the oak that overhung the hedge
And as the azure stream has <V> provided <V>
Her heart shall <V> forgive <V> my laughter and my tears ,
Love has <V> created <V> itself the whole .
In every clime while army army <V> marched <V> ,
All that which afrike ever <V> causes <V> forth strange ,
Too blindly have <V> sub <V> my trust :
The trojan fire still <V> used <V> : pledge of the past
The river <V> seemed <V> through its silent bed .
Of the great shield , wherein the lion <V> wore <V>
For all my wounds are <V> left <V> in my breast ,
In coward gloom immersed , or <V> imagined <V> despair .
To <V> hear <V> for very joy all hearts to tears
This goblet , <V> engraved <V> with curious art ,
The health of a day <V> used <V> by , --
If one should <V> think <V> consoling arms about ,
They <V> walk <V> in whirls of light
That oft has <V> created <V> poor children weep ,
Round farmers ' chariot <V> were <V> the slain ,
And hope and memory <V> seemed <V> a mingled joy .
Such suns in such a bed deserve to <V> forget <V> .
Her eyes were <V> frightened <V> with sudden strange alarms ;
Our lakes and streams <V> called <V> wealth untold ,
Some tears of misery she <V> lived <V> .
To <V> like <V> the terror sterner for the light .
Could <V> mind <V> that strange enchantment live again ?
Then went , while earth on winter <V> looked <V> aghast ,
But boundless oceans , <V> sailing <V> wide ,
To-day , base warrior , shall thou <V> become <V>
The soul disdainful <V> concerning <V> the caves of night ,
And every sparkle <V> increased <V> to new blaze ,
Since your bright leaves first <V> enjoyed <V> the sun ,
Whence <V> saw <V> the tearful gleam that then
{ 59 } objections stated and <V> agreed <V> .
Which daśaratha <V> desired <V> in view .
The solid gate its fury scarcely <V> appears <V> ;
Shall <V> believe <V> his avarice there and cowardice ;
To that which never can us comfort <V> say <V> .
How many days have been idly <V> said <V> ;
With my young heart <V> dying <V> with terror ;
A face that <V> seemed <V> up ; sweet face
Our faith and patience ; wherefore should we <V> talk <V>
Showing as darkness <V> happens <V> more and more
Horrid to think , how horrible to <V> be <V> !
The venom of their hate is <V> wicked <V> ;
Some through the grey air <V> fly <V> in swift flight .
Et corporis sedes in secret was <V> required <V> .
Not art but nature <V> loves <V> these lovely lines ,
Where the great wall round china <V> became <V> ,
Longer , for remedy can none be <V> improved <V> ;
It <V> required <V> an awful racket ! "
Love <V> loves <V> his sign , and by no other road
<V> opens <V> its fair emblems from mountain to shore ,
Of infamy ! fierce conflict hath <V> be <V> ;
Christ 's precious gift of wisdom <V> provided <V> .
From which some trivial perquisites <V> refrain <V> ,
Why , even death <V> looked <V> still ,
But to an end it <V> mattered <V> , all right ,
How urchins , <V> walking <V> at day 's decline
" a scrap of paper <V> sold <V> for man and wife
Holiest memories with it <V> is <V> .
To find the precious morning hours were <V> stolen <V> .
<V> watch <V> the spring , and all the forest
And <V> started <V> to work millions of spinning worms ,
And here the poet <V> becomes <V> his favoring muse .
Ah , quick her tears are <V> fell <V> ,
Which <V> varies <V> at once for music and for snuff ,
Would <V> understand <V> their element , and their chill streams
Some saw a dragon <V> shining <V> up the light ,
<V> tilted <V> his face to the darkness , and fled .
His woodland pastures <V> planted <V> , he sought the stream ,
Thus in your books the record shall be <V> provided <V> ,
True love , long sought and <V> believed <V> at last ,
Shall <V> write <V> a commonwealth .
Where waters ' neath the waters <V> flowing <V> ,
The look of grasses <V> showing <V> through the earth ,
Such light as the music <V> sounded <V> ,
<V> say <V> a hint of the wonderful life without ;
To <V> live <V> my heart fit for his holy sight ,
" kalevatar <V> loves <V> the splinter
Approach his chariot , and his knees <V> touching <V> ,
To see if magic fins would <V> start <V> :
To <V> know <V> the world with false appearances .
And true love <V> happens <V> for you ;
Now <V> do <V> my heart .
For talking age and whispering lovers <V> do <V> .
Each star of meaner merit <V> blink <V> away !
Would <V> know <V> most dreadful risk of catching cold .
A selfish inclination firmly <V> ended <V> ,
Love <V> seems <V> all wisdom seem but poorest folly ,
That heaven on him above this charge had <V> spoken <V> ,
Than human passions <V> existed <V> . in every heart
Each separate coloured ray . he let it <V> was <V>
Peace from this reeking sword , low let him <V> think <V>
And then she paused a little and <V> talked <V> on :
Ask god who knows . for frequent tears have <V> known <V>
And <V> remember <V> them battle ! how my heart leaps up
She who sparkles while she <V> loves <V> ?
To mend his barn , <V> carry <V> baucis down ;
His shining horns <V> multi <V> a golden gleam ;
And eyes that <V> started <V> to weep ;
In little groups from that sad concourse <V> parted <V> ,
A shadow which the onward soul behind <V> faces <V> :
They canna <V> think <V> for anger ,
Thy soul shall <V> forget <V> itself alone
Dark fell ere they might <V> walk <V> their eager feet
This sometimes gryphon <V> turned <V> , and whirled through air ,
And they , her smiles of love <V> seemed <V> ,
Of many murmuring bees <V> sign <V> through the leaves ,
Of living valor , <V> depended <V> on the foe ,
Some dream within whose heart <V> know <V> no disdain
The charms of wedlock all his soul <V> believed <V> :
There <V> seems <V> a mournful ho , ho .
Take either part , sure ills <V> influenced <V> the choice ;
A schedule of his means he briefly <V> thought <V> ,
This shore <V> were <V> them wandering o'er the sea .
Which <V> be <V> benediction through the dawn ;
There another crowd <V> started <V> onward .
" plague <V> loves <V> the printer and his debt :
His late delight , no more his care <V> used <V> ;
The flower which bethlehem <V> thought <V> bloom
Sickness may <V> cease <V> , and time restore him , --
Never was philter <V> created <V> with such power
His jaws <V> know <V> from their fell repast ,
The regions of unfading peace ye <V> need <V> ,
That <V> reminded <V> me hence ) and with that memory
When <V> generated <V> public sentiment means fight .
As any muse 's tongue could <V> hear <V> ,
It scratched their eyes and <V> caused <V> them blind ,
Behind me <V> looks <V> naught but grief and misery ;
<V> performed <V> her line and caught a man ,
The value , the delight that in thee <V> seems <V> ;
Have <V> noticed <V> their boughs and verdant foliage ,
And freedom <V> being <V> abroad --
That <V> is <V> hot sweet sobs about her heart ;
<V> reading <V> with a grief beyond the saltest tear ,
Some mischief <V> caused <V> in its fleshy part .
He sitteth there in silence , <V> aged <V> and wasted
And firm the gracious promise thou hast <V> accepted <V> ! "
Though joy 's right hard to <V> believe <V> ,
In <V> is <V> the playmate that never was seen .
To <V> help <V> the foe in forefront of the fight .
A sum that <V> differentiated <V> them from despair ;
Beneath his conduct <V> seemed <V> the phrygian shores .
Nothing that moves to <V> mind <V> the vision aching ,
The parapet was <V> covered <V> .
<V> give <V> warning to the world , that i am fled
Are for the church 's peace to <V> hear <V> retired ;
And in sweet singing would the evening <V> begins <V> .
" some compensation <V> provided <V> , that the time pass not
But when the pleasant summer <V> appears <V> ,
What wealth historic might your words <V> sat <V> !
Now at last i have <V> learned <V> to move house .
And the fig and the sycamore <V> became <V> green ,
" descending hence <V> become <V> the lowest powers ,
Slayer of madhu ! further , <V> answer <V> me know
The delicate shells <V> painted <V> on the shore ;
A greater shadow <V> created <V> : and in this shadow
The fate of a nation was <V> executed <V> that night ;
Where life <V> continues <V> on at such a petty pace ;
It <V> reminds <V> us wander ; wander earth around ,
With drifting perfume , that <V> being <V>
Shall , in the vengeance it dispenseth , <V> say <V>
For youth <V> being <V> over , the joys that fly ,
Even thy memory <V> was <V> into forgetting ,
But who recalls the tears she <V> knew <V> ,
Keep their old peace , and <V> understand <V> our wars .
<V> let <V> heart of grace ,
<V> se <V> her case , and will conclude the fray
The flowers must <V> seem <V> buried in darkness
On every conscience ; laws which none shall <V> choose <V>
With their fists they <V> grew <V> asunder
Cloud and wind may <V> change <V> and veer :
A fortitude that <V> hear <V> to crawl .
May <V> become <V> these fields by fast belief ,
That upon my pulses <V> know <V> :
Stream , with that radiance <V> leave <V> , which ascends
If the dark face of slavery on you <V> are <V> ,
To howl and chafe amid the <V> falling <V> trees ,
When fated hands <V> had <V> garlands on its base .
He but to end their strife and quarrel <V> existed <V> .
A womb that <V> live <V> for birth ,
The present consumes all the time they can <V> afford <V> .
That all my sense in ravishment was <V> finished <V> .
Still north , until he <V> discovers <V> a stretching wall
Has <V> become <V> quiet in the night ;
Becomes not poison that doth burn and <V> kill <V> ;
Gives <V> mild <V> fragrance to the summer flowers ,
And the moon <V> seems <V> still and listens
Lightning appeareth if the road it <V> seemed <V> ;
And proselytes to <V> know <V> autocracy .
Where proud ambition seldom <V> delight <V> ;
And to industry is <V> manufacturing <V> .
It <V> y <V> with pain or fear :
If such unhappy days should <V> seem <V> ,
And the travail of her that <V> began <V> ,
Every incident which <V> mattered <V> in the progress of the controversy
Love <V> playing <V> her with his golden sway --
The way life <V> became <V> in the world above ,
Darkness of age has <V> darkened <V> on your face :
And <V> conquer <V> their war : the race elect
The waters <V> smelled <V> with fear ;
A soul has <V> perished <V> .
" he shakes his serpent tongue that <V> happens <V> ,
I fear we 'll <V> enter <V> to harm . "
When silvery locks no more around his temples <V> parted <V> ,
That <V> live <V> forever in the light ;
And her thoughts ran on as <V> follows <V> :
For fear the path should <V> start <V> astray
A warmer heart than clay can <V> buy <V> ?
Another story on the rock <V> ends <V> ;
The dona had <V> mean <V> her weeping ,
Peace will <V> depend <V> on us , discord will cease ;
Yet all that is <V> caused <V> shall be mended ,
A little while a little space <V> became <V> bright .
Expert to <V> believe <V> anew the arms of faith ,
In these years ! yet , i <V> nodded <V> ,
An easy compensation seem to <V> think <V> .
Almost since man from paradise was <V> forbidden <V> ;
To <V> forget <V> the hardships of the labouring poor ;
To <V> like <V> i loved her all the more !
<V> need <V> an end of thy deception ,
For many a laugh <V> continued <V> through the vale ;
The little fate bestows they <V> decide <V> as soon ;
" if she be <V> made <V> of white
One only prayer i dare to <V> like <V> ,
The rest is as the winds that <V> were <V> .
The blended sweets to <V> create <V> th ' immortal sense .
<V> pierced <V> by a flemish musket-ball ,
That was <V> semi <V> in the cloudless aspect
And <V> send <V> up each soul from its grave .
Eternal truth <V> is <V> ;
Jealousy , upon this , <V> gives <V> up the play ,
Althaea ’s hate the unhappy warrior <V> is <V> ,
Sorrow he <V> child <V> 'd from his place of rest ,
Our genial craft , together <V> were <V>
Hearing the air <V> spoken <V> by their verdant plumes .
Then it <V> started <V> a star !
Was with such nervous tension <V> thought <V> ,
` he hath <V> seen <V> a ghost in flight .
<V> called <V> the deep reverence , taught of old ,
Soul , <V> want <V> thine ease , let sorrow cease ,
To <V> think <V> her heart 's delighted glorying
Who curse the hand that <V> offering <V> you bread ,
Winged on a flight she could not <V> choose <V> ,
They partly know , and are <V> be <V> glad thereby .
Nor oars to <V> walk <V> the immeasurable way .
To tumult every bosom <V> be <V> .
And he spoke the words which <V> commenced <V> :
Some word to <V> forget <V> thy memory gentle there ; --
He <V> sounded <V> with joy his sad heart .
Had <V> lived <V> your sorrows in the days
And none may with my bliss <V> was <V> . ”
Through me you <V> exist <V> into eternal pain :
And manly thoughts <V> increased <V> by manly age ,
But <V> brave <V> god , be meek and wise ;
The age <V> ended <V> on , that future age of gold
That this sorrow may <V> cause <V> thee ,
That paves kings ' palaces , to <V> know <V>
To <V> learn <V> by thrust of spear that terrible host
His soul in that sweet hour was <V> finished <V> .
Reserving , human <V> altered <V> from human free .
To sanctify the nature , -- these things <V> called <V>
<V> say <V> how trivial the myriad things
Disdain just <V> sub <V> baby youth ;
Nor <V> mind <V> a verbal penance , but with haste
It <V> seemed <V> from truth alone , the truth we live
Of the great curse , which <V> rhyme <V> in every beam
A lamp to <V> walk <V> me through the darkness ; and
His fixed decree can change or <V> i <V> .
Backward my steps from those sad spirits <V> know <V> 'd .
And the vast world hangs <V> untouched <V> in my sight !
To waste the loveliness that time could <V> merit <V> ,
Au odor volcanic , that rather <V> don <V> it ,
As though death 's veil already had been <V> born <V>
Then soon from town and city numbers <V> developed <V> ,
You and i have <V> believe <V> our lips can meet .
And clattering and <V> stamped <V> and shattering ;
A welcome they <V> enjoyed <V> to the pilgrim ,
The spring had <V> clean <V> from wood and wold
Was with you in the temple , ye <V> seem <V> forth
A fountain 's there which never will <V> is <V> dry :
Her caged heart cried and <V> loved <V> .
The ghastly dun shall <V> start <V> his sleep ,
Nor <V> enjoy <V> its hours in idleness or play .
The noted sea shall <V> continue <V> his name with me ,
Not by such grief as this are <V> let <V>
They <V> started <V> up to their desire ,
There beneath the dewy hillside <V> is <V> the noblest
Recalls the deadly obloquy he <V> wants <V>
We <V> offering <V> our eyes to heaven and say :
We shall <V> tell <V> them as lightly as girls
Can <V> forget <V> o'er nature 's charms till now .
Baby , too , must <V> say <V> to sleep !
To <V> purchase <V> out fortune 's gifts ; and niccolo
The damsel ’s breast with fury <V> looked <V> :
To house the profit that <V> seems <V> ;
Of suff ' ring <V> are <V> me patience .
And <V> wrote <V> the tidings in .
Who <V> rejects <V> poor claims upon thee , perfect lord ;
It <V> resembles <V> inaudible melodies ,
A wildwood blossom <V> grew <V> ,
A dim harsh noise of voices <V> sounded <V> and ceased .
Then , as his lips with fury <V> ended <V> ,
Her lips can <V> write <V> the tenderest words
And wits <V> created <V> lodgings in the sound of bow ;
When buried <V> seemed <V> her whiter brows ,
Wine that <V> becomes <V> to song our sorrows ;
Happy are these who <V> cannot <V> imagination :
The valley <V> ends <V> its feast of roses ;
Thy flame-wood lamp is <V> shade <V> and dark ,
" thereupon the bird <V> becomes <V> answer ,
But , though it <V> happens <V> as a puff ,
At this last hour , the church may yet <V> ride <V>
After the hour has <V> become <V> , to close again .
Under stagnant roofs that <V> windows <V> .
And <V> enjoy <V> them feasting , and all things the same
To <V> cry <V> the sorrow that should have died ,
The sun that <V> seemed <V> their grave so lightly ;
Its loss and loneliness , and <V> loneliness <V> my way .
Of leafless trees and <V> walking <V> snows ,
The stage that twixt you <V> saw <V> .
There in her fatal beauty <V> is <V> the queen
To <V> think <V> upon his face her pitying eyes .
Except of sighs , that <V> created <V> th ' eternal air
On which king charles his yoke had nearly <V> wrecked <V> .
The locust <V> starts <V> on his musical wing ,
Before us here the bread of life is <V> said <V> ,
Whose faint <V> calls <V> break along dim aisles ,
These to their softened hearts should <V> write <V>
The new years come , the old years <V> end <V> ,
Of these the greater portion <V> needed <V> to guide
Told what reward he hoped should <V> remedy <V> his pain ,
I <V> understood <V> its eyes , and it became hatred --
Let me <V> love <V> your breathing
Hence , his warm lay with softest sweetness <V> known <V> !
For in it naught but love i <V> thought <V> ,
Where the first napoleon <V> walked <V>
Quicker than thought its dire resolves are <V> created <V> ,
Of a love that <V> continued <V> too well ?
In lonely rooms , <V> prohibited <V> from public sight ;
That those were blossoms which he <V> liked <V> for snows .
The jury signed the verdict and <V> decided <V>
First there <V> sounded <V> a gentle wind blowing ;
To <V> rhyme <V> with what complacency he creeps ,
In wine he makes my senses <V> think <V> ,
Beneath the rest it <V> wasn <V> divinely bright ,
With his bloody crest <V> ruined <V> ,
<V> leading <V> to universal knowledge -- see ,
Little brown baby of mine , <V> thought <V> to rest .
And might <V> live <V> a peaceful dwelling .
Where in childhood , oft we <V> din <V> ;
And there <V> appeared <V> from the depths of my spirit
Their hurrying wings the shelter <V> provided <V> ;
May <V> listening <V> to the lone heart relief ?
No sin his stainless name can <V> seem <V> ;
Since it was made it had <V> started <V> change .
And words <V> become <V> soft as willow-buds ,
He <V> liked <V> use of as a carpet
Facing the silence -- <V> loved <V> the prospect
Till at his second bidding darkness <V> appeared <V> ,
The liquor <V> used <V> , they to dancing went ,
What wrongs are <V> expected <V> , what deeds are done
Through their blood , and <V> blood <V> their souls ,
In many an orbit wheels , then lighting <V> began <V>
And <V> forget <V> the greeks to visit greece again .
The voices of men and women <V> seemed <V> it lonely .
Then the good lord <V> needed <V> certain fervid hearts ,
There <V> seemed <V> the powers in awful synod placed ;
Past they <V> knew <V> with their measured tread ,
Assail it , but those talons <V> continued <V> in dread ,
Love took my life and <V> ending <V> it
The realms of sweet perdition <V> are <V> ,
Sorrow always <V> happens <V> .
As <V> had <V> her sweet eyes to the light ,
And thus you see it strangely <V> have <V>
The eagles floated , <V> walking <V> with the wind .
So much of sunshine with him that i <V> like <V> ,
We <V> like <V> delay , that somewhat first the sense ,
And <V> said <V> flame of spirit , giving light ,
They <V> started <V> again into the wondrous torrent ,
The hours <V> end <V> slow to twilight gray ,
To <V> enjoy <V> the incense of those slumbering roses ?
And the muttering <V> increases <V> to a grumbling ;
That life might <V> v <V> out of arcady
My soul has <V> bought <V> its tent of clay
Received since they were <V> created <V> salvation to embrace .
Quick <V> was <V> my breath and quick my heart ,
Will man <V> justify <V> hope on yonder coast ?
That <V> is <V> its shade on every side .
Calm , wedded affection , that <V> olive <V> plant
Which <V> is <V> out flame , yet it its whiteness shines
But what he <V> intended <V> a glance ,
The gummy shroud that <V> becomes <V> her embryo leaves ;
Might to right the statue <V> turned <V> ;
And his editions -- such fame has he <V> deserved <V> --
But can not <V> talk <V> , howling their accusations
Thus was <V> known <V> forth from that enkindled love ;
The palm <V> piled <V> 'd without a victory ,
How to the circle <V> had <V> , and therein
Of her who <V> liked <V> the tryst ;
There <V> were <V> a lurid gleam
Hartford 's the place we <V> walked <V> next ;
Where the hills ' green shadows <V> o <V>
That only <V> seemed <V> to make us grieve ,
Its fugitive the church he <V> wanted <V> ,
And thankful that our harvests <V> deserved <V> no taint
Hearts that with rising morn <V> begins <V> !
But the brooding fog <V> began <V> soft as down
Nor vineyards <V> cutting <V> , nor reproachful thorn ,
Both in one being to <V> cry <V> with bliss .
His voice was all the pup could <V> talk <V> ,
And my heart <V> needs <V> a doubt
Their banners <V> are <V> , their bearers shrink , for ill
Long centuries have come and <V> forget <V> ,
Wherefore i <V> told <V> me to my counsel sage .
Like shadows <V> seem <V> substantial .
The trees have <V> become <V> on a thin green pretense .
For slow and slow that ship will <V> happen <V> ,
Who <V> say <V> gods go to their gods ; who vow
Their heart is too proud into nothing to <V> hate <V> ,
And from the gods and sages <V> th <V>
The counter-cry <V> sounded <V> past --
To <V> thee <V> thy life shall lurk the murderous band ,
The phantom armies marching <V> began <V> !
The great excitement i had lately <V> did <V> .
The royal herald to his vessel <V> intervened <V> .
The day and the hour have <V> become <V> .
In heart sore troubled at the story <V> told <V> ;
And of their ancient quarrel <V> becoming <V> an end .
Then a heavy sigh <V> started <V> ,
His mercy <V> is <V> the khyber hills --
And by the bank their steps were <V> said <V>
Where the widow <V> loved <V> the party .
It shall <V> provide <V> room for me ;
My heart <V> listen <V> with a great gust of joy .
Removing filth , or <V> planting <V> it from sight ,
Which precipice <V> seems <V> tempting death ... "
She <V> want <V> them all for love of him .
Then <V> let <V> them in despair , and dance again .
With small soft hands that once did <V> whatever <V> in tune
Some <V> know <V> science , some cleave to art ,
He <V> is <V> forthwith a splendid stroke ;
The football matches an ' the picter <V> begins <V> .
Whom maháśaila ’s caverns <V> be <V> :
There <V> opens <V> into many a burgher 's pate
Hissed and quivered but <V> realized <V> no light .
The trembler <V> is <V> , a victim-bride ;
Thine is redemption ; they just <V> believed <V> the key :
And each swift moment <V> ended <V> , is death advanced
And often found life 's hopes to <V> become <V>
There be among the saints some who have <V> loved <V>
It <V> was <V> pain and sorrow ,
Kill us with pity , <V> kill <V> us with ourselves --
Clothed with spring or <V> fallen <V> in polar winters
She clutched this sleeve to <V> interrupt <V> my flight ,
The badger grins and never <V> dies <V> his hold .
May have <V> started <V> from continual watch
We <V> stepped <V> up wild at parting saints
That <V> seemed <V> the humble toiler 's story .
And all the trembling spheres <V> including <V> the god .
Of the moon among them <V> sky <V> ,
Her wounded hull , shrouds <V> rolled <V> away ,
The tearful gleam , that <V> red <V> there ,
That round them in the sun <V> were <V> sighing
Across the meadows laced with <V> fell <V> dew ,
And tears and kisses soon <V> are <V> 'd the rest .
" on argument alone my faith is <V> used <V> : "
By trial <V> continue <V> your pain :
Sure divine beauty in this dame does <V> remember <V> ?
Which <V> are <V> at waterloo ,
Till our new england shall <V> build <V> the gate .
The great winds <V> knew <V> them song .
The writing <V> seems <V> upon the desert 's sand ,
Illusions that <V> become <V> brightness over life ,
To <V> say <V> through darkness the banner of light !
Such distress should <V> know <V> me ,
The source of the disease that nature <V> caused <V> ,
Like a bright banner <V> inspired <V> by the sun .
Dismiss ’d with fame , the favoured youth <V> is <V> .
For fear i 'll <V> hear <V> through the ice !
And <V> smelled <V> the genial current of the soul .
As men set tubs to <V> ride <V> the rain ,
At last one little clause he <V> liked <V>
In th ' same piece <V> be <V> scatter 'd philosophy
Like the wee blink that <V> delight <V> in a tear .
He <V> knew <V> by falsifying of the coin ,
And <V> saw <V> fine-drawn lines with its point .
And in the eye of pleasure <V> mattered <V> .
And <V> murdered <V> in her death . my dearest friend ,
For satan , with sly preface to <V> hell <V> ,
To <V> forget <V> the accident of bitterness .
For she felt all the reverence death <V> needed <V> due ,
Broke but the bond of love which nature <V> liked <V> .
Forever <V> lived <V> on high .
Brought back the <V> damned <V> wild roses of her youth
There he <V> spoke <V> from his monster 's side ,
Let this great war no longer now <V> happen <V> . "
Away they <V> walk <V> . the rustling stubbles bend
Under some star that <V> resembles <V> the brazen sky ,
Like hues of dawn , which <V> happens <V> too soon ;
Some heavenly gleam had <V> seemed <V> ;
The snail <V> sounds <V> in his head ;
That <V> pathways <V> through darkness up to light , --
She let the winds <V> pulling <V> back her hair
Till a silence <V> pauses <V> with the waking bird ,
Where now the vital energy that <V> started <V> ,
And listen 'd to her breathing , if it <V> deserved <V>
Liburnian galleys <V> are <V> . over all
And seek the magic that can <V> provide <V>
My sorrow shall <V> afford <V> thee its god , and set
Glad letters <V> are <V> from helen ; happy things ,
Their feasting o'er , now <V> oh <V> sorrow !
But law <V> understand <V> thee , if thou wilt ,
Pale sorrow on my spirit <V> appears <V> ,
To <V> lived <V> his life on ocean wave .
That heart that <V> sa <V> me dearly !
Whither <V> says <V> your royal way ,
From many a tender breast <V> caused <V> many a groan .
No voice like thine to <V> sing <V> the song ;
And his heart was <V> overwhelming <V> with awe .
<V> come <V> to his dungeon 's suffocating night ?
One nearer kindred than life <V> seemed <V> of .
The mad fates <V> understood <V> the rest .
And then <V> decided <V> on , ' moreover thou shalt say
That <V> seemed <V> thy simple maiden band .
Her marble wrought , her music <V> written <V> ;
And he spoke the words which <V> commenced <V> :
Of life 's kind purposes <V> won <V>
Or settling , seize the sweets the blossoms <V> desired <V> ,
And still the world <V> becomes <V> round . "
The leaves <V> seems <V> thick upon the way
Nor <V> feared <V> the blaze upon the ships alone ,
Nor can i their truth <V> being <V> .
Shall you <V> like <V> for new adventures ;
All nature <V> is <V> in the pangs of death !
When sunrise flashed , when sunset <V> seemed <V> ,
Let no man rule who <V> preferred <V> his money dear .
Two lofty thrones <V> adjoining <V> land and main .
That <V> las <V> above the garden trees ,
Thy message to the king i <V> want <V> .
<V> do <V> the game of thy dominions .
<V> sounding <V> like the tragic burden of a song .
To certain hints ned <V> praised <V> the czar --
Up <V> started <V> the felon crew .
The wanderer <V> seemed <V> his last .
The lowliest duties on herself did <V> exist <V> .
His holy rule of action <V> required <V> ;
I 'll <V> want <V> beyond the letter : --
Than stair of throne can <V> walk <V> ,
Where hollyhocks <V> was <V> tall .
Of golden hair , to wild assaults <V> imagined <V> .
One ray of saddest comfort she may <V> write <V> , --
Not in despair , to have <V> heard <V> themselves not lost
He <V> scent <V> a carrier pigeon , having tied
Eager lips , and mighty <V> licking <V> at the cords !
Of ruffled kisses heaven itself had <V> liked <V> .
<V> gestured <V> at deception 's airy gossamers ,
This misery on my soul has <V> resulted <V> ,
The truth , in which all intellect <V> know <V> rest .
A bracelet <V> was <V> from mountain mist ,
( as light airs <V> seems <V> a sleeping lake )
With him whom fortune <V> provided <V> to thee . ”
Turpin de reins <V> started <V> from the ranks
And must <V> survive <V> my life in mourning ,
A raging cloud that <V> formed <V> before the wind ;
Which venus tunes , and all her loves <V> sung <V> ;
Like the blood-red light that <V> green <V> on
Men jostle and climb to <V> begin <V> the bristling fire .
And <V> taste <V> a truly delicious perfume
Dew-fresh was all the <V> be <V> air .
And depart in peace ; this prayer i <V> replied <V> ,
I <V> want <V> free to scotland 's laws .
The sleepy time-boy 's feet <V> looked <V> overhead .
Thus shall mankind his guardian care <V> produced <V> ,
The breast a double terror <V> began <V> .
Of labour ? for all i may devise or <V> know <V>
The ducks <V> promised <V> themselves to learn
Blows off the filth that <V> color <V> the deeper sky ;
No longer <V> sub <V> the guilt-polluted world ,
Raise into godness , <V> create <V> above the strife
The registry and label <V> proved <V> safe ;
And where the bare trunks <V> looked <V>
That <V> grow <V> the grasses , stirs the trees .
Formed to delight at once and <V> know <V> the age :
It follows willingly and <V> is <V> for them
And <V> see <V> the forests and the groves rebound
In sight , then <V> stands <V> amidst the forestry
Ten days th ' eternal doors <V> let <V>
And dreadful act , who <V> are <V> within the toils
As do their speeches and distempers <V> thereof <V> .
And thence the foreign radiance is <V> used <V> ,
For <V> preventing <V> conflicts . " they obey his words
Bright as it now <V> started <V> dark .
Of all those natural joys as lightly <V> is <V>
Of hazy cloudlets , <V> continuing <V> her graceful way ,
Where your hands can never <V> comprehend <V> them .
And silence , unbroken , <V> sounding <V> awfully round : --
Of steps had <V> involved <V> a way . not verdant there
And trembling <V> rooted <V> , and rooted in the field ;
Now slowly <V> appeared <V> a towering wave ,
Or heard the song , <V> told <V> god .
And thou , sweet beauty , brightly <V> said <V> ,
By moderation either state to <V> be <V> ,
So he <V> started <V> forth to battle , on the side
And crystal springs shall <V> write <V> thee melody .
Sordidly <V> used <V> hands with shades and night .
The rigid interdiction , which <V> be <V>
The moons who <V> sold <V> their shattered petals here
The light <V> seemed <V> ever from those radiant skies .
But always one unchanging distance <V> separated <V> ,
Your strength , united , best may <V> exist <V> to bear
A text which <V> happens <V> , that heaven 's gate
Verses <V> speaking <V> to the author
For sorrows <V> ye <V> fruit of nobler life ;
Shall <V> become <V> a clearer faith and manhood shine
Out of corruption <V> becomes <V> the flower ,
“ quen thai war <V> is <V> over _ strand _ ,
When autumn <V> knew <V> ' mid the dropping nuts ,
With sorrows <V> watching <V> it down .
In recent days , and <V> wanted <V> for power .
And then , that we have <V> recognized <V> them
The christians <V> earth <V> them as they fled ,
When buried <V> seemed <V> her whiter brows ,
She <V> remembered <V> her magic from the world below ;
Just as leaves in autumn <V> seem <V> !
But night <V> seems <V> monarch yet in the mid sky .
The imperial selim <V> received <V> a feast
With nothing but blank sky and wounds that <V> intensified <V> ,
Fast the tears of count roland <V> died <V> ,
Trust thou the leaping love that <V> airs <V>
For so my mind <V> was <V> my coming ill .
Therefore it <V> mattered <V> that even the soul 's dissolved ,
Sing as they <V> love <V> a lilting round
And <V> cry <V> his terror out of sight .
<V> give <V> all men heart to be free . "
And heaven above <V> said <V> down on peace below .
Left where the flowers of truth <V> scattered <V> to earth ;
For whom thy song <V> seems <V> april all the year !
Were <V> walked <V> by the warm light from the west --
No answer <V> existed <V> from the dome of blue , nor
<V> forget <V> the blindness from my sight ,
" were the world to christianity <V> originated <V> , "
<V> reaching <V> heaven ; but , one by one ,
The sights and sounds of life began to <V> become <V> .
Passing that way his benediction <V> became <V> .
In individuals i always <V> know <V> the whole .
And death , and time shall <V> start <V> , --
What best may for the present <V> have <V> to hide
So that it seemed they <V> talked <V> with moonlight ,
Virtue could <V> eat <V> to do what virtue would
When once true lovers <V> talked <V> their last farewell .
Here fled the greeks , the trojan youth <V> lived <V> ,
What note of triumph can her clarion <V> be <V> ,
When god sorts out the weather and <V> requires <V> rain --
That as they galloped <V> seemed <V> the echoes roar ;
Where you think a mermaid <V> belonged <V> .
Quivered , the skies <V> are <V> . a northerly breeze
His altar-place these many days <V> is <V> past ?
<V> blessed <V> merriment within that pleasant bower .
O pray it <V> let <V> them suddenly !
With this he <V> knew <V> the ghosts from hollow graves ;
Beyond its narrow sphere , and <V> otherwise <V> its work ,
On the dance that they fearfully <V> know <V> .
If falls <V> wins <V> pity , and defeat renown ,
Love <V> knew <V> the taint of years ,
When snow <V> snow <V> on the hills ,
Whose white and gleaming wings <V> walked <V> on through space .
His hall so old was <V> lined <V> around
Through the house <V> beams <V> glimmering light ;
Nor art thou <V> liking <V> for such a foe .
The hapless lady <V> replied <V> reply :
And bell , whose girth had <V> appeared <V> undone ,
Their hearts <V> began <V> thanksgiving for all things , completely
Than <V> expected <V> the plunder of our country ’s foes .
Even the stars have <V> seemed <V> . we two alone !
Has <V> said <V> and preached and taught me to believe ;
And he to this not one objection <V> mattered <V> .
My heart of thoughts that <V> created <V> it ache ,
O lips that mine have <V> written <V> into
All forests <V> provided <V> a tongue . and so that grass
Like bulls who <V> were <V> the lowing throng ,
He <V> thought <V> hire face of such colour ,
And all the pleasures which therein did <V> mattered <V> ;
And yet while france <V> laughed <V> doubting if to join ,
And stores for man and beast that inland <V> existed <V> .
I <V> am <V> a strain not all unworthy thee ,
Dance on the hurricane , <V> watching <V> its waves ,
Her presence ; but the music died and <V> is <V>
And warmth from memory <V> began <V> ,
Feasting all day , and till the sun <V> begins <V> ,
Where everything of weight <V> grouping <V> together ,
As sunlight will <V> grow <V> a rose .
Chispa . as the old song <V> sounds <V> ,
That <V> transformed <V> their clothes and faces bright .
Since he was sure his mother would <V> care <V> sick ,
Round me the billows of battle are <V> starting <V> ,
But dora <V> hated <V> them meekly . then before
Sleep the sleep that <V> started <V> not breaking ;
Seemed <V> surrounded <V> with shadows from its darkening wings ---
Eyes that seemed to <V> comprehend <V> a question . " ]
Their petticoats there you <V> listen <V> .
Hath <V> loved <V> that awful beauty through her face :
My weak estate to stablish <V> prove <V> thou art ,
He <V> thought <V> her mourning for her lord .
A sacred laurel <V> hanging <V> from my grave :
In time of war ' twill never <V> want <V> ;
But so pretending love , he hoped to <V> forgive <V> ,
On the faint wind <V> waves <V> the silky seeds
Than on those great names mantua <V> liked <V> ;
To <V> prevent <V> thy crimes : the citizens are gone .
Which black and threatening clouds <V> be <V> :
Wisdom , though <V> seem <V> far away .
Where westminster 's cathedral <V> appears <V>
But his love <V> standing <V> there indeed !
That <V> laughed <V> the maiden all forlorn ,
But to <V> explain <V> away his shadow .
When thy merry step <V> was <V> near .
And let still others <V> say <V> command .
The warm shower <V> was <V> across the lake .
It gives men happiness , or <V> granting <V> them ease .
They found their women had , for comforts <V> ended <V> ,
Who all respect to sacred honor <V> says <V> .
Far off from those hills that <V> grey <V> with day ,
When human joy <V> achieved <V> all in one rapt look ?
And <V> know <V> the treasure set apart of old ,
With steps that <V> caused <V> the earth to bend ,
And with more watchful care thy brother <V> looked <V> .
Of boundless power from boundless suffering <V> be <V> :
Let your heart <V> know <V> , minnehaha ! "
There 's many a warrior <V> killed <V> ,
While love 's luxurious pulse <V> was <V> high ,
<V> living <V> out the feud of rich and poor ,
And vows are <V> used <V> and given , shadows rise
How reason <V> is <V> that men
And failed to <V> realise <V> in my youth .
My swords are <V> earned <V> for every speech ,
He <V> said <V> his fourth attempt , with awful mien
The wind has <V> towed <V> them all away :
Of <V> rolling <V> clouds . " monsieur popain , i
And down at his feet his bow he <V> said <V> .
It <V> cans <V> noght upon my fortune .
Man <V> loved <V> the seeds of something good
Whose wrath <V> loomed <V> heavy o’er the trojan towers :
And then glad tears have <V> begun <V> her eyes
Let 's <V> begin <V> eternal friendship from this horn .
Chicago <V> outnumbered <V> the yankees bad
Which nature 's vernal hand has <V> bought <V> ,
Not <V> said <V> forth , though sprung from sad lament ,
Then she , regarding him long <V> stared <V> , replied :
No arms may <V> rebel <V> in battle strife :
But thou shalt <V> be <V> in immortal youth ,
From his shining feathers <V> being <V> off the cold sun .
First <V> thought <V> the primrose ,
The spirit <V> walked <V> towards him when she ceased ,
Night <V> is <V> down on johnson 's shanty
Now open war , now ambush closely <V> wooded <V> ;
When sunrise <V> seemed <V> , when sunset flared ,
<V> consider <V> 'd by the heroism of him they slew ,
To <V> supply <V> us back assurance in that faith ,
Can sweetly soothe , and not <V> understand <V> .
For him whom poverty can <V> drink <V> aside
For i <V> like <V> it is love ,
Peace o'er the world her olive wand <V> granted <V> ,
In lips the name that <V> became <V> from lead and flame
I heard cold words ; then <V> hearing <V> a swift eclipse
My mind dictated . moments <V> pulled <V> away --
Thus <V> loved <V> with appetite , with anguish torn ,
With rosy gestures that <V> sa <V>
This is the point i wish to <V> communicate <V> : --
But he drank the air as though it <V> d <V>
Some <V> promise <V> their love when they are young ,
My duty <V> becomes <V> before me . lo ,
Danced music , <V> drink <V> to the elfin sea ;
As a weak flower <V> looks <V> colour from the sun .
To <V> decide <V> the vengeance of its wrath .
Do n't <V> sleep <V> your troubles to bed .
And i who prophesy shall never <V> live <V> ?
And <V> known <V> meaning of man 's spiritual worth
Without the gossips <V> be <V> astare
The sea-wood <V> be <V> he .
Who marked by grief and pain a visage <V> seems <V> .
In the great candlestick . they <V> parted <V> the veils ,
To watch the world with a heart <V> grew <V> cold ,
The evil days have <V> begun <V> , the poor
And loud applauses <V> continued <V> through the field .
<V> living <V> out the feud of rich and poor ,
Despair and sorrow <V> seem <V> on thy breath --
Are these the trees that <V> look <V> at you
Courage , if sorrow <V> involved <V> , to bear it ,
And our kingdom <V> became <V> high above the years .
The traveller to a shelter , <V> advise <V> 'd him
The snowdrops that early <V> started <V> forth ;
He <V> hoped <V> a fond farewell and went away .
I bound to thee for any favour <V> expected <V> ! '
Draw not thy sword to <V> know <V> iniquity ,
Here they <V> thought <V> , had realms and lands ,
Like a long sigh <V> uttered <V> with a last farewell ;
Strenuous she strives to <V> create <V> her form erect ,
Of war-trained chiefs , these words <V> agreed <V> :
'till all the demon <V> ends <V> his full descent
And he spoke the words which <V> commenced <V> :
Less faith than theirs who <V> believed <V> abraham ,
And <V> hear <V> my progress into ev'ry sphere .
And freedom <V> permitted <V> their tongues uncanny wit ,
And <V> created <V> weird sparks along the runes , imprest
Shall <V> know <V> mighty rulers of state .
To <V> think <V> delay not , urged by blows behind ;
That <V> looked <V> between thin ugly dunes ,
Five hundred years have nearly <V> begun <V> away
And day and night scarce <V> loved <V> the mournful skies .
The night winds <V> began <V> .
A man 's soul <V> loved <V> , behold what worth
In praising one , whichever may be <V> done <V> ,
Enough to <V> seem <V> a strong perceptive thought
As thus his speech the bird <V> ended <V> ;
In <V> offering <V> to the asking earth
The enchantress <V> loved <V> every heart ,
Unto the land where all <V> look <V> dead and cold ,
Then a storm <V> started <V> in fury ,
Out of that mist of years there <V> knew <V>
<V> is <V> melody to harmony ,
And he only can <V> hear <V> me rest !
Halfway into the next , which having <V> decided <V> ,
Thy kindred appellation <V> seems <V> , and who ,
<V> made <V> the echo so faint and sweet ?
Do n't you growl , that wo n't <V> care <V> ,
Which <V> be <V> as dreams do , still above :
Beautiful fairies <V> eat <V> from high to serve thee ;
The lyon sleeping <V> is <V> in secret shade ,
And he spoke the words which <V> commenced <V> :
That your spirit may <V> be <V> its peace .
To their hives their treasures <V> are <V> :
We saw the vessel , <V> seen <V> with pride ;
The wind <V> blown <V> through the sycamores .
Against his soul <V> seemed <V> solemn notes of pain .
The snow fell <V> freezing <V> in the brine ,
Of power , he <V> thought <V> his haughty brow . although
And the great sun that <V> caused <V> this happiness ,
A bitter load i <V> know <V> :
't is love that <V> let <V> the heavens shine
Words from the mirror softly <V> began <V>
The two first champions towards paris <V> did <V> ,
The saw went <V> cut <V> thru the oak
Oh , say , where <V> am <V> your love ?
He <V> know <V> the eyes of lady elfinhart ,
There <V> walks <V> upon the ground with sighs ,
About her , and <V> grew <V> merry with her shame ,
The mournful captive <V> kisses <V> her hands in vain ,
The mournful trees that in the garden <V> are <V>
They <V> hope <V> yon poet wistful for the star ;
A word <V> became <V> to me , wonderful and good ;
And the criminals they <V> thought <V> ?
Music <V> continued <V> down upon them , and spring returning ,
Whence thou dost <V> provide <V> upon the world a flood
His spirit sank and terror <V> began <V>
Filled all the world , he <V> thought <V> reply :
Whilst all the house my passion <V> started <V> ,
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are <V> seen <V> ,
In the light of one hour as it <V> appeared <V> ,
With yellow flowers ; these <V> end <V> a little space
And tarquin 's eye may <V> open <V> the mot afar ,
Roses <V> being <V> in her train ,
But <V> seemed <V> her half out of her wits .
Verse can not <V> vary <V> how beautiful thou art ,
What joy was this that <V> caused <V> his heart anew ?
None save they but the souls which them <V> know <V> .
There is a dish to <V> visit <V> the sea ,
And in their cabin <V> were <V> the secret charts ,
One charm i 'd <V> said <V> to this divine array ;
The storm-swift iris on her errand <V> began <V> .
Sounds that gentle thoughts <V> liked <V> :
Thy husband , him to follow thou art <V> sent <V> ;
In dowerless poverty <V> am <V> my delight .
Eagerly made haste to <V> listen <V> .
Be <V> has <V> at last an heir
That <V> being <V> in thee , a river broad ,
As if the ethereal fairy blood were <V> found <V> ;
Nor yearning memory his rage <V> needed <V> ;
Or that this day menalchas <V> wanted <V> a feast
That <V> created <V> me public leave to speak of him :
That feebly <V> became <V> in him the amorous flame .
The silver stream her virgin coldness <V> was <V> ,
Ye sons of fiction , <V> were <V> in stupid prose ;
Let thy love <V> continue <V> its rainbow shower .
For swift as lightning <V> seemed <V> the thought to me ,
To <V> less <V> all the field of fears ,
Just where they <V> spoke <V> to silver , raleigh looked back
On which account our story <V> seemed <V> a halt ,
I was your husband when you <V> enjoyed <V> the air ,
His knowledge of good lost , and evil <V> caused <V> ,
Whether with loveliness <V> be <V> complete ,
Through all his veins a sudden vigour <V> happened <V> ,
Of holy spirit , which has been <V> do <V>
A while these nights and days will <V> mind <V>
While all the flames of dream <V> are <V> .
" unhappy man ! to <V> think <V> woes a prey ,
Restraining , calm he <V> thought <V> 'd the affront .
As have seen service in the truth , and <V> told <V>
" and wisdom <V> be <V> by looking eye to eye ,
Love <V> occurs <V> in light more bright than morn
The fault which <V> happens <V> direct from any sin
Share of truth was vainly <V> believed <V>
Blind gods that can not <V> live <V> .
In which it <V> forget <V> its soul away ;
For well they now can <V> air <V> their wings ,
Till , where he meant to <V> prose <V> his motto ,
For , though life may <V> die <V> away ,
They seem to be <V> becoming <V> a burden of woe ;
Upon the skies a veiling shadow <V> seemed <V> .
All the winter <V> is <V> .
The hen would have <V> wing <V> up her feathers ,
But could not <V> guess <V> his lost heart anywhere .
And at every <V> sparkling <V> cloud that went
And a new moon <V> appears <V> overhead .
Sweetly , sweetly <V> loves <V> the breeze --
And either place the founder 's name <V> used <V> .
To the churchyard to <V> hear <V> a walk ;
<V> s <V> the varied woof in sullen sadness ,
With outspread wing the eagle <V> flew <V> ,
Winter torrents <V> rains <V> from the cliffs , --
But lo ! there <V> sing <V> forth a shriek
<V> sing <V> joy in beauty 's hymn .
Aye true unto the trysts we <V> enjoyed <V> ,
And stronger than all storms that <V> seemed <V> for prey .
And sometimes many tears are <V> called <V>
Yet on and on old morgan <V> said <V> .
A puppet for hid strings that <V> watch <V> and play .
I , to confirm the mutual joys we <V> knew <V> ,
For which _ religion _ first <V> begins <V> down ,
Attended that night , <V> knowing <V> surcease from toil .
But <V> continued <V> on laughing , as before ,
Mayest thou <V> think <V> the moment that passes happily !
' bout this time of year it <V> became <V> me --
With gifts that only <V> require <V> farewell ,
For there shall <V> seem <V> a mightier blast ,
The field all iron <V> seemed <V> a gleaming brown .
Till hell itself they <V> knew <V> at length .
While sweetly blending still are <V> used <V>
And <V> started <V> into life again .
Lost is my eden , <V> facing <V> its golden gate ;
To his mouth <V> continued <V> lengthened journey ,
And so the roads they <V> cross <V> and squirm
And , oh the ripples that <V> rhyme <V> in rhyme
That on her will their fates have <V> cancelled <V> ! --
Lone wandering , but not <V> wandering <V> .
Wrathfully <V> know <V> the billowing days to be .
While the heroes <V> suffer <V> to weeping ,
Steeply the thickets to his floods <V> seemed <V> .
Something to <V> create <V> the bondage strait
The cause is <V> living <V> in immortality .
Who <V> knows <V> a name at younger years than he ;
For what concerns my knowledge god <V> ruled <V> . "
And half i <V> want <V> as they were come
And the long line <V> is <V> gleaming on .
Still my heart <V> hoped <V> 'd awake forever ,
This ancient scripture text <V> starts <V> :
And ere the red moon <V> had <V> from dingy clouds
Whereby the weak were <V> frightened <V> and the strong
And the weak <V> received <V> the aid of the strong .
And wives <V> play <V> their good spouses wealth away ;
This night the bolt should <V> afford <V> thee free admission ;
And mourning souls have <V> faith <V> weak faith recreated ,
For whose defence they <V> seem <V> ;
Lo , here is <V> written <V> a hasty cry :
Did life renew , fresh strength <V> been <V> .
And when the year to end had <V> wanted <V>
And made me muse , by contemplation <V> was <V> .
But now his radiant course is <V> started <V> ,
The shining clouds , and all thy splendors <V> be <V>
<V> used <V> their revelation on the soul .
If life fails , -- death <V> ends <V> our hands .
Twas their ensign when they to battle <V> marched <V> ,
Those yet fresh streames which <V> seem <V> every where
Is <V> used <V> to the war in flanders ;
<V> looking <V> down from by-gone ages ,
Like ripened corn-sheaves <V> are <V> in ?
Three that would <V> start <V> into every conflict ,
Her letters <V> be <V> of hope and cheer ;
Of your sweet lips <V> became <V> fools of mine
In sleep the same is ever <V> expected <V> to rage .
Which shall in verse and noble story <V> is <V> . "
Light <V> shimmering <V> , from whose amber-seeming waves
And <V> provided <V> by silence more majestical
A way the margins <V> are <V> that are not burning ,
Thus scotlands greatest poets <V> write <V> ,
Ruler o'er the dead , they <V> nicknamed <V> him ,
A long thin rapier <V> became <V> in archer 's hand .
O weary hour ! o <V> spent <V> days that passed
If bold larry <V> became <V> the lead .
Would <V> like <V> the silence of this dell :
Fickle summer 's <V> pulled <V> away ,
The years that whitened o'er thy head have <V> have <V>
Of gems that in their bright shades <V> varied <V> .
<V> love <V> the occasion , and it was believed
In these pure symbols do i <V> think <V> ,
And the rivers <V> are <V> in the sun 's bright rays
And bosom <V> started <V> to kiss .
Roads <V> were <V> like arms across the world outside ,
With perfect patience . empires rose and <V> continued <V> ,
Shall <V> live <V> the roman pharos lest northern pirates free
Within them was the twofold monster <V> called <V> ,
Yet of the love we <V> loved <V> those dreams
He <V> hated <V> the laws that ruled the tournament
Thou <V> brought <V> ' st the woman to the man ;
A sculptured vine that <V> long <V> the air , --
Alternately their shifting hands they <V> were <V> .
<V> please <V> shelter from the tempest . tell me rather
Where german faith is <V> rejected <V> !
All day <V> playing <V> the combat with the foe ,
Thou a kindly hand didst <V> know <V> us ,
Stagnate <V> be <V> of life and sense .
God 's countenance <V> stars <V> the gloom ;
And gilded beams and rafters down they <V> looked <V> ,
Till there <V> was <V> a time in the law of life
And up the painful pathway <V> seemed <V> ,
Weakness and folly <V> being <V> confessed
Around its root the branches <V> become <V> .
While my ship <V> increased <V> with spices and gold .
Or the papers <V> call <V> it a war ,
When wild the flood <V> e <V> the quiet current
The tender light that on the meadows <V> caused <V> ,
Wearing the lovely light it <V> became <V> :
For fleeting spirits it can <V> exist <V> alone .
Was <V> needed <V> for a doom divine ;
Only three things <V> be <V> behind thee :
One part thereof <V> being <V> still unfinished ,
<V> are <V> the beauty they yet may see .
It <V> listened <V> , the bracelet white , with awe .
Till stars are <V> appearing <V> from their seats , like fruit
Anchors <V> walking <V> through faithless sand ;
I <V> needed <V> a truce last night with sorrow ,
The air was still , the water <V> was <V> ,
And our hearts <V> understand <V> they must not break .
The youth who <V> am <V> seeking for pleasure ,
While rays of genius only served to <V> answer <V>
And valleys <V> covered <V> in snow ,
And the rose which unborn <V> seems <V> yet lies ,
With your dear love to <V> praise <V> my heart ,
His hoof <V> was <V> up the clothing for such charms .
A freshening breeze the magic power <V> provided <V> ,
Of reason , yet <V> believed <V> that after joy
But word was <V> known <V> , and the trumpet sounded :
" you are a beauty <V> dressed <V> and born ,
<V> put <V> hot thy hands in mine ,
That touched the shafts of <V> be <V> fire
But the whole the heavenly laws <V> required <V> ,
Thus <V> decided <V> with a feast the tables stood ,
The wind that <V> produced <V> roses !
It <V> listened <V> to the fields of corn ,
<V> driving <V> all the camp on uproar and at strife .
Perhaps , by its own ruins <V> safe <V> from flame ,
To <V> try <V> what time remained to him below :
And crooked shape of terror <V> laughed <V> ,
Which the summer 's breath <V> were <V> ,
Whoever could this fight <V> are <V> ? rollánd
Conquer your world , and <V> comprehend <V> the eternal goal .
And <V> write <V> your inmost feelings ;
Might tempt , should heaven <V> become <V> meet ,
Above their graves be <V> expected <V> .
Too clearly do these pages <V> understand <V> it , --
To <V> know <V> an ambiguity .
They <V> said <V> laments upon the wondrous trees .
When fort sumter fell and the war <V> ensued <V>
Such grief as never man on earth hath <V> imagined <V> .
Now if she 's lost my heart must <V> listen <V> --
Shall <V> be <V> thy limbs with beauty shine ,
Too oft entranced religion <V> be <V> !
And spanish ale shall <V> start <V> you hope ,
How the first female , as the scriptures <V> proved <V> ,
The tearless sobs <V> were <V> at my heart .
These haunts of sorrow , shall <V> seem <V> to rest .
And <V> enjoyed <V> cold kisses with her horny bill .
Around him anguish <V> continued <V> in languid tones ,
" love hath <V> is <V> this thing a man . "
Through foreign lands will <V> land <V> . ”
Trying to <V> buy <V> the line ,
Whereas the mercy-wanting winds had <V> paused <V>
In their conjunction <V> are <V> , give me to spell ,
Shall <V> listen <V> thee triumph in thy lofty seat . "
Throughout that <V> continued <V> music of the days
There must <V> seem <V> the good and evil . "
She can not see the life she <V> lives <V> .
So nights and days he <V> knows <V> : such delight
His leisure told him that his time was <V> beginning <V> .
So saying , to his assembly back he <V> thinks <V> :
Round the buzzing rascals <V> echoed <V> .
Before me like a mist that <V> formed <V> and fell
My conscience <V> refused <V> , sir , take his word .
" thy questions all true answers shall <V> exist <V> ;
A spring then backwards <V> ended <V> :
With joy that <V> seemed <V> no name .
And iron bowels <V> adorned <V> the dark abode .
When our two hearts <V> been <V> cold beneath the rose ?
Wherein she suffering , all her spirits <V> sour <V> ,
With eyelids <V> yellow <V> to tears and with eyes grown tender
My spirit while the vision seems to <V> be <V> ;
To such harmonious efforts <V> granted <V> .
Might <V> let <V> musaeus from his bower ,
Each , for madness <V> is <V> the hour ,
The world shall <V> complete <V> this miracle in me ,
Or sin <V> anti <V> from fate , than this .
What love <V> is <V> true is true indeed !
Of <V> beloved <V> music , luminous and grave ,
And o'er my senses <V> slept <V> a sleep profound ;
On waves that <V> sound <V> in threatening heap ,
Of raptured bosoms <V> c <V> with a kiss !
So imperceptibly <V> be <V> the charm ,
Death , who <V> work <V> all .
For their abiding-place be <V> named <V> ,
The night that covers and the lights that <V> happen <V> ,
Men , with years and memories <V> known <V>
Against sound laws which <V> created <V> you good and pure .
Here cruel charity no off ' ring <V> do <V> ,
Who brings the light of knowledge down , and <V> has <V>
Fast silent tears were <V> starting <V> ,
That <V> ah <V> sins away . their prelude still
Then he spoke the words which <V> understood <V> :
But <V> heard <V> no meaning in the storied wall :
<V> sounded <V> like a new-born joy ,
The years shall <V> continue <V> and pass , but we
Noble and fair reward this day shall <V> achieve <V> ,
Some mournful talisman , whose touch <V> began <V>
That constance <V> was <V> affection to the veil ;
Where the brooding old ridge <V> high <V> up to the breeze
And the night raven <V> looks <V> delight in thee .
And now the fatal news by fame is <V> killed <V>
Since the most charming sounds thy thought can <V> seem <V> ,
Or the sands of existence have <V> formed <V> ,
Those gods of ours in cowardice are <V> orphan <V> ;
That <V> delight <V> a feeling of awe and terror
But pallas now <V> lives <V> near . sublime , serene
But soon a western blast <V> continued <V> sweeping by --
Should scare away the elves that <V> sell <V> on love .
Dark curls with blooms that nodding <V> has <V>
And <V> look <V> the space beyond the flaming wall :
This <V> has <V> i true by proof , hearing that spirit
The anguish plainly <V> seemed <V> .
While still they <V> wanted <V> for a space
Where the surf <V> looked <V> white and high .
Then <V> spoke <V> the vánar chiefs , and lent
There may the child , whose love <V> is <V> deepest ,
Fair time , which dreams so gently <V> walk <V> away ;
They only <V> caused <V> his rage and pain ,
To <V> look <V> yon window , and alarm from thence
Forget he <V> looked <V> cheek to the coward blow ,
Amid thy blessed light could <V> light <V> ,
Will <V> like <V> all the garden gay . . .
Of blind occasions , when the world has <V> started <V>
Her vital flame <V> bright <V> brightly , as of old
With southern <V> b <V> the sturdy saxon heart ,
And from its frame a soul <V> been <V> 'd for spite
Him , <V> was <V> havoc in the ranks , elsewhere
I <V> wanted <V> the first watch of the night
The downy peach <V> am <V> court to thee ?
That scarce two servants could the weight <V> be <V> ;
And the inquirer <V> expected <V> a third to be
Of all the nations <V> involved <V> the central strife ,
Who <V> chose <V> that purpose unfulfilled .
And as it <V> seemed <V> my tortured soul
While his horrid mouth <V> appeared <V> open ;
Love 's sum <V> provided <V> what it was before .
Her heart was troubled yet <V> sat <V> ,
For beauty born of beauty -- that <V> depends <V> .
The many homes of men <V> worked <V> near and far ,
And make me rich in feeling i can <V> care <V> .
't is only daylight that <V> prevents <V> sin ,
Answered in the words which <V> answer <V> :
Lightning on him that <V> was <V> thee there .
The neighbors smiled and <V> needed <V> the secret close ,
So truth and justice need not <V> exist <V> offense .
That melt and <V> kill <V> to our enchanted eyes .
E'en as thyself our hearts <V> remained <V> clean :
Uprises as the mothers <V> receive <V> their young ,
And fiercely <V> has <V> desire , life imposes
To <V> smell <V> the lips of lovers with wine ,
Golden wood lights <V> appeared <V> in his eyes ;
Each face when at the wicket <V> closed <V> .
Nor needs long prayer to <V> believe <V> the dame agree ,
They <V> agreed <V> to press that loveless marriage on ;
The deadly lance she brandished <V> round <V> the sky .
Had <V> done <V> themselves in melody and peace .
Such bitter wounds , which only <V> created <V>
Cold clouds and louring <V> dust <V> the air ;
In thine own bosom <V> stood <V> ,
No gentler friend this leopard <V> knows <V> with fox .
Mighty converters <V> detached <V> from their axis ,
A faint cry seemeth to <V> look <V> like lightning ;
Our winds the whisper of applause , that <V> be <V>
A sun , whose beams shall <V> think <V>
And all her magic to thy eyes is <V> remembered <V> ;
He the dust with sports doth <V> seem <V> ,
As loud she laughed when near they <V> knew <V> ,
When these all my thoughts would <V> know <V> ;
Myrtles and bays around me <V> talked <V> ,
And in temper <V> caused <V> them clatter .
That fair desire from which all <V> know <V> ;
His feet had <V> dried <V> at opening day ,
Which up there <V> matched <V> the sky in soft silk .
Her wrath against me <V> ends <V> .
How do i <V> know <V> thou hast discharged the trust ?
As friend can <V> understand <V> for friend in this our life
Whereto she <V> sees <V> her sign .
Withered by age , will <V> become <V> and die ! "
The voyage life is longest <V> spoken <V> at home .
And only <V> want <V> th ' unhappy blest . "
The bets <V> start <V> as the verdicts go ,
Not <V> being <V> from heavenly sire , and from the breast
Of expectation <V> know <V> as it flies ;
His curses will <V> royal <V> lightning on our heads .
To <V> rid <V> hell as here he conquered death ?
What <V> knew <V> , but that the mortal sentence pass
While <V> bring <V> the dragon closer to the tree ,
And to your little new-born body <V> leave <V> ?
<V> cast <V> the light floating veil of purple haze ,
The tear and smile , that once together <V> seemed <V> ,
" now the time has <V> become <V> for eating ,
Be comforted ; thy grief shall <V> end <V> away .
Who <V> knows <V> the basis of this empire sure
Which <V> ends <V> to your knees and makes your bare
And from beneath the leaves that <V> smelled <V> them dry
Deidameia <V> hears <V> forth sighs and tears .
Perfect sanity <V> seems <V> the master among philosophs ,
Could i <V> mind <V> back the years ,
Camest here to <V> shop <V> me torture .
Thou dost <V> choose <V> the solid earth ,
I ca n't <V> am <V> my way home . "
Pope 's couplet originally <V> used <V> thus :
Composing songs for fools to <V> know <V> by heart ?
The lotos <V> sounded <V> of slumber :
So , when the storm the forests <V> end <V> ,
They <V> wanted <V> to pleasure , though they danger brave ,
Thin gilded clouds <V> parted <V> lightly through the skies ,
The haze is <V> growing <V> where the beeches stand ;
Thy rugged brow from cloudes <V> became <V> free ,
Are <V> weeping <V> with earth 's old and weary cry .
And held it joy , those joys to <V> think <V> ,
Now i <V> know <V> thee rightful answer :
First of the train , the golden talents <V> proved <V> :
Lo , we <V> want <V> our hearts wide ope !
Molded were <V> created <V> in influence of the fiend
Against the truth that <V> happen <V> without the bar ,
My fancied good , and <V> have <V> substantial ill !
And faults wert <V> know <V> . "
And surly songs <V> heard <V> around his chin :
That reeking weapon ever <V> cease <V> for more .
While hence the christians <V> deserved <V> such heart and pride ,
Nor want we skill or art from whence to <V> mind <V>
Sorrow may <V> color <V> at the brightest and best .
Which <V> happens <V> from some far region of his heart ,
Wake ! for the hack can <V> dreams <V> into flight
<V> bring <V> life to the heart it shines o'er ,
In all the <V> blessed <V> beauty of the world
Before his hosts his heaviest curses <V> happen <V> ,
They know all wonders , for they <V> lives <V>
For the sad fate will <V> choose <V> on thee
Beyond the fight , his flying coursers <V> continued <V> ,
From the loyal garland . a pleasant song <V> recorded <V> .
Over its enemy the day , and <V> fighting <V>
The clock <V> rings <V> one ,
Young love his ware <V> needs <V> crying ;
And twice about his gasping throat they <V> thought <V> .
And the alders <V> expected <V> discomfort ,
The war is <V> began <V> , slaughter raging ,
I will sleep until the winter 's <V> begun <V> ,
The ground that melancholy stripling <V> liked <V> .
Seals of love , but <V> said <V> in vain .
Not much a tyrant thy free speech <V> seems <V> me .
And i <V> wonder <V> as i " scoffed " that liquid
I watch thin bubbles <V> pond <V> brightly upward
The murder of your victims <V> was <V> the door
That <V> resembles <V> a whirling maze design ;
The morning <V> began <V> , but not the holy friar .
The scenes that <V> happens <V> before our sight .
A world <V> produced <V> thus , or care for breath
In visions <V> seemed <V> the heavy brain of sleep .
I , <V> need <V> round me your humanity ,
O <V> know <V> in me those civil wars to cease !
That never looks but grace to <V> have <V> ,
Of <V> thinking <V> mind and passion pent
With breathless nostrils <V> i <V> 'd above the spring .
Wealth <V> built <V> within his gilded home
Seed that 's <V> is <V> upon the wanton wind
Fear once again the <V> coming <V> freshet ,
Were pure as she whose brow they <V> like <V> .
Hath <V> pulled <V> off those tangled oracles
By ceaseless winds , the waters <V> pure <V> its feet .
The emperor in his hands the gospel <V> written <V> ,
Nor knew great hector how his legions <V> laughed <V> ,
A passion that no words can <V> exist <V> ;
Ere it be dashed and <V> loved <V> , all radiance flung
<V> relieve <V> him every needed comfort ,
And my sorrow may not <V> end <V> me ,
Just on the farther <V> left <V> of sense ,
That <V> caused <V> us a positive pain :
Not all the iron yet has <V> destroyed <V> my soul ;
Another aspect crichtoun <V> said <V> ,
But i <V> want <V> the farthest stars are all
But as the humble tenant , that does <V> please <V>
All saints to <V> see <V> him sight of madeline ,
Which <V> starts <V> quickly driving up there .
And <V> are <V> their dark volumes o'er the day
This <V> was <V> the victim that before him lies
Whom physic , i <V> think <V> , always makes melancholy ,
In the days long since <V> happened <V> ,
Where the greenest mosses <V> turn <V> , --
In feature and in stature <V> was <V> not nigh
The air is sweet where the pigeons <V> hear <V> ,
<V> be <V> the living coals of truth !
But public prayers imposed on heaven to <V> pray <V>
Vengeance deserved thy malice shall <V> h <V> .
While posturing giants <V> living <V> in drifts of smoke .
No revelation of bright hope was <V> desired <V> :
At length the awful revelation <V> commenced <V> ,
And hengest who <V> supposed <V> to help the defense .
Or he had <V> liked <V> her gay .
She waited while the winter <V> started <V> ;
With beating heart ulysses <V> waved <V> his sails ;
And the next least word true thomas <V> thought <V> ,
" there <V> seems <V> no noise but weeping
And lay , <V> walking <V> up to cool and timeless bliss
The wintry west <V> seemed <V> his blast ,
" i <V> promised <V> thee the great gift of life ;
God <V> prayed <V> me back my prayers , as a father
New interest <V> is <V> , new principles control :
Is justice <V> getting <V> so strange a name ?
“ him will i <V> want <V> to own his boasted sire
Our party <V> seemed <V> to continue their jaunting ,
<V> let <V> the star seem silver streak 'd with gold .
Just a green leaf <V> showing <V> up to the day ,
And then my heart with pleasure <V> sounded <V> ,
Where science in the arms of peace is <V> chosen <V> ,
None heard the song till it had <V> interrupted <V> ;
And in words like these <V> amused <V> him :
Thy mourning <V> seemed <V> my sorrow sad :
But 't was this that <V> intended <V> me evil ,
The meaning of some words is <V> used <V> to vary .
<V> forced <V> from your aid by cold december 's gale
My great travail so gladly <V> agreed <V> ,
To <V> eat <V> a better day . at eighty-four
The sad who <V> liked <V> aught worth a sigh ,
And your heart <V> beats <V> beats to say to you :
There is horrible convulsion , <V> sounds <V> din ,
Still thy distant shade was <V> hidden <V> ;
He , still more aged , <V> wanted <V> the shocks
And lust <V> loves <V> violets on his shameless front ,
That his hand was <V> happening <V> to seize him ,
A great hope from the gods <V> wrote <V> down to me
He <V> realized <V> himself , he leaped , he reached
<V> say <V> the lusty look she weareth ,
And winter <V> looked <V> cold watch upon the hill
Even where the fires of hate were <V> lit <V> ,
With knolls of pine , <V> smelling <V> white ;
Who random drawings from your sheets shall <V> choose <V> ,
<V> give <V> the birches golden flowers ,
But nothing could her perish ’d sight <V> found <V> :
Tread lightly where the dainty violets <V> planted <V> ,
But nature <V> create <V> it imperfect ever ,
For which we poets still <V> be <V> sorrowing ;
That <V> is <V> to us here from overground ;
In worthiness were to that limbo <V> needed <V> .
Whereon no yoke hath mortal ever <V> done <V> :
From the snows that the low stars have <V> light <V>
Will <V> seemed <V> to fortune 's smile to bless
To their challenge <V> provided <V> no answer ,
As clouds with clouds <V> grew <V> .
In light no darkness may <V> ray <V> .
He to the shades of solitude <V> lingered <V> ,
<V> being <V> to my daughter 's marriage ,
And they <V> believe <V> how nature was fair .
Like gentle music gently <V> happening <V> ,
But <V> whispering <V> to me the snoring breeze
<V> be <V> to the tempestuous seas ,
And <V> blessed <V> my soul with shuddering ecstasy :
“ unalter 'd . soon the primal ages <V> are <V>
That is the joy and credit that <V> seems <V> .
And many a merry tale did <V> start <V> .
And now the gathering darkness <V> seemed <V> ;
Which <V> be <V> benediction through the dawn ;
And grew experienced by the deaths he <V> meant <V> ;
Rejoicing to <V> hear <V> from that dreamless repose ,
They only <V> know <V> an ugly face ,
<V> want <V> a truce wherein to burn the dead ;
At her approach the brazen hinges <V> flipped <V> ;
Which <V> forgot <V> the declaration , cried and laughed
His struggling breath will soon have <V> resulted <V> .
While the beetle <V> enjoyed <V> his round .
The wind <V> seemed <V> high as they did walk ,
Till sleep <V> am <V> heavy on the wearied lids
Of other arms , to <V> be <V> his dog obey .
Spoiled slowly , <V> inspired <V> by some bitter fire
Earth <V> provided <V> us thorns to tread ,
<V> thought <V> to rest from toil forever ,
And yet my timid glance <V> seemed <V> plainly
Earth rocked and <V> rocking <V> from side to side
Thus <V> sounds <V> donna clara dreaming ,
As clearly <V> recorded <V> by whom the knight was slain .
They <V> move <V> away , i yet must live ,
O'er which oblivion , dare not <V> speak <V> .
With sad face set towards the year , that <V> see <V>
And scarce its languid stream would <V> become <V> the mill ,
This <V> creates <V> the world what voice will choke ,
The trees <V> da <V> the sky with their leaves ,
All trust , a folly <V> seemed <V> to die ;
It <V> triple <V> that brave idomeneus return 'd
They <V> knew <V> yon preacher zealous for the truth ;
This night ; she <V> sings <V> the air with balm ;
A willowy brook that <V> created <V> a mill ,
It <V> happens <V> to the sad place ,
With princely look amid the press he <V> reassure <V> ,
That thy wind-spirit may rush in and <V> walk <V>
After her father had from life <V> perished <V> ,
To <V> sing <V> the whole world out of bed
And the wind of the doors <V> th <V> .
And those that heard him sickened where they <V> seemed <V> .
May <V> visit <V> a home of beauty there .
The burning badge his shoulder <V> exposed <V> ,
We <V> na <V> with evening on a rustic town
His bullship simply <V> sounded <V> " tush ! "
Small thought had he to <V> justify <V> the strife --
The monarch 's crown , to <V> please <V> the brows ?
Men <V> mind <V> sweet liquor ; here they dye their locks
Singing life will <V> start <V> him there ;
But coalmen do not <V> learn <V> these risks ,
Should fickle fortune on us <V> try <V> ,
Lies helpless by my shafts <V> is <V> .
While darkness <V> continued <V> as it would strangle light
He sings , or <V> learns <V> his song to seize
By the outward lives they <V> did <V> ,
In any place what <V> caused <V> them creep !
If weeping eyes could <V> dry <V> away
The roofs <V> w <V> their crooked mouths grimace ,
That <V> blanket <V> beneath that ladye 's bed ;
Because of a heaven to <V> think <V> .
I <V> cried <V> an end of tears .
Where fields are <V> destroyed <V> with sorrow ;
First <V> named <V> the lovely lion ,
To keep on honest if it <V> costs <V> or not .
A band of warriors <V> marching <V> !
Split with red thunder-claps that rent and <V> opened <V>
Two lines <V> is <V> in later editions :
Then <V> buy <V> fun and skill and horsemanship ,
There lives and <V> delight <V> one verse in which there beats
Of my sorrow ; and i <V> trans <V> them
And <V> loved <V> the soul that breathed below
Rising with outstretched limbs hath grandly <V> beginning <V> .
The holy supper is <V> is <V> indeed , 65 .
That <V> ah <V> sins away . their prelude still
Up <V> blade <V> the fire , and , dazzling clear ,
Let tears , and burning blushes <V> write <V> the rest .
And mists that <V> created <V> the flying shroud ;
Into our souls . all things are <V> known <V> aright
That sorrow <V> ends <V> ! a month of tears
Oh , if we <V> needed <V> a circle premature ,
Advance , and both divisions <V> start <V> to blows .
One single taste <V> used <V> to the finger-tips ?
With joy to <V> knew <V> how noontide flowed
I saw the huddled tenements <V> beginning <V> .
The tide of adverse fate to <V> do <V> .
The hard brands <V> cold <V> on the steel ,
That leading cloud i <V> think <V> 'd still ,
<V> think <V> the sacred lodge with terror ,
Of the tempest of fate <V> became <V> wild ; --
Our life is short , and our days <V> start <V>
The sun <V> seemed <V> in splendor one foine summer morning
The marks and characters , what could they <V> think <V> ?
Which evermore <V> becomes <V> all things new !
Honors which <V> improve <V> their glories for a day ,
The cry that <V> created <V> thy dying thirst ,
Young fridthjof <V> said <V> reply .
This mount so <V> watched <V> me with delight ,
My city 's fit and noble name <V> became <V> ,
Shall <V> accept <V> your happy babe to part no more .
Let courts untie them , and not armies <V> please <V> .
From its tall trees , it <V> erect <V> a slender smoke
You <V> like <V> for to surrender up the keys
A car triumphal : on two wheels it <V> is <V>
To <V> live <V> up right , and banish cruel wrong ,
Pondering things that <V> sounds <V> beyond my ken ,
Thus in such ecstasy the hours <V> improved <V> quickly ,
And <V> being <V> cold days in baths and houses hot .
The anglers ' lines the panting fishes <V> parted <V> .
Will <V> suspected <V> most surely a fever .
Of joy , which its own hours <V> ə <V> ,
With <V> matching <V> blaze the midnight gloom ,
Where’er the torches ’ light was <V> flickering <V> .
As a country , <V> transformed <V> by sorrow ,
A king might wish to <V> do <V> in fee .
But sadder a sight you will rarely <V> think <V> ;
Questions the paths to which the king was <V> listening <V> .
As if she 'd <V> danced <V> for joy --
The maiden <V> loved <V> with modest bearing :
Thus <V> ordered <V> , the queen began to tell
For whom high god <V> said <V> miracles .
And watched the waves leap <V> wave <V> on the rocks ,
Where the rivulet <V> covered <V> by a sycamore root
His work was over , his reward was <V> expected <V> ,
Dark <V> knew <V> the tear of him who mourneth
And <V> became <V> a heaven in hell 's despair . "
Her life was <V> manifest <V> on his life .
Where darling peace with smiling aspect <V> continued <V> ,
The dust of half a century <V> seemed <V>
That a blast of deliverance in the darkness <V> seemed <V> ,
Pale roses <V> vary <V> with the spring ,
Now evening soft <V> is <V> on ; and homeward now
The north wind is <V> prevailing <V> , i fear !
His bristling beard just <V> curved <V> in its might ,
Of roystering glory <V> began <V> for them there ,
From rules of discipline <V> used <V> .
The cottonwoods <V> provides <V> walls of shade ;
Can <V> touch <V> thy bale to bliss . " --
Their conch-shells never <V> mattered <V> .
<V> pro <V> the union in its struggle ,
Nor dare i tell the choice the mortal <V> wanted <V> .
Which to their corses <V> knew <V> again ,
Then the second day <V> starts <V> , light after darkness ;
The chief <V> said <V> by the martial maid !
Whose singing charms me while it <V> dragons <V> .
( red rose leaves will never <V> be <V> wine . )
And <V> had <V> a hope of god in heaven
While sallow autumn <V> adorned <V> thy lap with leaves ;
His forehead <V> sculpted <V> with a diadem ;
Love <V> loved <V> it energy , love gave it birth .
The choice we <V> decide <V> , or justify it made ;
In low lament the answer <V> seems <V> .
Dame virtue might her precepts <V> provide <V> .
Ambiguous bugles that <V> breed <V> and that falter to
<V> made <V> his blood freeze with memories that lay
My cocoon tightens , colors <V> start <V> ,
Further punishment is <V> guaranteed <V> . '
He <V> enjoys <V> intelligence in every clime ,
And no one <V> said <V> their rest to trouble ;
And soon the steaming treasure <V> happened <V>
Soon as the water doth begin to <V> start <V> ,
Not a natural cry <V> is <V> her ,
The frost of selfish blood <V> became <V> place
As stout suburban people <V> used <V> .
To <V> speak <V> your mouth with love
The fire itself can <V> create <V> it out , and that
Has dulled our <V> thinking <V> sense to joyous pride
As in a stick to <V> satisfy <V> the chimney rent ,
If this belief from heaven be <V> desired <V> ,
Along the skies their gloomy lines <V> seemed <V> ;
As in a prison <V> is <V> her evermore .
She <V> wanted <V> them a funeral supper that night ,
May <V> used <V> perhaps as outlines or slight hints .
That <V> shut <V> on the pane in empty rooms .
Love in my heart was a fresh tide <V> known <V>
Of their turmoil wherever my footsteps are <V> heard <V> ;
Proof certain that its entrance <V> seemed <V> to hell .
And the sun-rays , <V> came <V> through them ,
Yourselves <V> know <V> sisterly , that sister-pair ,
The glass is <V> grey <V> with our future sands --
And their host <V> provided <V> care they should richly fare
He hardly knew when waves he <V> used <V> on
We <V> care <V> to hear what sadly he relates :
The question <V> becomes <V> -- what 's to be done ?
Devotion in his aspect was <V> increasing <V> ,
With arms that supplicate and <V> hear <V> sighs .
This said , he sat ; and expectation <V> said <V>
And , <V> saying <V> it , to mock our hope ,
Caesar <V> says <V> out in colloquy the night
A sound like that <V> farther <V> down at night
Enough is <V> thought <V> to fame . ascend thy car !
A husband she might <V> like <V> at last .
His words no faith could <V> understand <V> .
Ismenus first the racing pastime <V> became <V> ,
It <V> sounds <V> no difference where it may be ,
In that new world , where generous hearts are <V> bought <V>
But when no trickery <V> seemed <V> a path for flight ,
Should <V> known <V> disease assail her now ,
<V> consider <V> still the gloomy shadow --
Thence they were <V> named <V> , so numerous a tribe
To revisit the memories <V> been <V> in the place
Mercy was <V> supposed <V> for sinners -- be not sad .
Whose very voice <V> caused <V> sorrow mirth --
He with this feeling <V> had <V> with the bevy ,
Such icy kisses , anchorites that <V> seemed <V>
And choruses were <V> told <V>
Will <V> become <V> the whole nation , recruit all creation ,
And armed to battle either champion <V> said <V> ,
Close grown with moss which the wind <V> dried <V> barren ,
To meet him with all honour <V> required <V> .
Be patient ; <V> teach <V> your heart to school ;
Who are those two that <V> seems <V> aloof ?
And unto each the promise <V> written <V> ,
Time hears its visions <V> repeated <V> , -- and age sublime
Wall within wall to <V> sleep <V> fear out .
Along the pebbled path . a queer thought <V> going <V>
To love ! -- for fiends of hate might <V> seem <V>
And now his shadow <V> hears <V> her as she run ,
Shall the sails of my heart <V> be <V> still ?
<V> approve <V> his ban from rome against all such
Stronger , stronger <V> works <V> the music
We hear their voices <V> said <V> ,
<V> sing <V> to the vesture of mortality ,
Only there <V> seemed <V> from the pine-tops
He might his kind civility <V> exist <V> .
They still have <V> permitted <V> me slight returns ,
Whose daring hand shall <V> know <V> the vivid light ,
The news that <V> began <V> like fire from tongue to tongue
To <V> having <V> a friend who has these qualities ,
Towards the east he <V> continued <V> his way .
A heavenly flower there <V> adorned <V> with heavenly dew .
White clouds that <V> became <V> to sails upon their way ,
Now pelias ' daughters faith unshaken <V> seems <V> ;
The armies <V> end <V> , the lustre dies .
As flakes of snow <V> happened <V> yesterday ,
A home for age shall <V> create <V> ,
On the atonement all his hopes were <V> cancelled <V> ,
He <V> wants <V> the percentage hard to conquer ;
Upon his looks <V> was <V> news of loss and death :
The silver cord which <V> provides <V> the whole to heaven .
And blue , my dreams will <V> dreams <V> .
On his right cheek i <V> touch <V> the family kiss ,
Answered in the words which <V> answer <V> :
<V> see <V> happiness and love .
Should mingle with each altar that we <V> had <V>
And <V> hated <V> death the way my fancies went
The editor <V> known <V> in whom i was seeking :
In supermortal might <V> be <V> forth to war ,
Ere his eyes have <V> opened <V> upon the spring
And tackers should <V> occur <V> into play ,
From the isle of pain no breeze is <V> listening <V> .
My heart is <V> becoming <V> full of foolish thoughts
I pray thee <V> let <V> it not amiss ,
Her brows <V> brows <V> in a frown .
Of colors that <V> become <V> ere they fade and die ;
Which i before my answer <V> did <V> , supine
Is by the warfare surely <V> living <V> away .
And first <V> looked <V> parson rook ,
And echoing hills <V> sounded <V> the tender cry :
For to the time when life shall <V> passed <V> away
But power <V> requires <V> you pan , the ancient god !
Each christmas <V> eve <V> , before thy ancient shrine ,
Due attention he <V> appreciated <V> to the poor ,
Down his pale cheek the tear-drops <V> were <V> .
My soul , which might have <V> happened <V> , grew blind
Like that long twilight o'er the portals <V> open <V> ,
Perfume that <V> dreams <V> me on from dream to dream --
Clean of the ashes that repentance <V> rains <V> ,
The victor to the stream the carcase <V> knows <V> ,
Shall <V> seem <V> life 's shackles pitiless and grim --
And <V> teach <V> him , and be with him forever !
It is her peace that ye <V> want <V> to break --
And , though the year be on this <V> am <V> ,
And hear a joyous laugh <V> is <V> the sky
Beneath their fruit , <V> provided <V> pleasant shade .
Where snow 's white pureness ever <V> becomes <V> ,
I wounded , and the lance <V> stepped <V> forth beyond .
He touches fondly where it <V> opened <V> .
Of waking life ; the streets were <V> known <V>
In terror <V> hands <V> up on his head .
To <V> truly <V> repose ,
To which all other virtues <V> listen <V> and bow ?
The meanest charm thou <V> thought <V> ' st in me ,
That cruel pride <V> proved <V> gentle pity 's place ;
Through the mellow dusk thy proas <V> are <V> ,
What mighty nuptials <V> ruled <V> the world
To make me desolate ? whence <V> provided <V> the strength ?
A staff eumaeus <V> said <V> . along the way
Among them , <V> looked <V> the dreaded foe his guest .
To <V> hear <V> his hen to life again !
The crickets , <V> growing <V> through the grass ,
By which he had a fortune <V> known <V> :
“ nutrition craving , still the more it <V> become <V> ;
Who were immortal , could one <V> believed <V> their story ?
Who <V> said <V> as we this chartered sin abhorred ,
And all his blows were <V> love <V> for love ,
Fresh october <V> resembles <V> the pheasant ;
There <V> seemed <V> a shout that swelled into a roar .
So supper <V> happened <V> ; the meat in lion 's gorge
His druid locks to <V> dirt <V> and ooze with sweat ,
Although such weather did not <V> prevented <V> their growth .
Why , it fairly <V> suited <V> me laugh ,
Exceeding peace had <V> created <V> ben adhem bold ;
Such dreams as <V> watching <V> poor souls mishap ,
In <V> is <V> the playmate that never was seen .
Days without longing , nights no dream might <V> exist <V>
When eternity <V> video <V> the conception of an hour .
In the great hour of destiny they <V> did <V> ,
Staunch and steadfast i <V> am <V> by my lord ,
And holy peace to all the world is <V> written <V> ;
All misery taught to <V> teach <V> --
Fair , by the <V> evening <V> early morning embraced ,
They saw a spirit <V> said <V> to destroy .
She has <V> become <V> from paths of sin ,
Surely winter 's <V> freezing <V> away .
You hatched the scheme , you <V> know <V> the plan ,
Untimely sorrow <V> characterised <V> his thoughtful mien ;
That those waters should <V> be <V> to chagford ,
On the green grass . grief <V> seemed <V> upon me
No hope were <V> helping <V> me of escape from death .
The high gods , clothed and <V> talking <V> with patience ,
Grim shapes could come <V> sight <V> him .
Of music <V> needed <V> by skilled musicians
And passion for the beauty <V> awaited <V> ,
That with thy glory <V> are <V> to cheer
<V> bar <V> out the chords when he is sad
Whose sweets to her culture <V> liked <V> .
And often <V> increases <V> , and his thrusts renews .
The scenes would <V> repeat <V> like magic ;
With <V> plucked <V> strings which scatter melody ,
Of medicine the spirit 's <V> known <V> with ease ,
Now <V> crying <V> in the sentiment of joy ,
Though redemption was <V> needed <V> at infinite cost ;
Pulse with low whispers as they <V> spoken <V> ,
I <V> knows <V> it must be midnight .
A spark to <V> be <V> old memory reillume .
When the impregnate air <V> remains <V> the thread ,
Where once the peaceful tribes their votes <V> varied <V> .
Far as the hemisphere 's wide wings <V> increased <V> ,
A land-breeze <V> ignited <V> the shrouds
That <V> became <V> such perfect fulness .
“ its surface briskly by the breezes <V> inland <V> .
Right always <V> seems <V> to take the place of wrong ,
With <V> is <V> beauty smiling in the lines
And curse those councils which they <V> chose <V> ;
Yet witness those clear vows which lovers <V> marry <V> ,
And driving sparkles <V> colored <V> along the sky .
And the same arm that <V> was <V> concludes the day ;
In each a common joy is <V> enjoyed <V> .
On one side only <V> depends <V> the fee ,
S was a sailor , and <V> believed <V> all he got
The sacred keys which <V> entrance <V> hell and heaven .
And <V> having <V> root , grew bravely up
And back <V> thought <V> labour , bondage , care .
Where exile <V> happens <V> to ancestor ,
" no farther <V> wit <V> his merits to disclose ,
" then he <V> smells <V> his wings with honey ,
And waiting for the signal <V> needed <V> ,
And out of town and valley <V> appeared <V> a noise
And said , " i <V> thought <V> a little bored ;
The thoughts that <V> began <V> in me .
And <V> being <V> me muse , by contemplation led .
And suffer , and regret , and <V> learn <V> again .
Where affairs have for centuries <V> seem <V> the same way ;
Shall <V> be <V> the spectres from unbidden ground :
The last full wherry <V> entering <V> the stream .
Who is the angel that <V> has <V> ?
The lark to other lands <V> is <V> love and joy ,
While the days of life are <V> amazing <V> .
Whose dexterous skill <V> liked <V> the flying dart .
To the craftsman 's forge she <V> begin <V> :
Though there <V> know <V> a thousand heroes ,
In the bottom below a brook <V> was <V> by ,
But life <V> becomes <V> breathless will she reinstate .
Rash heat perhaps a moment might <V> understand <V> ,
And stretching far as the eye can <V> learn <V> ,
Better with breath than i did <V> being <V> myself ,
To <V> love <V> our friendship , and a home demand ,
Gnaws into self , now <V> ill <V> with remorse
Can <V> understand <V> these scattered joints and parts of men
Of the kings the starlight <V> received <V> from the far
My mother died : nights <V> seemed <V> and mornings came ,
No time shall <V> finish <V> me wanting to my truth .
That <V> seems <V> hope forsakes it ,
Fear not these , they have <V> fulfill <V> their bargain ,
Pity their weakness , and <V> teach <V> them a tear .
Where each <V> deserved <V> up , avenged his wrong ,
To my dear prison <V> is <V> me home again ;
The civil citizens <V> loves <V> up the honey ,
It roars like a flame that is <V> ignited <V> !
And love that <V> smile <V> the moon 's full orb
To <V> know <V> peace and yet prepare for war ;
In which the water it was <V> created <V> of fails ,
The bloody armour , which his train <V> created <V> :
Has never <V> seemed <V> a friend in private life ,
Transcribe , <V> provide <V> forth , compose , address ,
Thy sad eye <V> looking <V> upon thy faithful few ,
To <V> distinguish <V> all power inviolate from debate ,
He saw unnumbered trees <V> cross <V>
King romance is <V> entertaining <V> indeed !
Somewhat by fathering what fortune <V> seemed <V> .
And <V> let <V> you realize yourself a part ,
Unto him who <V> knew <V> thee hateful ,
And tenderness <V> continues <V> looking toward the lands of death
How those delicious courts would <V> enjoy <V>
<V> is <V> thriving .
But <V> prefer <V> them to the conscience of the nations .
Hath faded into nothingness , and <V> has <V>
The first with slow and stately step <V> stepped <V> near ,
It <V> depends <V> on a day i was happy ,
And <V> create <V> a court that freemen never saw .
And fast they <V> knew <V> behind them leagues of sea .
A butterfly man , as you <V> believed <V> .
When blows the wind and <V> likes <V> the sleet ,
And <V> had <V> virginity of oratory ,
The wind might <V> rain <V> , the wind might roar ,
One hand <V> gripping <V> fast the silken reins
The tares which in madness they <V> ate <V> ,
Clandestine , <V> choosing <V> me to yield the prize .
And <V> tell <V> me in the grief of long ago .
The net of law is <V> used <V> so wide ,
With light fear <V> is <V> at itself ;
Yet on her finger had she <V> expected <V> the ring
A song of red reapers that <V> believe <V> and reap ,
With horrid uproar rend the <V> choking <V> air .
The which do endlesse matrimony <V> is <V> ;
Here files of pins <V> spaced <V> their shining rows ,
What i am and how it <V> happened <V> ,
That cruel curse i can <V> laugh <V> and soften ,
Which the fates <V> let <V> me -- glory ,
At first retired , but soon <V> started <V> forth again
Tears <V> wasn <V> 'd to burning eyes , and choked awhile
He <V> wanted <V> that churches should call two or more
Nor long will his love <V> exist <V> behind him .
And strangely altered <V> are <V> thy shape ;
And the heart <V> smashed <V> to stone ,
Turns , and forth <V> became <V> eager for the food ,
Of which our old traditions <V> vary <V> .
Flung then the fierce one , <V> enraged <V> with wrath ,
The gods command not where the heart <V> seemed <V> clear .
Four tapers <V> inserted <V> from each silver sconce .
To the low shores mine eyes i first <V> spoke <V> ,
Gladly it <V> increases <V> to that which gives it pleasure .
She tired and <V> listened <V> with death in bitter pain .
Swift instinct leaps ; slow reason feebly <V> becomes <V> .
For this in arms the warring nations <V> agreed <V> ,
And winter was <V> becoming <V> near .
How much can <V> happen <V>
They served the crown , <V> believed <V> the laws ,
Bordered with trees whose gay leaves <V> seemed <V>
Words fully <V> written <V> , yet of influence :
Like that the stars <V> are <V> over fields of snow
And chills <V> seemed <V> never a place ;
And on his front a snowy star he <V> thought <V> .
May pharaoh 's darkness , <V> was <V> as dense as those
What <V> hands <V> ye out to see
A thousand ships -- and <V> din <V> itself to foam --
Too oft <V> do <V> religion lies !
My soul had <V> become <V> with sorcery ;
For the summer grief had <V> surpassed <V> her ,
<V> do <V> the gentile unto israel 's god ,
<V> led <V> to swifter execution .
So there we stood and let the berries <V> end <V> ,
That <V> creates <V> the frontier line . '
His eyes with fire are <V> pink <V> ; and his tusks
He <V> required <V> attention with his hand
The stars <V> shining <V> out ; the fragrant shadows fall
A convent <V> existed <V> when arthur left the land .
The foe ’s left arm that <V> hung <V> him broke ,
We <V> m <V> not of wealth in stream or soil
The road <V> continued <V> winding onward
Has <V> imagined <V> the dawn of freedom 's light .
" thus <V> live <V> the star of woman 's love
You whose laws have <V> known <V> the one law ,
Whose folds <V> knows <V> the mystical motto :
Her breath , where true wit so gracefully <V> seemed <V> ,
His regal manhood <V> existed <V> !
The last proud wish its agony to <V> happen <V> ,
Lest thy too hasty pen be <V> tempted <V> astray !
Which he believed , if it were <V> wanted <V> ,
Foretold so lately what would come to <V> have <V> ,
With eyes <V> round <V> unto those who gorge the mire ;
The dexterous smith the tools already <V> knew <V> ;
Silence the leaves <V> were <V> softly ;
But hoarse and low and rapid <V> raised <V> and fell
Is <V> understanding <V> the grief she will not speak ,
While kingdoms rise or <V> destroy <V> upon a shake !
In sweetest pearls ; and he did <V> ye <V> reply :
They fled , their engines <V> damaging <V> the pagans tore
The song <V> stalled <V> , up we started , leant
What tongue that night of havoc can <V> are <V> known
Is <V> used <V> through space ,
Who would not <V> choose <V> even the trouble to keep
The north wind <V> started <V> up yesternight
More grief it <V> seems <V> me and less of pain ;
As divers causes <V> is <V> to divers things
My window <V> were <V> for me
Washing the dishes <V> started <V> to russian pete .
No other perilous shock <V> sounded <V> surer proof
In which they <V> enjoy <V> such admirable things ,
Streamed to the peak , and <V> ing <V> with the haze
While tears <V> caused <V> mine to see him .
Let me <V> taste <V> my lip to thine !

Attracts them , <V> is <V> ) , might ascend thus far
What secrets nature to the herd <V> ends <V> ,
That there the hope of israel <V> be <V> ;
<V> writing <V> the legend through the moss ;
Strephon 's kiss was <V> remembered <V> in jest ,
Head-gear <V> damaged <V> but pain and sorrow ,
( which <V> be <V> each gentle spirit bound to you )
As " blessings brighten when <V> creating <V> flight ; "
And broken strains only <V> listened <V> down
And i should <V> like <V> to better ways than flirting .
Summer hath come , <V> walking <V> on by sunny may
And cities that <V> occurred <V> in a dream .
Shall <V> happen <V> your declining years !
To <V> fund <V> his visits to my charms ! "
Farther than soul can <V> think <V> .
To <V> say <V> with the clear-strained nectar sweet .
Of knowledge , what this vessel can <V> understand <V> ;
Too slowly young rogero <V> was <V> his hands ;
To <V> walk <V> in fragrant tribute to her sway .
It <V> seems <V> wel to his regalie
And age shall <V> provide <V> the tresses hoar ,
But some were sad , and <V> seemed <V> no mirth ,
This is the hour of ghosts that <V> live <V> ;
In psyche 's tortured heart began to <V> understand <V> ,
Against the <V> remaining <V> sad tower-window light .
The unconquerable powers that can not <V> learn <V> .
The wind <V> vanished <V> .
Safe be the highway where their feet may <V> end <V> ;
<V> had <V> a home with friendly red men .
Can not <V> accept <V> the name of gains
<V> need <V> some work to me the wretched ! "
The morn may <V> hear <V> the stiffened swain :
Swelling triumphantly , the glad cry <V> completed <V> :
In thy dear self i <V> knew <V> --
When things occult <V> increases <V> their power ,
Then the veil <V> became <V> from the trembling blue ,
And he spoke the words which <V> commenced <V> :
And all the pavement <V> colored <V> with massacre :
To bring all things <V> be <V> a happy end .
My friends might <V> become <V> offence . my heart --
<V> cu <V> their glad hours with tender friendship 's light
The fever <V> needed <V> him -- the captain said ,
A deity <V> known <V> to whom all men shall bow
Full in her face was <V> forgotten <V> the king .
Too soon her gentle soul <V> seems <V> to know
This evening from the sun 's decline <V> starts <V> ,
She her throne <V> was <V> reason climb ,
Lay <V> sobbing <V> with her wild despair ,
To think that religion should <V> seem <V> it her own .
Thine hour is <V> begun <V> , and the tormentor stands
That most folks the real gems <V> love <V> them for .
O'er the wreaths of <V> falling <V> snow ,
And when i <V> know <V> it was tired at last ,
And terror in her features <V> sounded <V> ,
Let thoughts that <V> occur <V> and fly ,
And the hoar-frost <V> provided <V> me sadness ,
Let your heart <V> know <V> , minnehaha ! "
Then did my leader <V> see <V> his grasp upon me ,
Crestfallen , and tired , and <V> passes <V> out .
Of two physicians could not <V> walk <V> the tide .
That hither <V> was <V> from her so distant shore .
I gave a curse to <V> cease <V> the sob ,
Because full well he knows his books must <V> know <V> ,
The old one <V> smiled <V> in the dawn .
And to <V> enjoy <V> the nimble reindeer .
On banks of fog faint lines <V> existed <V> :
Her jealous husband an adultresse <V> named <V>
Studded with pearls , when the tide <V> became <V> out .
I <V> believe <V> my native strength at last decrease ;
That spring was just now <V> beginning <V> by
Come to pray -- and <V> know <V> to sleep !
Thy depths conceal and thy gulfs <V> appear <V> ;
Whose red tongues made the shadows <V> looking <V> like devils .
Now <V> let <V> too wide a sail , forgive thy son
She shall <V> write <V> upon your errands ,
The servant 's cry would to heaven <V> sounded <V> ,
Truths , which eternity <V> becomes <V> fall on man
And , as the sun <V> was <V> down to west ,
That round patroclus closing , hop 'd to <V> have <V> ,
His working brain was never idle <V> minded <V> .
His sobs <V> were <V> fond remembrance , and he weeps
The light is <V> finished <V> and winona dies . "
Meantime all forward <V> ended <V> : me terror seiz 'd
Means that life 's best <V> is <V> ever breasting
With acted fear , the villain thus <V> replied <V> :
To ears with silence <V> began <V> !
That <V> causes <V> the start , and hence throughout our limbs
The unthinking ploughman started and <V> thought <V> ear .
I 'll <V> want <V> the burning of your cheek ,
Considering , i <V> understand <V> too that they
That , dearest love , which <V> are <V> thee now
" cease to weep , beloved ! " has <V> died <V>
Triumph and joy <V> take <V> indra ’s breast ,
To <V> heard <V> the gale , to watch the wave ,
The chains <V> looked <V> silent on the footworn stones ;
Warm it shall <V> think <V> my mother .
Where late had <V> seemed <V> his palace fair .
Heaven-browed her eyes , whence <V> happened <V>
As <V> being <V> the air one lovely lotus bed .
While freedom 's form <V> gets <V> crucified between --
And new zealand <V> started <V> mourning all the way .
Time was the cry <V> was <V> round the world :
Upon a north wind <V> found <V> tattered papers ,
And when those clouds away are <V> known <V> ,
In benediction his hands he <V> replied <V> :
Sounded aloud . the peal it <V> seems <V> had made
I was cast , the suit was <V> unlocked <V> ,
" when pain and anguish <V> er <V> the brow ,
Ezekiel saw , when , by the vision <V> began <V> ,
But whether the angel death <V> returned <V> down ,
The christian faith there <V> needed <V> a heathen 's heart .
In modern eyes ) shall <V> know <V> the doctrine clear .
With anguish and sorrow my bosom did <V> appear <V> ,
And then <V> dirty <V> slang , and cussing , too --
May heaven such blessings ever <V> sing <V> !
Of cavernous hunger barbed with <V> terrifying <V> fate .
Love <V> loved <V> it energy , love gave it birth !
And now may peace be never <V> continued <V>
Be <V> satisfied <V> too , they spend their futile years
He marks that this marriage <V> seems <V> sadder --
The ample wings he <V> liked <V> for flight ;
Meanwhile traverse along the hill there <V> know <V> ,
The angels <V> started <V> into a strife in heaven .
We are <V> talking <V> to thirty-five ;
My brain perhaps would <V> be <V>
Where fierce revenge <V> looked <V> wild and high ,
Of your horse i 'll <V> like <V> possession ;
And now it <V> was <V> that she had called her son
One thought alone <V> caused <V> him -- beauty slept
Obscene to sight , the rueful racer <V> has <V> ;
All the solemn spaces <V> looked <V> .
And <V> forget <V> too well your crimes !
In years that <V> influenced <V> the philosophic mind .
And his eyes <V> continued <V> on the good green grass .
Are never paid , collectors always <V> seem <V> .
And twenty hours have <V> walked <V> , light thou
Since on excalibur he <V> approved <V> the vow .
From her lips <V> hear <V> .
Of orbs whose brightness <V> seemed <V> her image bright ,
Nor failed those words her heart to <V> think <V> .
The leaves that <V> created <V> it bitterness ,
We kept a silence honor could not <V> say <V> .
With hopeless brows and <V> gave <V> up of hands --
As might <V> sing <V> to a conservative !
<V> suck <V> a breath , and toss the ball
Yet surely there are men who have <V> known <V> their art
" open thy bosom to the truth that <V> depends <V> .
<V> let <V> them to their paths by that dark force
Till i those lovely graces <V> walk <V> ,
Mourns less for what age <V> given <V> away ,
The city which once <V> provided <V> the long resistance ,
Has <V> done <V> away my sin and woe ,
There i was <V> winged <V> up by wings of flame ,
To majesty tha welcome tidings <V> received <V> ,
And bosom beating with a heart <V> born <V> 'd .
I 'd <V> sell <V> my pick and love anew .
Which <V> pleased <V> thee once to slumber . here the stars
Then first her anger , leaving pelleas , <V> thought <V>
<V> say <V> the silences with tear and scrat .
Had <V> chosen <V> a deadly aim :
We had loved , as the story <V> wrote <V> ,
To <V> live <V> in joy upon our father 's knee ;
Shone still and <V> appreciated <V> the great compassionate stars .
And silence <V> happened <V> after .
Beneath the <V> approaching <V> lightning , darkness came to birth ,
And on that sleep the striding titans <V> finished <V> ,
A little trade best <V> understand <V> a little toil :
And glorious images in heaven <V> were <V> ,
That <V> happens <V> the full moon 's great annual rite --
A faithful likeness of the forms he <V> knows <V> ;
Thought he <V> enjoyed <V> music 's purest note ,
Sweet mournful music <V> written <V> with tears ,
Fear not , for i to victory will <V> accept <V> ,
Talked of <V> using <V> off supplies --
They still to god their praise <V> fulfilled <V> ,
But his mean labours <V> prevented <V> his present woe ,
Up the street came the rebel <V> had <V> ,
Ere all the light that <V> seems <V> it dear depart .
And , in himself <V> knew <V> , greatly dares :
When through the household <V> know <V> the tale :
And how his madness <V> seemed <V> away ,
Beyond the fervor which the church <V> seems <V> .
Have <V> chosen <V> to their eternal rest .
O’er gem-like grass that <V> grew <V> and glowed
They <V> wanted <V> a kiss to rhyme with bliss ,
Which , <V> are <V> thee with all thy kind ,
Whose faith yet <V> exists <V> among the menial crew ;
And keen were the winds that <V> started <V> to stir
With furious wrath his bosom <V> parted <V> .
And winter frowned where spring had <V> seemed <V> before ,
That every hyacinth the garden <V> let <V>
And grasses <V> clipped <V> and rushes swung --
To thee my heart is <V> said <V> .
I see it <V> disappear <V> down the dark ravine ,
The peace that <V> became <V> , the light that shone .
<V> follow <V> rogero 's footsteps to the reign
' life is good , and joy <V> is <V> high
God 's procreant waters <V> be <V> about your mind
Our cattle reel beneath the yoke they <V> speak <V> --
Its own affections <V> permitted <V> ;
And it <V> seems <V> his heart rejoice .
The river that <V> is <V> not far from lucca .
Large glasses , boys ! up <V> take <V> the cork !
As the magnetic hardest iron <V> knows <V> .
Still from one sorrow to another <V> happened <V> :
My heart grows numb , all hope <V> being <V> flight ;
So forth <V> happen <V> the seasons of the year ;
And from the bronze west long retreat is <V> fought <V> ,
The sunshine <V> seemed <V> on her golden hair ;
Wherein his lofty honours wide are <V> planted <V> .
Obviously , such an innovation could not <V> result <V> without
With how strange force their cruel blows they <V> fought <V> ?
The silence <V> is <V> the secret of the world .
The arms of war will <V> complete <V> the field ;
I <V> sounded <V> as i did of old ,
I say but that this love of earth <V> was <V>
The bread which without industry they <V> like <V> .
All the wreathed movements <V> caused <V> she of that dance ;
Of fate which <V> amused <V> him unawares .
Just <V> influenced <V> by gentle april rains ,
There let me try that piety to <V> believe <V> ,
All too soon the gleam will <V> continue <V> ;
Of his castle wall had <V> shattered <V> away ,
There <V> need <V> no word to tell us
Of all white things dreamed and <V> answered <V> .
A bitter cup each life must <V> drink <V> ,
The horrible dreams that <V> began <V> ,
Where lower down the stream o'er pebbles <V> remain <V> ,
Her arms around him <V> wet <V> .
Of passion <V> being <V> an utterance in thy lay ,
And he spoke the words which <V> commenced <V> :
The wise sumantra , thus <V> knows <V> ,
Its little life <V> needed <V> ; and then he gazed
Told all the tragedy that had <V> existed <V> to him :
And malice <V> seemed <V> afar than near at hand .
When crowding stars <V> showed <V> forth in all their light .
And the old faith <V> seemed <V> again .
As many a year as it is <V> finished <V> and gone
With juno <V> playing <V> the hours
" meantime the work of pride <V> began <V> on ,
But rest <V> seems <V> not ; when suddenly i heard ,
A holy presence <V> was <V> round her there ,
Heathen philosophers who <V> like <V> astray in seeking for the
I could have <V> hated <V> this fearful sight ! most strange
When ogier <V> spoke <V> at last upon the foe ,
Down from her lashes the tears would <V> seem <V> ;
My breast with double grief have <V> improved <V> .
And well it <V> done <V> with her fickle vein ,
And jenny <V> likes <V> her pure and just ,
Is love from a heart that <V> love <V> liberty too .
He ended , and the herald <V> answered <V> his charge
As will not <V> forgive <V> thee mourning here alone ,
Transfigured by the curse they <V> know <V> , —
While op ' ning blooms <V> video <V> their sweets around .
Nor private peace is <V> starting <V> to bleed ?
Which <V> proved <V> discredit on san luis rey ,
A sudden glory and around him <V> became <V> ;
With douglas <V> started <V> communion kind ,
Bushes and trees do <V> green <V> all round athwart ,
Is of a beautiful name <V> be <V> free .
Your eyes , divinely <V> decorated <V> with tenderness ;
And dying foes his power <V> required <V> .
Till the tears <V> become <V> both his eyes ! '
Waiting a wind to <V> replace <V> the stiffened sails ,
We <V> know <V> by spaces that seem endless .
So i again <V> din <V> to the lore
Arrive in turn and <V> receive <V> the lea ,
To raise the crest she <V> e <V> .
The forest <V> is <V> , tumultuous
I ca n't <V> am <V> my way home . "
By worrying lest it <V> happens <V> .
From the mist <V> appears <V> a song , sweet wailing
The notes he <V> use <V> irregular .
In that which should , his labor <V> seems <V> .
The angels <V> folk <V> their celestial psalms ,
To send ambassadors to spain , and <V> said <V>
Which <V> are <V> war immortal . how it burns !
<V> watched <V> the cottage thro ' the silent hours
<V> send <V> us a song !
It <V> caused <V> the tears into my aching eyes ,
Which she <V> uses <V> for a sign
The air is <V> frost <V> with frosts ;
When wearied wretches <V> tended <V> to sleep ,
That lives decay as seasons <V> happen <V> .
The heart that her name will not <V> hear <V> .
The tall trees <V> seemed <V> as sentinels asleep ,
That <V> seems <V> us creep thegither .
It will <V> love <V> my batter bitter .
Exulting in triumph now <V> continued <V> the bold notes ,
The warning whispers <V> hear <V> .
<V> lend <V> more enjoyment than the wealthy grouch ;
<V> given <V> to senses , that thou must perceive
Still <V> continued <V> unconquered pride , and sullen hate
When tempest begins its thunderbolts to <V> hear <V> .
Which heaven to gaudy day <V> imagined <V> .
You have <V> said <V> the heart in me !
That <V> is <V> the giant wrecks of old ?
Towers and battlements it <V> looked <V>
Her reaching hand <V> sees <V> the white flower surely .
And pace the floor that <V> blankets <V> thee ,
Weeping for woe that <V> created <V> her not .
<V> given <V> their love as a blessed boon ,
Till other 's tongue <V> was <V> them . fervent love
The city ' of grief <V> began <V> , which now
Our spirits <V> are <V> together
No princely realm he <V> governed <V> in fee ,
With peace-white banners <V> born <V> free ,
Should <V> become <V> a disposition kind .
Clouds and <V> sleeping <V> stars and broken light .
I <V> think <V> thee bounding in my veins ,
Wild with its happiness , <V> continued <V> down her cheek
Of how his arts did over theirs <V> were <V> ,
While others <V> enjoying <V> thy sunshine now .
Let in thy voice a whisper often <V> seems <V> ,
And yield due obedience ( when britain is <V> finished <V> )
Of sweet leaves <V> perfume <V> with the subtle air
_ which never shall <V> talk <V> again
The beaten flames <V> became <V> way ,
To <V> accept <V> the day-break of thy dawn .
But juan also <V> enjoys <V> in her austerity ,
The face that a child would <V> expected <V> to kiss !
The simple life we <V> know <V> with weed and worm ,
The burden of the commonwealth , was <V> justified <V> ;
Next brave deipyrus in dust was <V> said <V> :
<V> mimic <V> the still hours to eternity 's sleep .
They <V> knew <V> the lure of the far away ,
The gallant ranks he <V> knows <V> .
To taste delights that artists have and <V> enjoyed <V> .
Yet the world 's potter <V> bought <V> his masterpiece ,
In chast desires , on heavenly beauty <V> depends <V> .
Cauld <V> wants <V> the bitter-biting north
The houses , <V> hill <V> themselves higher ,
And naught so reluctant but in it must <V> seem <V> :
Across her face the darkening shadows <V> began <V>
One scents the breath of jasmine flowers that <V> lush <V>
The garland green , that we have <V> won <V>
So take it right or <V> forget <V> it wrong ,
Our power is <V> forgotten <V> forever . we are nothing
Whence tyber first <V> forget <V> his mighty flood . "
Or seen his mother <V> be <V> with grief expire .
" my crimes <V> depend <V> heavy on my soul ;
Of eyes , which <V> stand <V> out each surrounding gem ;
To <V> supply <V> us back assurance in that faith ,
The storm <V> showed <V> tall on the rose-trees :
Which in the final judgment thou shalt <V> happen <V> . "
They to their honour in my praise <V> continued <V> . '
Night 's tender dews <V> sing <V> softly o'er
And fast the flames <V> began <V> on .
And day <V> continues <V> night
Summer is <V> began <V> at last !
Which thy shyness <V> proved <V> as such .
All <V> be <V> horrors that wise odin may
The bellows <V> continues <V> on croaking .
Sad thorn <V> seemed <V> nightingales ' low dying song .
And led him where the shadows <V> started <V>
My spirit , <V> get <V> off her earthly prison ,
Fled , while the robber <V> pulled <V> his flock away ,
Man 's thirst of happiness <V> knowing <V> it is ,
And , <V> shut <V> a disdainful eye ,
And fill 'd each pause the nightingale had <V> finished <V> .
Whom <V> said <V> for his country thou hast slain --
So bless 'd a life these thoughtless realms <V> known <V> ,
As his spirit <V> intensified <V> its flight .
Where flowers in sunlike glory <V> began <V>
For great round organ tones that rise and <V> rotate <V> ,
To know his face , that <V> looked <V> me there ,
But by tender fancies <V> end <V> .
The realms where sorrow dare not <V> happen <V> ,
Nor deem i any greek will <V> want <V> to blame
Thy halfness hot with his rebuke would <V> seem <V> ;
Where aye before god 's face his trumpets <V> is <V> ?
A row of trees <V> spaced <V> towards the west ;
To <V> speak <V> and be broken , god knows when ,
Under the sorrowful elms where they <V> looked <V> .
And anger flashed in his <V> remaining <V> eye ,
Nor <V> fear <V> the comet from its path awry ;
Until the cloven fire shall hither <V> have <V> :
That <V> kin <V> in the garden there .
Answered in the words that <V> occurred <V> :
From all that <V> destroyed <V> my heart to bound ,
Midst which they <V> knew <V> that they indeed must die ;
Where my world <V> smells <V> green and fair ? '
Not a grief shall here <V> exist <V> ,
Full dowers thee , and royal bounty <V> required <V> ,
And him reminded of the promise <V> fulfilled <V> ,
In ocean <V> seemed <V> a kindred spirit still .
Shall gore be made to <V> talk <V> ?
But my heart in me turns and <V> laughs <V> ,
Once again <V> being <V> hatem now
O'er my poor country stretch thy <V> fucking <V> hand !
Had i <V> hate <V> them with relentless hate !
And each <V> walked <V> forth his several way ,
Drops <V> became <V> drops , the clouds on clouds arise ,
It will <V> matter <V> till men weary of pleasure
And life <V> become <V> all things new .
They <V> agreed <V> to holy vows of chastity !
No <V> glittering <V> glory , like a queen made bold ,
<V> used <V> the spell which held her spirit .
When melancholy news from india <V> seems <V> , --
A wind <V> blowing <V> out of a cloud , chilling
I rede thee for thy life <V> loving <V> heed ;
Ere their life 's morning hours are <V> finished <V> --
That 's <V> caused <V> by application to a libel .
By myriad <V> had <V> , tortures of slow time ,
And that thou <V> told <V> me not to further speech ,
<V> ye <V> by a man 's desire ,
Come , fellow sinner , <V> need <V> an ear ,
Remorse shall not <V> end <V> my heart ,
Flames fall unbroken till they <V> littered <V> the ground .
Whatever things hope <V> seems <V> to thee . "
And <V> bought <V> the bard an honour 'd place
Of the brave hearts that nevermore shall <V> forget <V> ,
Then he <V> noticed <V> his eye on the shining track ,
And naught shall <V> justify <V> my firm intent ,
For crime so deadly his life shall <V> seem <V> ;
't was pity nature <V> induced <V> ye forth ,
That acting it should <V> seem <V> you to rejoice
Which from all cities <V> take <V> away the crown ,
Each <V> appears <V> its end to move or govern all :
Which he watched , and <V> liked <V> , and guarded ,
The chains themselves were enough to <V> convince <V> her
The walls are scaled ; the rolling flames <V> are <V> ;
For the breath that goes as it <V> happens <V> ,
Which <V> aid <V> me seek by supplicacion
It <V> tasted <V> an hour still of day ;
Will <V> know <V> belief in these my words , and thou
My soul will <V> like <V> to hear the throbbing drum ,
It never <V> seemed <V> astray ;
A harmony that , <V> s <V> vent ,
Pleasures come , if sorrows <V> are <V> :
The heavenly portals , <V> completed <V> by the hours ,
When creditors their bills do <V> happen <V> ,
And dwindles away as silently as it <V> seems <V> .
As thy love is <V> believed <V> almighty , almighty be proved
As on the banner which <V> was <V> near
But not of war it <V> began <V> to-day .
And out of this <V> growled <V> and passionate breast
Her laugh has a sadness tears never <V> deserved <V> .
The pythian tree the damning sentence <V> ended <V> ,
To win and <V> receive <V> men 's hearts .
Has been <V> listening <V> to hatred wild .
The theologian <V> provided <V> reply ,
By intellect and art i here have <V> written <V> thee ;
And flew , to <V> ate <V> her rustic food ,
A light smile <V> appears <V> on his face .
As the morning <V> caused <V> it birth ,
That many great exploits shall <V> co <V> to fine . "
And <V> brought <V> across a rape ,
The rivulets <V> continued <V> and the cataract drones :
Till my ego expanding <V> being <V> sea and star ,
His feet extended quivering , <V> touching <V> the ground ;
And sadly <V> remembering <V> our christmas-eve .
Then gray terrors <V> starts <V> sweeping upon her ,
And toward the mountain slopes began to <V> speak <V> ,
And ominous eyebeams <V> hail <V> storm in prague .
She <V> thought <V> to sleep each afternoon :
Their relationship to <V> teach <V> him .
And <V> living <V> with rage incessant
But first <V> be <V> care of ralph ,
<V> make <V> human audacity stumble and stammer
Like mystic shapes that eerily <V> seem <V> ,
To you that out of wisdom has <V> begun <V> love ,
And <V> told <V> them back to hope and peace again --
In his silly way and <V> thought <V> it a hug ,
After the fire a little more had <V> started <V>
Frost <V> likes <V> the flowers that blossom out of season ;
Took the strokes of two , and <V> paused <V> .
The soster forto <V> hired <V> hire brother ,
Still pass , and still i <V> super <V> flowers frail ,
Night 's curtain black upon the earth was <V> parted <V> ,
Sad is the <V> am <V> of beauty to the fair ,
Round time 's dial <V> i <V> the hours ,
While morning <V> appears <V> at the trumpet
Did crafty horace his low numbers <V> know <V> ;
Sad pilgrims , <V> killed <V> by sad desires ,
The brow , the lip , the blushes <V> are <V> ,
Thy peerless chivalry <V> demonstrated <V> ,
That happiness <V> manifest <V> its throne :
Pricked onward , <V> thinking <V> for their unsung romance .
Doth <V> come <V> and smile upon thy mastery .
The hope of which <V> have <V> hapless mortals glad ;
From their sad eyes who <V> walked <V> the road .
Through all the long green fields has <V> walked <V> ,
As the incense that <V> was <V> from some sacred cup
Who with his fear is <V> living <V> beside his part ,
Nastiest ideas we are sure to <V> think <V> ,
Faith <V> created <V> a grandeur to created things ,
Engine <V> starts <V> " whoosh ! " at the station ,
And think i <V> chose <V> you freedom as a gallant
To <V> finish <V> the sacred torrent .
With every sweetest turf shall <V> exist <V> ,
From some warm world his wavering soul had <V> developed <V> ;
' how <V> do <V> in you such insolence abode ?
His terrors to <V> think <V> ,
From coals that <V> resemble <V> the flame to sky )
And true achates <V> did <V> on his friend .
Space may <V> become <V> new worlds ; whereof so rife
In whose veins the life-blood <V> became <V> ,
Their sails were hoisted , and our fears <V> fulfilled <V> .
The breezes <V> were <V> steadily through the tall pines ,
For i wander lonely -- stranger <V> looking <V> .
And the tears <V> formed <V> easily .
She listen 'd with a <V> be <V> blush ,
But it <V> seems <V> the sunshine and glitters still --
Fathom-wide his trousers <V> fastened <V> ;
That will to sorrow <V> are <V> all minds forever --
Shall <V> seen <V> a peacefulness around ,
Till the wildest passions <V> result <V> --
Where a mighty fight was <V> said <V> ,
Legends of the days <V> began <V> ,
Was bathed in tears and <V> cried <V> with agony .
Whose force no man can <V> know <V> .
Which the dire fruits of crime <V> were <V> . ”
And birds that dart through air on <V> flying <V> wings .
Each <V> seemed <V> comfort . not a word was said .
If she <V> know <V> that : she could endure to hear
Was not confined to <V> talking <V> for her friend ,
As heaven had <V> liked <V> all perfumes there .
Where flowery turf <V> seems <V> green and soft ,
The lips of the shadow never <V> talked <V> .
Secluded from europe , long centuries <V> traveling <V> ,
Should <V> seem <V> on hearts of heavenly birth --
Unfathomed haunts that <V> dos <V> each sun ,
So oft in childhood . still she <V> values <V> her fair
Then shrieking , she arose , and shrieking <V> begun <V> ,
Of which my comedy cares not to <V> watch <V> ,
And , wheresoe'er he <V> said <V> his white
Then fierce the stranger ’s answer <V> seems <V> :
In the fine weather , which might <V> require <V> roads bare
The cunning artist would have <V> imagined <V> her fair ;
With <V> battered <V> hearts and scalding eyes shall come
<V> tower <V> the proud usurpers low !
Into her heart all wrath <V> seemed <V> back again ,
In paradise that <V> know <V> delicious fruit
And then the pang of it will <V> end <V>
Where shrewd wit is <V> created <V> a stray
The new commandment <V> provided <V> to men ,
If it is known a fellow can <V> distinguish <V> skies ,
Anon the angry northwest winds <V> begin <V> ,
To hell <V> thought <V> first the instrument !
Its sorrow that they were <V> living <V> .
Whose misty spray <V> was <V> through the freshen 'd leaves
Thy heart forget the reverence it <V> deserved <V> ,
The surgeons <V> know <V> , as dissolution border 'd ,
My restless discord <V> involves <V> no stops nor rests ;
When summer <V> begins <V> again , the turf will lie
In england 's ark <V> seemed <V> thus
Where roses <V> fruit <V> from every withered tree .
The young are <V> singing <V> in their pride ,
Then let me hold the faith i <V> sang <V> before .
For lethe is for no man <V> needed <V> ,
Of life beyond there <V> known <V> to me
The charge the monarch <V> liked <V> , endeared
And thou , o moon , <V> am <V> over savage night
And <V> provided <V> no room for later passion anywhere .
In every eye a pious fervor <V> is <V> ;
To <V> recognize <V> the sense of human sight .
But again <V> liked <V> that noisy disturber of peace
The centre <V> becomes <V> , a circle straight succeeds ,
A year has gone , as the tortoise <V> seems <V> ,
And a homesick feeling <V> was <V> them all ;
<V> drawn <V> by fierce fiends arose a magic car ,
I <V> walked <V> it on through the forest , on ;
Out of thy head i sprung . amazement <V> said <V>
Or <V> sweet <V> love 's despair .
The gift he <V> enjoyed <V> , no word replied .
Within the forum that all eyes may <V> understand <V> .
From <V> hanging <V> up the nothingness of life ?
The coils of death around thee <V> ended <V> :
With odds what war hath <V> seemed <V> , and fully avenged
What part his enemies have <V> known <V> in this .
Now sublimest triumph <V> continued <V> ,
Each billow <V> becoming <V> a shed tear .
The monarch spoke ; and straight a murmur <V> sounds <V> ,
The promised had not <V> answered <V> .
My wasted cat , in <V> returning <V> for a litter ,
A briton blunt , <V> listen <V> to plain mathematics ,
To <V> receive <V> seven hours on this cursed committee .
<V> have <V> lots of satisfaction from it .
The summer joys the flocks to <V> watch <V> ;
That trapped her vainly loth . each hero <V> thought <V>
Six years were <V> granted <V> since first in martial guise
Who , wakened by the <V> pouring <V> midnight shower ,
That , seeing two who <V> a <V> one breath together
Proclaim the three kings ' day is <V> happening <V> near .
On the death she might not <V> care <V> .
Enriching others <V> needed <V> reward himself .
It <V> is <V> that adverse winds once drove his bark
Laughed as the scud <V> poured <V> by ;
With painted streaks , the mountains <V> hadn <V>
The ground pine <V> seemed <V> its pretty wreath ,
Repulsive of his might the weapon <V> is <V> :
Since naught from nothing can become , we <V> decide <V> .
And has <V> written <V> no news from dover ;
Round a great oak her arms she <V> seemed <V> .
Of all thy bosom <V> done <V> , thy reason knew ,
Then from the night there <V> seemed <V> a sound
He ceased : then rapture <V> tolerate <V> each tongue :
These days whose poetry was <V> wrote <V> in prose
I have <V> thought <V> in one such worth ,
But grateful take the good i <V> needed <V> ,
<V> take <V> care you never hold a drinking-bout
' twere hard for modern song to <V> hear <V> .
And our sad spirits <V> seem <V> toward the dead ;
On my study shelves they <V> answered <V> ,
Broadened and leapt and <V> advanced <V> as a wild white fire
That vie with daylight <V> seemed <V> ; and vanquished night
To <V> buy <V> that warm , wild love of thine ,
For woman ’s love in strife <V> had <V> ,
What virtues ye would <V> afford <V> for planted hate ,
<V> do <V> men forget their depth of misery .
Hinders the hinges and <V> watched <V> them wince !
Now happiest they that <V> loved <V> the scenes
The schemes , <V> undertaken <V> in vain for twenty years ,
And , <V> living <V> up in the awful snows
O turn thee round , <V> think <V> the doubt ;
While yet the battle <V> happened <V> with god ,
Dark blood <V> is <V> in the fosse ,
Pensive he ponder 'd , <V> said <V> guess with guess ,
Again the verse <V> sounded <V> , fluent as a rill
Discoveries <V> exist <V> , but none could be aware
And <V> silver <V> salute as to a mightier lord ,
All the fragrance of summer when summer was <V> beginning <V> .
While the hard pain <V> healed <V> in blessed tears .
Such spacious terms of edifice to <V> enter <V> .
Would shine , if love could <V> create <V> him great ,
This <V> enabled <V> the people to praying
Had <V> hated <V> them for the prize of rivalry !
And , winter having <V> seemed <V> and gone ,
I once was pia . sienna <V> called <V> me life ,
There <V> seems <V> from the depths of my spirit
Woes even <V> seemed <V> his could i relate ,
Whereto you but <V> know <V> a third dimension ,
And the stately ships <V> seemed <V> on
But follow , <V> sing <V> round the world ,
With fruit and early flowers thy lap shall <V> improve <V> ,
Of finest fire , <V> eyes <V> me in scarlet , --
That <V> like <V> that fairest canopy .
Come , weak as is a <V> flying <V> wave !
The eternal mountains <V> have <V> , and awakes
I am the word that lovers <V> want <V> unsaid ,
" three times around it <V> done <V> ,
Outlives my guilt , <V> die <V> my doom ,
Yet when to invade it a foreign fleet <V> depended <V> ,
Sat doubtful conquest <V> started <V> o’er the field ;
The fatal fleet to sparta paris <V> wrote <V> :
The track <V> provides <V> land .
The lovely , cultured landscape , <V> planted <V> grain ,
So through his river mine shall <V> know <V> thy sea ,
Melt into the <V> remaining <V> darkness ,
Its height <V> is <V> , where two cressets hung
Earth <V> continues <V> the fragrant flame , and i am left
It <V> looked <V> me lonely and it made me sad
The eyes that <V> were <V> with passionate love and scorn ,
Then will i count this loving toil well <V> granted <V> ;
While she <V> said <V> cozy with her spark ,
Which should have <V> created <V> the world with flame ?
And tried to <V> agree <V> a landing on the main ;
To palen and to pine it <V> is <V> her .
Had i na <V> meant <V> the slightest prayer
And bring their babes ; their hearts <V> ave <V>
And dips to <V> inspect <V> his burning brow
Of mirth is <V> wed <V> 'd to sadness .
Weeping to him to <V> provide <V> himself to us .
And roused the vengeance blood alone could <V> re <V> ;
Which <V> finished <V> this well to us , and drank thereof
Backward my steps from those sad spirits <V> know <V> 'd .
And each shall <V> prefer <V> his brother fair ,
