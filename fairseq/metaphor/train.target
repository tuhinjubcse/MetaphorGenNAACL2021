Second in age , — her health declare .
Thy steps make music , measured music , near :
Happily they reach 'd the princess ' dwelling ,
All turn their looks in silence , with their breath
Worlds where my stranger soul sang songs to me ,
On your hand as it waved adieu
More fierce he 's found than lion or leopard ;
You touched me and tingled into love .
Thorough the fog it came ;
Mingled they the song of woe ,
And not a spark of light but those that leapt
Where my thoughts fly back to be
And gave them visions of divine content ;
The secret how each virtue might be gained ;
These relies of a guilty race
Lone wandering , but not lost .
Blossom not thorns and flowers not blood should break .
And the rebels ' race is run ;
I summon up remembrance of things past ,
To draw their chairs to dwell in converse pure
Fired with anger , threatened vengeance ,
The wood-tick has kept the minutes well ;
They couple foolish words and look for birth
She ran till her knees gave way .
Yet what no mortal hand could make ,
So grows the rising year , and so declines
Where it lay in place of rafael 's glory ,
For which they claim their sunday 's due ,
Beneath new skies they hold their dreadful way
What way in search of silence to pursue :
Each in its cauld hand held a light .
And shook the leaves of every thought
Save to wait for the sign to come :
The pear trees stand .
Give me thine indignation -- which is love
The boat glides , waning less and less --
We bathed our hands with speechless glee ,
Only thy joy could share .
That , when a soul is found sincerely so ,
He shows her where his hidden treasure lay .
Of his position i can give no notion :
My heart gives you love .
Ay , you whose vital spark hath sped :
Soon hector , noting his retreat , aloud
A great dark flame runs wild .
Upon old occleve 's face the fury changed
So -- so the days go fleeting
Which met at thy creating ; at whose joys
That took no thought of weariness ,
Forth came the victims of apollo next ,
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel ;
Now were their anchors cast ,
Once , before you turn to sleep ,
A wildered smile lay on his noble lips .
By doctrines fashioned to the varying hour ;
There she collects the force of female lungs ,
To a slave comes rarely pleasure ;
And a silence came down for a while ,
Oh the spirit-shares stand badly !
His fixed decree can change or shun .
And the pleasant shade that welcomes our feet
Nor hath she ever chanced to know
And fit the limpid element for use ,
_ truly he 'll see war _ .
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain . "
Had held her heart a captive from my own .
The calm that wisdom steals from woe ;
Right from the hand of god her spirit came
Quick to break hearts and quench the dying flame ;
Follow 'd days devoid of profit .
To fell the lofty cedar of the world
Around the shrine , and made the same request :
Silver breathes the breath of sorrow . "
From joys that diminish , and woes that increase ,
Give thy house a thorough cleansing ,
In battle ne’er could look on thee .
And others follow ; -- sire and son
Now hath the summer reached her golden close ,
I combat with grief and despair .
Some oblivion perchance which could plead less excuse
Now i have broken beauty 's wall ,
Which from their proper loins are sprung )
But fairies have broke their wands ,
All the woodlands ring with music ,
There do the hideous harpies make their nests ,
Is not expressed by suns alone ,
Rise up for reverence . she to paris made
And deaths that just hang by a hair ;
I dreamed i caught your loveliness
She raised her eyes to the wondering sprite ,
The clouds are marching slow ,
Let not your heart be troubled , jesus said ;
The silence hears the shades deplore
Through suffering , or my heart be freed
America for freedom speaks ,
But the end has come as god knows best :
I almost catch their perfume sweet ....
The songs that make her grieve .
If on _ ambition _ 's swelling tide ,
These were the signs god set on me ;
Not knowing what to feel or if i understand
Were spun upon a core of golden sound ,
Whose wondrous glory shines afar :
But i hardened my heart against the sacred bird ;
I saw the deeds of sin and soil ,
Arose , with grief inscribed , a mournful flower ;
But life gone breathless will she reinstate .
To give my gratefulness to you ?
Nothing of profit rests at thy dispose .
The struggles of this day have overcome me .
Whatever road i take , it joins the street
To carry that wonderful nose .
A flame ablaze that leaps amid the skies !
There came , minute , remote , the cry ,
His spirit passed , and crashing down he fell ,
So unconscious of all that awakens my pity ,
The visions departed , and shame followed passion : --
Whose eye could pierce the veil of future time .
Beyond this restless , rocking world of ours .
Or morning gun-fire 's smoke is curling ;
Her fountains sing o ' freedom still ,
Forsaking oeta mounts the evening star !
And follow gladly to the wondrous tune
Some pleasant while , and through each limb there came
And filled the hours with gloom ;
His age deplored them , foul with dye ;
May have diverted from continual watch
Her gathered beams , great palace now of light .
The people held a cattle fair ;
Nathless her forehead twitched a sad content ,
Ye nought but frowns might trace .
The youth by one unchanging faith is tied
Havoc fell of the foe he made ,
Suffering no flowers except its own to mount ?
A cipher hid , which makes it certain
It drives them : hope of rest to solace them
Whence arose thy fangs of poison ?
The waterfowl hold a regatta ;
Sins beneath scorn , and only lit by dreams ,
Above decay , it lingered there !
Bright without blaze it went and came :
Swift as an arrow goes !
Has found his upward way , i answer thee ,
The mother cow still follows near
What torture death have you sent her seeking now --
And on my flight let her her trophies build .
They cast their shadows for an instant
And felt his power ! marcus is the paw
Into his deep abyss my carcass draws ,
She comes , my love 's reward she bears .
Dishevelled leaves creep down
Swings us to face each other , and we feel
That fortune should his steps attend ,
As burning follows flame .
While the eternal pleasure , which direct
The call for help that rings through space
The star of evening sheds its trembling light ,
Still gave their worship to the god of day ,
Went flashing into paradise .
His mercy doth preserve me still ,
The victory with count orlando lies ;
Just as the sea gull made a swallow
How frail the cup that holds our joy !
Shows somewhat of that happier life to come ;
Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union .
It tells the speaker when to shriek
Whereon the tear stole silent down his cheek ,
They think that dignity of soul may come ,
And to look on thee eternity 's best part .
But the wreck of life shattered you see .
And boldly ventured on the liberties .
But of themselves those parts can never feel ,
Your blood flows sluggish in its channel --
Unready or undone by foul despair ?
A grief that to relief was turned .
And if any painter drew her ,
Could make my heart with rapture beat .
Provided , that the contest which arose
You hear the applause that greets your latest rival ,
And i , tossed by the tide of circumstance ,
The snowdrop 's whiteness stole --
Through all the limbs of hercules it spread .
Which some finical folks have pronounced a disgrace ;
And dash them till the threshold swam with blood ,
His sword flashed back their praise again .
But takes the wing that god has given ,
No vernal steam around they cast . -
She sank within my arms , and cried ,
Kite-borne threads , till lives are passed ,
Thou that giveth warmth and comfort ,
And so hath kept , steered by the guiding star
When conscience tries our courage with a test ,
And their tails like fans unfolded .
And know that these unhappy words reveal
Teague thought by some excuse to make amends --
He carried anger as a flint bears fire ;
Soon came a third your love to win ;
That i should get sic exaltation ,
For you her rivers flow , her hills arise !
With reddened eyes aglow with rage .
Choice dardan chiefs his friendship come to claim .
Their evil nature falsely hide ,
There comes a shout from calvary :
I heard the voice arising demanding bards ,
That easy trust , that prompt belief
Everything goes the same without me there .
And future years of bliss alone remain .
This room your radiant presence fills "
And vows are asked and given , shadows rise
What mood wears like complexion to thy woe ?
The phoenix builds her spicy nest ;
With strength renewed he quits the isle ,
Where his laughter erst rang clear .
V for the van that follows the train .
For if the ball had gone to hand
And beating stars ...
What flow ' ry meads hast found ,
Glory to heaven on high , it said ,
But love it is gives life .
In art or nature aught so passing sweet ,
We felt the minutes crawl :
The works the wizard time has wrought !
There came a tempest strong !
Who makes man from the fertile dust .
And the red sun lit the hill .
My tears run downward as i gaze ,
And two were sent . the first drew near :
And carrying such an appetite --
Whose heart with mirth is dancing wild .
Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air
With rigid fingers locked about the reins
Through two luminous windows saw
What annual offering shall i make ,
So beautiful , came foul and-twenty elders ,
And they go on wreathing the text again --
Where love has lit its fragrant fire ,
To reach the ocean in another name .
The wail of the breeze in the bending trees
As sages the matter explain ; --
Thick and scented daisies spread
Heard tidings of rinaldo 's victory blown ;
The grief i feel is all mine own ;
And nineveh , a city sinking slow
Hid in a perfume still supremely dear .
The dreadful darkness , shook to mounted sun ,
For future life still seeking councils new ,
A human soul , that drifts at liberty ,
For me , my friends another town shall frame ,
When rain begins to quench a pyre ;
The valiant prince his counsel gave :
On her fair looks a solemn hand he laid ;
That keeps the rust of murder on the walls --
A being made of rose and fire and mist ;
He unto this conclusion came —
No shape nor contour might descry .
Their souls saw clearer .
Making new year 's calls . "
And at the first slow notes my panpipes gave
I , too , a sudden tear have shed .
The largest mantle your full wardrobes hold ,
All in silver , housed in azure ,
Then , lastly , july comes , and she
Clasping the drug they had taken flying .
For when the soul is labouring in despair ,
Does youth come back ever to age ?
And make the strokes he bears his choice . "
This made thy glances to my soul the link --
The scatter 'd squadrons bend before his force ;
Another prodigious effort , and the knot yielded .
And india to his temple brought ,
As spring can spare the snows
Love makes the peasant monarch in his joy ;
And all should seek to do him courtesies .
Onward and onward careering they go ;
Now peter ran to seed in soul
That sees the shadow of the hawk
Soon is quenched its wasted light ,
Saying -- _ lo , the hours run !
The wounds by his avenging bolts impress 'd .
After first they had found their foes approach .
Ere yet the troop beyond two miles had gone ,
With ruling excellence atoning all .
The glory of greek shame was cast :
With senses checked , with arms upraised ,
And balen , stricken through the soul
One might not make of life and death
Of hazard , which admits no long debate ,
And o 're the dark her silver mantle threw .
Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too ,
Let death be felt and the proof remain :
Amid the leafless boughs let whispers steal ,
To lift your heart and hands to heaven .
And back i turned and bade the crone follow .
The flying winds have lost them all in air !
When wand ' ring wild , as fancy led ,
That marked his visage , fearfully ? --
For though the winds come frorely ,
And he sought by his inner perceptions to find
Breaking the silence of the seas
Australia , hasting from the southward , came ;
Of coiled gold serpents ready to make spring ,
Chill winds will blow ;
Gleams white where the willows toss ,
For he non abstinence made ;
The critics took , and doubtless read it .
And nailed her colours to the mast !
Or sometimes found a darkness stooped above me
To break the stillness -- to sit here alone
Flash upon flash , descends the lightning now !
She for long time through many countries strayed .
Lay the proud usurpers low !
And give our wearied minds a lively glow .
Yet making harmony breathe of life and disease ,
But by a token teaches us to trust ;
The hope that lifted him and led
Soon as her eyes the welcome object met ,
Poured forth from hearts which in thy blessings share !
Sometimes , over it rolls a purple shadow
Hopes which so often damped and chilled
What reverence his looks inspire !
This blade i have prepared against that hour .
Till comes the supreme stroke sent to divide us .
In the days that now are passing .
They break and shape again .
But her who joys the gift to take ,
' an omen ' rang the glad acclaim !
No wonder there may come some being ,
With lifted rood the slow monks swept along ,
Her more than earthly beauty made her seem
When golden dreamland lay within thy chart ,
“ together then the buffeting we 'll bear .
The lark soars up in the air ;
Our rapturous hearts , which gladly leap
And that great army answered its behests
And lips that swear i ruined her .
Dark with mysterious horror hath conveyed
To thy bosom lay my heart ,
And a vision her eyelids burned ;
To being 's depths would penetrate alone .
The lilacs where the robin built ,
" straightway iron made this promise ,
And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth ,
The wandering of his thoughts betrayed .
And clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts ,
Past any dream that horror shows .
Around his arms gay bracelets clung ,
Thoughts reserved thro ' many a day
Was vacant ; all the air hung sweet
All beholders , as they pass ,
Through earth ’s recesses forced their way .
Nor vineyards waiting , nor reproachful thorn ,
Shall i be flooded with life 's vital grace .
To span vast realms of space and time ,
But when i reached one dying autumn-tide
And follow all that peace disdains to seek ?
Upon hire love whanne he fell ,
The thread which binds it all in one ,
I fumbled at my nerve ,
O ! let their strains around us float ,
Freedom lives , and right shall stand ;
The love of fellow man as taught by christ ,
Seemed the conductor that drew down
And stamped with signs of regal sway .
Before their troops can reach the trojan lines .
The soul found passage through the spouting veins .
With thine own life , immortal glory give .
To pride and every churlishness inclined . "
Ignoble offsprings , they may fall
Which knew no god to soothe its grief ,
Of secret beauty the thickets clustered sweet :
Doctors , just come from curing half a score --
It makes him happy to think he 's sad .
There came a calmer hour in which i saw
The carriage held but just ourselves
Tracing your footsteps still with flowers that rise
That showed in truth a grievous disarray ;
But winter kills the orange-buds ,
The maid that kept her mother 's kine ,
The sun came through the frosty mist
Her houses rise in goodly show .
Of hope the praises in this height resound .
They come as a song comes out of the past
We have kept the longing warm within .
For chosen captains came from every crew ,
Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry ;
Love lights upon the heart , and straight we feel
It spreads its wings , unfolds its power ,
And nothing with him stayed .
That made them lovely in that vanished day ;
In tears , or sternly strive to conquer grief ?
To play the fool make up their mind ,
Now my hair has seen the tempest ,
Warm though it be , will quickly cloy --
And left the scene to solitude . once more
In doing what we most in suffering feel ?
Gathering her brows like gathering storm ,
That the voice moved , but sooner was extinct
The savage courage of their souls sustain 'd :
Did seem to hint at death that was the sum
And feel that i am happier then i know .
Soft as those kind looks she gave me ;
To follow where thy truth shall lead ;
That come a swooning over hollow grounds ,
No tree could ever bear them twice .
Then finding that love came not back to me ,
Beneath the woe his spirit failed ,
But nature calls the poet to her aid ,
And then sought to work his magic
A prodded ox , it drags and moans :
Where all sweet throats are calling , once be brave
His fame by serving a reflected light ,
Whose streams run forth there to the salt sea sides
Of sorrow has been crushed .
And at the rainbow 's foot lay surely gold ,
And there the last blue boundaries rise ,
For words oft give but echo faint
And the birds of air felt strangely ,
Nor thinking such a cruel shock to meet ,
He shielded himself from the father of sin ;
And darkness that you meet .
A whisper steals across this listening wood !
And shook it forth with a royal will .
But fill me with the old familiar juice ,
This morning the parson takes a drive .
With bitter drops were running o'er .
For beauty 's self to break .
With brilliance , while she dipped her jacinth beak
Of the labour that moves the world ;
The bird can sing not half it feels !
Seeing the hawk it casts itself into the snare .
When tidings come of him who marched
The yellow lights went climbing towards the sky .
May just pluck out a pretty note ;
And to his aid then motherhood was brought .
And lectures give to great and small ,
A shadow , overcame me first by wine ,
What dreadful terms belong this sacred feat ,
Or gave his father grief but when he died .
For liberty long hast thou stood ,
Then arose the notes of discord ;
The craggy glen here winds , with ivy hung ,
Of the snoring mouths which rapidly swallow .
The wet trees hang above the walks
Which the close hemlocks on the surface made ,
The ground himself had purchased with his pain ,
Of downcast length , in whose silk shadow lies
When peace hath put their pomp to sleep ;
And when that he was passed sixty year ,
To their challenge made no answer ,
The wind goes shivering with cold
What shall surround our path in paradise ?
Time pass 'd . my eldest girl was married ,
The wavering darkness swallowed the sun and moon .
In that original sin , by which all fell .
And swelling in mist it mounts a mighty cloud .
It brought to us ! we read it o'er
To give me courage , as from phase to phase
And the mouldering dust that years have made
As wave on wave of revellers swept abroad ;
When will they make a path of beauty clear
Slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet
For rich men and their brides to lay their heads
From any ties but those new days may bring ?
Oaths of homage fiercely flung ,
The rising wind was gusty yet ,
That bears a human soul !
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it .
And draw the king to thy retreat . ”
For lo ? my words no fancied woes relate ;
I see a way , have hope .
For help , deliverance will arise
That mounts the unwrinkled zenith visibly ,
Love framed with mirth a gay fantastic round :
With even the unhappy sword that gave
And darken 'd sanctities with song . "
They march , to give you sword and flame .
For fearless freedom , which none can control ,
Wrack 'd with revenge , and fury rent ,
Like some black host the shadows fall ,
That lies beyond creation ,
Had fallen . misery encompassed all ;
Hope looked for what was lost ,
Too soon the seaman 's glance , extending wide ,
Like waves that follow o'er the sea ,
We wave our farewells from the shore ,
Only returning desire knows oscillation or change .
Beat back the dread , beat down the woe ,
And ever nearer comes the light of flames ,
Truth , weeping , tells the mournful tale ,
Shall know the truth which maketh free ,
Will take the rudder and thy room supply . "
O brother , fare where life has come ,
And that subdued , despondent thought which wears
It smote earl harold over the eye ,
And hence thy surname grew . i follow 'd then
The lone , sweet lady keeps her prayer .
Of happiness come here . for on the earth
He found himself , an envoy and alone ,
From the high rampart hurled they at the foe
Oh for a burning word that would express
My lyre whereof i make my melody .
Elusive of the bridal day , she gives
Nor gave the slightest opposition ,
How swift the summer goes ,
My cheek went as red as a rose ; --
A power more strong in beauty , born of us
In this accord like cause for pleasure find ,
Twilight , a timid fawn , went glimmering by ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
A ladder of strength , or a wavering string .
Their mystic power controlled the beast , --
All this i have believed and rested on ,
Nor age or change thy limbs assail .
To our forests tell thy pain !
That his race is almost run .
Peace seems to nestle in my brain .
Before the lights we play our part ,
Still through his soul the solemn warning rang ,
Singing , in flights that played
And my heart has gone aboard her
That came , that sang through tropic trees ,
Stretched on his straw he lays himself to sleep ,
As the bugle called for war ;
That the depth of love 's generous spirit appears ;
The one that went before , holds and caresses ;
He made his way unto the tarn ,
And through an ancient town we range ,
That its music may attend me .
We got to the course with our troubles ,
The fragrance borrowed where the myrtle blooms ;
Look up to catch her glances sweet .
Bright sparks the gloom relieved ;
And foes join foes to triumph in her fall .
My days have crackled and gone up in smoke ,
In my tent his rest took he .
More curse has been hurled :
Dark shadows wove on their aerial looms
What lovers ! they give not a single caress !
Rage prompted them at length , and found them arms
Soon hurries me back to despair .
Like devils that on hid treasures sit , or those
Lest sympathy the tears provoke .
Which round immortals when enamour 'd shine ,
So deep the light that in them lies ,
Beares that huge tree which must bear him !
And on thy happy lips doth sit a joy ,
Oh , how thermometers go up !
From the sweet hills pierced the gloom ,
When all nature cries , " rejoice " ?
And here i set my face towards home ,
And when the cloud of steam had curled to meet
I resolutely shut away the past ,
Life was made for love and cheer .
Let thy whole strength go to each ,
Which makes so many poets , and some fools :
Hold to that law whereby the warring tribes
And then the way her fingers go ;
And when his injured country 's rights to shield ,
Next aethiopia 's utmost bound explore ,
Thus the ancient bard made answer :
O desolation moving with such grace !
Far other lessons christ 's apostle taught ,
The tree bore his fruit in the midsummer glow ;
Practise the art transmitted from the past ?
That , but her breathing did not fail ,
The drum gives the signal !
To it a happy name is given ;
She gives her page the blooming rose ,
My human heart returned again .
The largest ship might claim it for a mast .
Now autumn sheds her latest leaf ;
Its also darkness of the face withdrawn ,
And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth ,
When earth lay nearer to the skies
" that poet turned him first to pray
And mellowing night upon their forms descended ;
Now their good fortune gratitude begot ,
For nigh two decades spring had breathed ;
And potent to resist the freezing blast .
Give me but what this ribbon bound ,
The wind is passing through .
Bad news has come to the king ,
Before it fled fear 's pallid form ;
Shaking their dewy tresses now the storm is laid .
Soon all the world in wonder came to stare .
The dew still clings to the trees and grass ,
Within a myrtle arbor lay ,
Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore !
The wave-subduer met with scant reward .
't was life and death to meet .
With these few words i sharpened for the voyage
All who turn to it . had this text divine
Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find .
As now i recall it -- is gravely severe ,
I am the booth where folly holds her fair ;
Is lost entire , and earth is overcast
Though flower-bonds were set
To whom that island 's crown belonged of right .
Out of her happiness . the locket brought
In their vile mouths awhile such names convey ,
Seated where the wind blew softly ,
Their accents did resound .
The papers display 'd his great share of wit ,
Go sleep , and so beguile thy mind !
Still sharper rang the yelping tone ,
That sits at good king arthur 's board ;
Manifold motions making little speed ,
Their faith and might have nobly shown ,
As summer sends a mighty thrill
From the bottom took a splinter .
More purity give me ,
Approaching midnight . we have struck despair
That hangs in the palace on italy 's shore ;
How powerful one stands ! his muscles ache
And disaster cross thy pathway ;
Jasmine and honey-apple bore the banner :
Pursued the path the robber took ,
Relief he finds for others ' woes --
The old rhymes rang in the sunlit mist
About this time town used to swing so gay
To bear the gospel of eternal spring --
And one is the kiss i took from you ,
Gave to retain the unseparated soul :
The white clouds spread themselves across the sky ,
The violets whisper from the shade
His struggling limbs still rooted in the plain ;
To spend ourselves , and never count the cost ,
Was the first counsel that was given by christ .
But there came no other answer
I read springtime eternal in your eyes !
Who gave his life to keep it going round ?
It sounds as it might tell
His brown cheek flushed with healthful exercise ,
Though your manner does not show it .
Death feeds upon him , pity is no more ,
't is liberty 's bold note i swell ,
Shook the dim city -- as that answer rang !
In the air the boughs extended ,
A fire from your high altar shines ,
Who felt that christ indeed had risen again .
The tide swings gray and the clouds sway ,
And the water will run where the drink went ;
So comes the captive soul into desire ,
And crooked shapes of terror crouched ,
Prone as prone seas that break and drown
For his soul 's comfort find her good ,
Eyes fixed or fevered , pale or bloodred mouth ,
Whose heart fed mine has passed into the past .
The grief that marks our dawning youth
Naught shall revive thy vanished spark . . .
My threatened fate , it chilled my blood ,
As the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung ,
The flowers she from the wild-hedge takes --
There shone a sudden flash of dark surmise ,
Fretted for news that made him fret again ,
Where mystery like the veil by beauty worn
All the torment it hath wrought :
That breathes familiar scent of many a flower ,
Which add a holy horror to the grove .
Of that sin into which i now must fall ,
And death must dig the level where these agree .
The star-spangled banner bring hither ,
And love is lit by the breath of sighs ;
Can be harmony when the notes properly fit :
And tender colours touched the sky ,
Like red roses shone their faces ,
Intent to slay him ere he reach his home ,
The dusk came down ; and like a ghost
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not .
“ for thrice three nights forbidden things they held .
Children like me in age , whose years were filled
Whose every blast some dire contagion brings ,
With glowing feelings , and face clad in smiles .
-- with the next noon his morning came ,
Thoughts of it my vitals burn ;
Nor on that faithless bank securely tread ;
And by going wrong all things come right ;
And took himself for pay .
Nature demanding recompense for hours
His offering brings and cares not at what shrine
Whose law hath shaped the pebbles on the shore ,
Men dying make their wills -- but wives
That lingers in the garden there .
And the may came on in her charms ,
The panting liver pours a flood of gore
But the wind from the north -- bringing snow .
Her mural breach , returning whence it rowld .
If i see but sorrow ?
Struggled to clasp her , down the image fell ,
Hath not some grieving drawn him
Who , moving others , are themselves as stone ,
Earth breaks up , time drops away ,
And humbly his alliance sought ;
Now when the dead man come to life beheld
It would give me joy unceasing
" are lent to cover frauds like these .
And buckler 'd warriors issued his commands .
To run away " or raise a row .
Each trembling eye-lash moved with thought ,
I matched with scotland 's heathery hills
The summer comes wi ' rosy wreaths ,
Scarce any blood came through , )
But what when their fresh splendours close ?
The dove of peace shall rest ;
As if mere chance had placed it there ;
And when it 's broken , i become a scourge
As messengers lie , with the facts alone ,
No gods were there , — dismiss the thought
But read her thought to speed the race ,
In icy chains the streams are bound ,
Since earth was put over aed .
Though always at my words his trouble grew ;
Evermore shall keep thee waking ,
Our sweetheart , spring , came softly ,
Is all the crown and glory that it asks .
The young man went to woo a wife .
The world is filled with gladness ;
And now to wondrous acts his will inclined ;
As a sick child waking sees
Are those , which make thee beat thy wings below
And toronto troops gained fame
From the pressing weight of roof and gable ;
And place his clansmen in array .
By your elimination stands to-day ,
Certain death will overtake thee . "
For the man 's hoary anguish draws and presses
Jumbled the notes like wavelets flowing
A portal arch unfolded wide .
At what my words would bring :
As to prometheus , bringing ease
The flowers do fade , and wanton fields
Will bring enough of sorrow . "
When summer comes rejoicing
And when again its well-known music thrilled ,
A sacred laurel springing from my grave :
Was that he set the poor against the rich ,
With coldness still returning .
Such dreams as these come night by night ,
And wings the soul with boundless flight to soar ,
Summer and sunshine will follow you fast .
No credence would he gain from trojan men ,
Have in this year of agony built up
His life was nursed in beauty , like the stream
The sun hung molten in mid space ,
Of ganelon who wove the treason 's plot .
Lest his pay for a week should be stopped .
There virtue reigns as queen in royal throne ,
There through the silken hush come footfalls faint
To bid me reverence or regard the gods .
And branches where the summer draws to head .
Of parting day yet lingered on the stream ,
That touched the shafts of wavering fire
To keep those pious principles in force .
O'er stock and rock their race they take .
Then was her tender soul with anguish torn ,
And a vision hovered near him --
The luring eddy lies behind
See now his blood begins to pour ; and see
Whom its wild desire would persuade to passion ?
And yet the landscape wears a pleasing hue .
The need that men feel to create and believe ,
And life to me wore less
That spring is come again .
Thy morning ray went down !
The regiment will rise in mutiny ,
Come on ! come on ! my merry men ,
Come on , cigars round , rum for mine ,
Charged with the mournful load , to ilion go
And god stretched forth his finger as he heard
And the sky is held in the water .
Garden airs went sweetly up , heaven smiled down ;
That friendship soon in gentle heart is bred .
This carouse at sariola held ?
From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round
There comes upon your hour of thought ,
And let hem make for the werre , -
And the signs promise peace with liberty ,
Like the eyes of wolves glared at them !
And in gentle cloudlets chase ;
Was wrought the fairest facing she could make .
The marble image stirred with life ,
Then dark discomforts would give place to joy ,
She would not hold the burying ! " ...
The stern decrees of fate may shun .
Haste , from the sultry lawn the flocks remove
Finding his steed , the knight put question :
In low lament the answer died .
And sees the law its work pursue .
Whose merit dare apply it ,
Shall bloom for ever . so the foul shall speed
And open up the gates of prescience .
Shook every sorrow memory bore from earth :
Raise thee in spirit nigher unto heaven !
Shall curse the chance that brought him here --
Tells how these lips speak oft with god alone .
While far as sight can reach beneath as clear
The rose that tells me things ?
Never was blast from vapour charged with cold ,
May floats in fragrance on the breeze .
It might have graced a rosy bower ,
The dizzy pathway to a wanderer gave ;
Nor much defence could make the moorish lord ;
Which mocked its victims in that hour of fear ,
We draw our life ; a sense that makes
And the first freedom moved upon the deep ,
And fly where joy alone shall find ye . '
And pride and pity move me to thy part :
Five scymitars , wi ' murder crusted ;
That blossoming fair our house may stand ? "
How to secure his sword and by what skill ,
To question , nor myself could aught discern ,
Cause me to blow my horn , to bring disgrace
O lips that mine have grown into
To hold the race as i their fathers held ,
Vain , worthless words , or idle promise bred .
He had endured them in the days just gone .
Learning what nature and solitude teach ,
For all his art breathes melody , and tunes
In sympathy they give the soul ,
But let the latins still retain their name ,
O the joy of the breath she sustains ,
That warmed the hearts around it met ,
O , trust the hope these tokens give :
Your memory covers earth and sky ; i yearn
In the cradle of nature the young spring lies
Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led . "
From which he drinks such joy as doth a pale
Meshes that go with your caresses ,
So that of both one counsel sole i made .
May make you laugh on t ' other side .
Along the coast their mingled clamours ran ,
Christ is come to be my king ,
The hollow caves return a hollow moan .
Fainted his spirit . leeches sought to allay
The fallen fortunes , and the desolation
And stand aside for scotland 's pride -
Their rent and tribute soon will bring . ”
Than all truths born of time ;
All things proceed , and up to him return ,
But this faith which i maintaine .
France goes rolling all around ,
Till billows rage , and gales blow hard ,
The rain smites more and more ,
And horror chilled his soul !
Of lines that flow voluptuously
What shall we do when hope is gone ? "
Of tiny flames are flaring on the hills ;
The flood of ages combating below ,
Nature 's changeless decree has allotted its share
Shall lead you home to the fold ...
Now of his failures is a triumph made ;
With sunset glories girt around his loins ?
And every day they gave their toll of dead --
When death draws near , so people say ,
But that success attends him ; if mishap ,
A courage they had never shown before .
Then from amaze into delight he fell
But standing forth in false forms or in true ,
On the sad cross bought me with bitter death ,
While we dream the flower will strengthen ,
And lapped the soul in an elysium
Give pain as well as pleasure .
Even thus a heart once by your music thrilled ,
Peace comes with fighting with the strength of ten ,
And froze the genial current of the soul .
Through a waste void the soulless atoms run ,
Which turning to the fire he bade them heave .
Long since its strength was given
Now hear what blessings temperance can bring :
The pain of leaving which he had to face .
The miles of houses pocketed in the valley beyond --
With you their watches keep .
Better to meet the death-conducted ball ,
The goods committed into fortune 's hands ,
Courtiers give place before the stride
Its curving lines that fill the sight ,
For fame he ’ll risk his life with pleasure .
Against this numbing sorrow strive ,
Would sometimes make thee think thyself !
That brings their sure decay :
That full of beauty time bestows upon her .
Made it settle on the war-ship
Calling war upon his bugle ,
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
And now was casting dust upon his head ,
What voice came through the sacred air ? --
The worst is yet to come ;
Trodden in vain till he regain the path .
The market glutted and his counted profits naught .
Inhales her fragrance , as he hangs in air ,
Death dawned ; heaven lay in prospect wide : -
Or god and nature meant to mere mankind ,
That they in heaven may highest sit . "
Oh , what if a sound should be made !
Her hieroglyphic meanings which elude ;
For it the real to the ideal tends .
One is , if you puts on a tax ,
In valor 's desperation reared ,
Loaded with death , that other scale descends .
The world will little note nor long remember
Then bharat ’s army nearer drew :
As , wrapped in hazy waves of shimmering light ,
The wind comes heavy freighted from the wood ,
Seeking its perished joy in vain ?
I see the doom my favour 'd foes decree ,
Yet go with light and life
And tell of the signs you shall shortly see ;
The fountain of perpetual peace flows there --
Finding the english forcing their retreat ,
The night of tyranny hath settled o'er
Art hardly told us where they lay ,
And yet by love my wretched heart was moved
Which , when to patience grown ,
And england 's wealth around him flows ;
Or backers take the bet ,
This racks the joints , this fires the veins ,
Of devastation , but the hazels rose
And takes half animate the air ,
Forbidding the passions contend .
To all , promiscuous , as they pass :
The very she called forth by ripened blood
Long have i laboured to elude thy sway --
With trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace ,
Five scimitars , wi ' murder crusted ;
Taught the waves her yoke to bear ,
Nor love , whose anguish only learned to last .
Giving thee an air that 's somewhat better fitted
The one had seen three summers smile
And with our oars keep time ,
Let now the voice of joy prevail ,
Should bharat , raised as king to sway
Let them drop down the golden atmosphere ,
" oppose proud britain 's tyrant sway ,
The priest went on his knees to pray .
Which comes to pass each moment of our lives ?
Flies flashing , leaps his heart with languid fear ?
And scared , and lacerated for their cure --
My travels thence through spacious greece extend ;
And they gave him greeting loud .
That suit , and bound refusal with an oath --
Bliss has fulfilled its measure ,
Let him then all his fear dismiss ,
And bustling chanticleer proclaimed the dawn .
Had shown to other men the perfect day ?
With peace-white banners waving free ,
And i know what no seraphs shall gain !
Who up a sapling made him clear .
The stroke a wound in her weak bosom made .
Their voices keep pace with their quickening speed :
Even though severely love 's pains i feel ;
And soft receives him from the rolling sea .
Morning and evening opened and closed above me :
Born , grown , and fitted for the toil .
Then , to reform , he took a wife ,
Until his heart with boundless joy would swell
Of all the things the varied year had brought .
And the fame that now hangs o'er him ,
For he sells the thing that never can come ,
There the first roses of the year shall blow ;
Shews from what source our fine sensations rise ;
That wisdom infinite must form the best ,
To bring those far-off scenes so near
Then thought of fair almira , and took heart
That tremble made the everlasting air .
Come to the first things ,
For such lone haunts and contemplation made .
Than autumn leaves , she watched it as it came
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand ,
Such little signs should serve wild creatures
Which made its orbit with the lesser arc .
These too will yield a pleasant tale to tell .
And forms the dance responsive to the strings ,
For blushes , give me red , nor hesitate
That ends the worlds , he glowed in ire ,
Then a deathly spell on the watchers fell --
The nightingale that in the branches sang ,
Then there came distress upon him ,
To get speech of that lily-wand .
Blinded with weeping for the sad and poor ;
A peace swept down , and left it whole .
O happy spirits , marked by god and man
A height his finite reason can not reach ,
My soul takes ship for the avalon
Loving that one lost heart until they die ,
Their salutary counsel gave :
And threaded the mazy quadrille .
In its case it lay compactly ,
That hailed my father 's fame ;
With growing brightness , and he softly said :
The skulls and bones would make me cringe ,
My heart wi ' joy did knock ,
Our thoughts were captive held by sad foreboding . --
For men have moods which to their acts imply
This is the mother who put on its case ,
And the age hears its muster-call ,
Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh ,
With here and there a creek , whose aspect wore
With my sharp spear will his assault receive .
The cord that held the cross about his neck ,
And the road across it ran .
Answered in the words which follow :
A lightning sent from sinai and a gleam
The left still pointing to the prey ,
Despite the rains , the mists that roll ,
Nor have the heart that dois me pain .
My jerry there has left the sea
Warm night shall sink and utterly persuade
Watched , noting down each prayer he made ,
From the floor the child made answer :
Dear , hardy lover , keep your faith and stay
I studied the calculus to build .
And takes its bliss beyond the body 's reach ,
I aim at in the following story : --
The north , came riding on the wind ,
Its discords , quenched by meeting harmonies ,
Through human hearts , by love of him controlled ,
Wild beats my heart to trace your steps ,
To wreck what god in mercy saves ,
While seas roll on in laughter .
O god , take the sun from the sky !
So the lady transacts all the business alone ,
Which their own leaves have made :
Fire flashed from his fur-cloak 's borders ,
And the high strain gained sweetness from thy voice .
What shepherd can express . 9 .
It made him whistle , it made him sing ;
That made me breathe a prayer upon the spot --
The sorrow of the world cries out for hope .
Youth lightly shadowed by young womanhood !
The king , which reson understod
’ twas time the naming rite to hold .
Fair love to roland and the others show .
Of war moved towards us sullenly .
To new appearance . meeting these , there came ,
And bacchus , shedding rosy smiles ,
Flashing and sparkling as it run .
False was the treacherous tale he gave , --
The tears which came to matthew 's eyes
Once stay ’d achilles , rushing to the war .
We only ask for sunshine ,
No blame upon rogero should be cast ;
That he was watching when such joys were brought .
That covers all he has brought
And sing , o purple pennons that unfold
Though a foul mind the lady 's actions speak ,
Which hope to see a covert murder done .
With every charm that mineral scenes display ,
About their shoulders dash the plenteous spray ,
And often found life 's hopes to stand
Ghost-flux of faces that hie
Patience with manly courage join 'd ,
But the song dies away into only one note ,
And have sought , to give new birth ,
And horrors , snarling at each crowd ,
When swift fleets would urge their way ,
And eyes with tears are aching ,
His hand laid softly on that shining head .
The knave to mend his fortune sues ,
His pleasures with thee wrought .
While agamemnon wastes the ranks around ,
But the purple gift it was thine to give
They never yet saw fairer play .
And o'er the dying 's ear has gone
And place my joys where my desires would be .
And so their guiltless blood they spill . ”
He 'd sparked it with full twenty gals ,
The truth , an ' fix the final seal .
The scenes and fates which lie secluded there ;
Outside the world goes laughing lest it weep ,
To us that blessedness he brings ,
Swift fall the blows , and men upbraid ,
In hatred far beyond what justice willed .
The days are gone when sword and poet 's pen
Immortal thy charms remain .
Has made us laugh until we cried ,
On aphrodite 's passing follow hard ;
He heard the bows that bauldly ring ,
With a wild pathos borrowed of his wrong
And found new shores , and sylvan settlements ,
None to guard their final slumber .
If it be not a way of laying hold
Her path ran by a rushing stream
Of young rinaldo 's worth and praises came :
Hard his breath came through his nostrils ,
And thronging serfs their lords pursue .
Whose open palms were nailed toward heaven
With cheers swelling and swelling , to run and turn
In pangs ; and nature gave a second groan ;
A song that had brought anchors out of seas
The imperative chorus rises sonorous and fell :
Bless thou thy lot ; thy simple strains have led
We strike them as they stand at bay ,
Rather to him some time had borne despite ;
Onward and onward careering they go ,
And their tails like fans unfolded .
To lay pale hands upon her shoulders . . .
What is it worth that wisdom does not scorn ?
My prayer to the promise shall cling --
Lasts , though all the worlds lie waste
Nor of the dead who rise upon our dreams ,
While life remains to it prepared to outface
And set him up a deity ;
Where many inward sighs were spent
For soon the contrary was made appear .
Wrenched wrinkled features met my sight ,
An ambush hoped , as heartless night remain .
Till comes the last successive tyke ,
The glorious beauty of his face would shine .
And is himself that great sublime he draws .
The radiant image of his glory sat ,
But wo n't flow now until a thaw .
A woven silence , or but came to cast
For this union it doth join
My spirit stirs , my streaming tears still run ,
And as a queen disguised might pass anear
Both his eyeballs flashing lightning ;
Is now an iron rod to bruise and breake
And in the greenwood leave their bodies lone .
I know how , ere her green is shed ,
" o soul that goest to beatitude
There take my gage , behold i offer it
Which , seeking not the praise of art ,
And opening to the dame the thought he brewed ,
Which shook the waves and rent the sky ! --
But they took the trail with a laugh ,
The while they cool themselves , they freshness give ,
In bliss of bliss , where they bring to god
The ship , unable to pursue her way ,
Shall a ready answer make us .
The warrior pair who tamed the foe ,
Follow his lordship . he must be unwell .
The nostrils , then and there it puts to sleep
Lest they should break the compact they had made .
Is now the highway where stand thy proud arches ,
Who dares to meet his naked heart alone ;
And yawned and stumbled and lost their places .
For the old country first will care .
Proof and to spare . a thousand shadows rose
Chill as a dull face frowning on a song .
And bless each pang that gave me back
And climbing , in the summit took his place ;
The blasting vollied thunder made all speed ,
Of the crowded songs that fill it ,
Long time in dread suspense the strife remains ,
The pathway made glorious , with shoutings victorious
And wings to joy to reach a heavenly height ;
Should e'er have given such beauty birth ! --
Give we the silent night to needful rest :
As the chill waters o'er the pebbles stray .
That forced them late cease from their noble war ,
And those reports for lies and fables hold .
And sorrow 's faded form , and solitude behind .
As if that soul were fled .
Thus reversed his words of magic ,
Fearing lest his strength should fail him ,
Verdict found , and sentence passed .
Still stuck in _ betty 's _ doubtful throat ,
And straight the vision fled . a female next
On the coast the waters left it .
And at each other homely taunts they threw .
Your face wears furrows untold . "
Next , charged with all his implements of art ,
But a little time passed over ,
The dark page lifted up his indian eyes
Bright from afar the city shines
A sect whose chief devotion lies
When i such a glory might see !
It might , what nature never gives the young ,
The sun slipped westward . that peculiar change
Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way ,
Thy strength had propped the tottering throne :
With its crowded cabins pale .
A bard dejected the train was guiding ,
Like a sweet snake 's breath made more poisonous
Chastity , her breasts she laid
But a leaf that lingered brown ,
Be told that had the poet chanced to start
Where the suns and stars are wrought ?
And helen breathed the scent of violets , blown
And life in death laid the heart bare ? --
The original version added here the following :
Good old human race that keeps on multiplying !
In terror turned the tiny man ,
Ablution in bright tepid baths perform 'd .
Highest of all , where white peaks glanced ,
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes .
Shadows and shoals that edge eternity .
Usurping , as thou downward driftest ,
The spirit race that come at poet 's call ,
He rises like the god of day .
To shake my soul with fears --
In oneness rise to quench the doubt .
Believing , as he makes his fight
Each morn emerging from the ambient main ,
And makes life 's current smoothly run .
Up to the skies my talents late hath cried ;
But other scenes did charms display ,
For copes , which gave us great content ;
Who for a sparrow 's death dissolve in tears ,
They seek the lotus and end life 's thrall .
Of the fear that followed ; ever again
He came my coral kiss to meet ,
Too tart the fruit it brought !
No wight so poor but may his tatters lose ,
Then news unto leeve london came
The might of rome drew nigh beneath the wall
This lentulus , and this made him resist
In heaven we place a manly trust ,
And rained soft kisses on my lips and brow ,
Not a word passed of love all our lifetime ,
Could not give him greater knowledge .
Still waters , moving crystals , sands of gold ,
Where ye for men twist shredded thought like paper ,
The merit years of toil have bought .
And now the trumpet makes the still air quake ,
Whence comes its sweet , elusive odor rare , --
The mask of earth lies dim and dead ,
She gives them pleasant dreams ,
Nor breath was drawn , amid the observant crew :
I feel as lonely as can be .
The way his soul shall go .
With death 's mysteries enfolded .
In what he gives to thee , this paradise
I rose from dreamless hours and sought the morn
We 've proved ourselves fit for the vote !
When of the banks their leave they take ,
Have sapped the leaning walls of life ,
That trembles in a forest place
We cast the shapes of holiness and sin .
When her eyes found me calm and free ;
Put to sleep my mother 's curse ?
Till everything he loved was gone .
To whom its moral will was given .
It passed to god . the music was
My mourning rights to sever .
Save when with gray eyes lifted to the moon ,
Where never mountain tipt its head with snow ?
This was the verdict given :
Breaking the clouds where it was nurst ,
Rolled the ever changing seasons ,
And time , to heal the old distress
Where darkness sat upon the living waters ,
Your fairy building grow .
The summer next ( those blossoms blown )
Signal 's given ; his soul has fled !
Which in forest coverts stay .
Have vanished like bubbles that burst on the shore .
He shone on people like the sun ,
This yearning ache that he had held so long
The humid hushing wind that ranges still
And these immortal eyes shed tears --
Can make the sun appear the moon ,
Bright over europe fell her golden hair .
And garlands on the hollow spaces lie .
Authoritative of that elder , sprang
But old things held ; the laughter ,
With terror rose and disappeared ;
That marks a high and princely line ,
Once your gentle hands have made it .
Their armour helped their harm , crushed in and bruised
Whose soul is still prepared for death ,
And august came the fainting year to mend
Meantime bids seek for female vest and gown .
And reason broke what passion formed .
Let thankfulness be found in me ,
If the powerful beams that fly
I feel thee near once more .
Until their very number makes men hard
Like some proud bull , that round the pastures leads
For storms will rise , as many know ,
With all their banners bravely spread ,
Passion can give it ; sometimes wine inspires
The wasted sweetness of the rose ;
Even the rough soldier 's heart was moved ;
And ever comes joy back again .
King priam added , and two sons she bore
Or using playfulness deep sobs would plow
She thrilled to feel him take and hide
The water turn to wine :
The tears his love had shed .
The roses , faded and gone by ,
Than a delusion ; if it be , whence came
The wild sea gentler moved --
That neither tongue nor pen could follow it .
But lo ! there surges forth a shriek ,
Centuries passed , and his hair became curlier ;
The monster moving onward came as fast ,
Floated and flashed beneath the shadowy palms ;
Still follows thee , still follows thee .
Fierce raged the consumer insatiate and strong ,
That never again would beam on you .
Me from our coast shall spreading sails convey ,
They ran their last career , then each display 'd
Such heavy blows on their polls he laid .
And cull the hues of loveliest flowers ,
A child at length arrives at never ending birth .
The prey might take alarm and run ashore ,
Can trouble live with april days ,
I hold with those who favor fire .
Which on his troubled soul had lain .
His smile when rang their proud hurrah ,
But pass in gloom your silent lives away ;
But here or there as strikes the player goes ;
Wonder and joy ran thrilling to his heart ;
Losing her woes in shows of discontent .
Low the poor ship leaned on the tide :
That trance is brightly broken ! glossy trees ,
And their long dark shadows behind them are cast ,
The sky lies on its wrong side .
A chosen senate from the people draws ;
To keep two hearts together , that began
The love that i shall never see "
The violated myrtle ran with gore .
Vale of tears ascend to joy ?
Then glorious lakshmaṇ took the buck
And set me as a seal upon thine arm ;
That they may not find misfortune ,
She was nearly blown away .
From nature 's hands came kind , affectionate ;
From their trembling twigs comes a dry laughing ,
With thee the wildest tempests play ,
For spring at last has come ,
Death lays his icy hands on kings ;
His goodly arms : but now against him came
The comfort that this day doth bring ;
Nor force nor fraud could turn my steps aside ;
The church 's prayer finds wings to soar ,
And roman triumphs rising on the gold .
And all his comet stole away by night .
Scamps may leave their task unfinished ;
She had follow 'd by chance ,
With envious dark rage i bear ,
And merchants wants in merchants words express .
I found historians recording truth ;
" whence came that stain about your mouth
My body was as fire that shone ;
The shining peaks of fame that wore the sun ,
Whose trance-like stillness wakes delicious pain .
That steals unto my side to tell
There , too , flames burn and flicker .
Then there came a day
How now that holy cherche is went ,
Now rosy may comes in wi ' flowers
Though all its splendor could not chase away
Deserted of all creatures did she feel ,
By which those hours of peace were given ;
He 'll see how thanksgiving arouses
Which the night 's frolic did sustain , }
I turned to the evening cloud --
Some plasters would have served the band
Mists they met our battle-flood :
Infinity to dwell .
Three lawyers ' tongues turned inside out ,
His last sad word struck sore ;
E'en at the dinner table did it shine .
The maples set the shining fields ablaze .
The hands that can not clasp for life ,
And back from the sight in horror they shrunk .
That made the breeze to blow !
And sett it forth in the same happy place ,
No light of the moon fell on it ,
Was turned to other men .
Is built ; and therefore substance it intends .
Till our bent backs seem breaking as we go ,
Her youth renewed in such as thee :
And pour down folly on the whirling dance .
It all was wrought by word and charm ;
And north , where the tides run free ,
They will put pence on your grey eyes ,
Their old , familiar carols play ,
So that his elements have grown so fine
His sword ( that dripped by me and swung )
And the interest it might yield .
Laerces ’ valiant offspring led the last .
Among the crushed , hurt lilies lay the stone .
That joins to immortality thy name .
Of waves by dashing waters met .
Raging grief he can not smother ,
So let him stand , brother to every man ,
No wrong to make right ;
Until no sorrow now can make me weep --
Musings , which waste what they recall .
The whole creation leaves in human hearts !
Shall look to heaven from whence it came ,
The flesh soon sucks in putrefaction .
With rapid course descending to the fight ;
Darkly and scornfully glaring on him , said
Was the touch of the tongue that licked his hand
The flesh must creep , and woes are deep ,
Her garden 's histories tell of to all near .
Nor had the boaster ever risen more ,
Four churches joined in harmony ,
All selfish thoughts were merged in one wild fear
And show that only order is release .
Why not make bright blue eyes ?
Strangles the fainting passing tone ;
And what made this the more inexpressible ,
Who holds all worldly riches in her claws . '
Follow 'd with benediction . since to part ,
To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark 'd !
Which made his cousin happiest .
So it stands in our old records ,
As well as the times would allow :
Became a clock , and still adhered .
And doubt mocked at the dwindling light :
Save but the dull , dead , muffled tread
So first found healing , poisonous as it poured ;
And mortal pulses beat the tune
Te us they as examples stand ,
This guilty deed will bring thine end . ”
Entrusted squadron mighty prowess showed ;
Now high and low , where leaves renew ,
And the raft drifted down the waves of dread .
I sank my soul upon a sea of dreams ;
Certain death will overtake thee . "
An earth at quake , to quiet stamped ;
Th ' ethereal people ran , to hear and know
Or give such order , then , with added cords
There lies the other half of what was once
Silence persisted within , for sleep lay heavy on all
That so lately this passion within her hath grown .
Not once had demon jealousy crept in
The vital sap then rising from below .
Might ask a whole day 's patience .
“ expelled from power the woods i tread ,
And every one his labor found .
This pious artifice soon found success --
If from a living thing it came ,
The blood ran black from every english heart
But feel the shock renewed , nor can efface
And slowly eats his way against the wind ;
Now round us spreads the watery plain --
The wheelbarrow broke , my wife got a fall ,
" when you can fight for victory sweet ,
And little deemed their force to feel ,
The clear , full harmony of which displays
Trust him to the hand that made him .
I traced the whole terrestrial round ,
Whence take the proof that things enlarge and feed
Will we give battle to the host of greece .
She can find a nobler theme for song
Comes with his stately stride .
And he turned his eyes to north-west ,
To his heart down went the brand .
Their hearts brave the four oceans ,
Till the whole circle of the year goes round :
" she feels for the spring in the hidden panel
Those agonizing assaults which no flesh wholly can escape ;
With forceful strength a branch the hero rends ;
With chalice pale , which thin stalk bore
And ragged clothes , went by .
Its doctrine follows after my discourse ,
The marble race , that smiled on me ,
How solemn is the stillness ! nothing stirs
Prepared i stand : he was but born to try
And rumor of voices passing to and fro ,
Unraveled from the reel of time ,
And humanity 's clamour , lost , lost ;
Thou by some other shalt be laid as low :
Thus stand between thee and the works of god .
To mutual hurt , by gusts of passion driven ,
His arch bright eye provoked the smile it found ;
Then gathering heart against his fear .
Will idly shine upon and slowly melt ,
At length raised maimuna her thoughtful eyes ,
She 'd take the very devil at his word .
Climbs ever westward till it meets the sky ,
As now the cloud which seems dispersed . '
Till eternity has gone ,
Far from achilles wafts the winged death :
And freedom , only which the wise intend ,
Peering and moaning it stands .
And earth , in many forms reveal ; and through
Beyond the shifting cold twilight ,
Each life 's unfulfilled , you see ;
Our youth shall fix some festive day ,
With brightening heart he bears it on ,
For lust of him who gave one yell and fell
Love that 's lived a year .
Nay , no such violence our thoughts intend ,
Good ladies , help to fill my mourning voice .
And forward sprang to battle with the greeks ;
Cast all sorrow from thy bosom --
Before it taketh fright and shrinks away .
And french was just the man to turn it .
Who sought your friendship ere the war began !
Against the dangers that beset your path ;
For he makes the regular to thrive .
A port , not like to this ye see ,
Presently to me it ran ,
For in her path there lay
That , nature gives ; and where the lesson taught
Who held them in derision .
And thick and heavy grows the work of death :
Answered in the words which follow :
The heralds quell 'd the tumult ; reverend sat
He plunged into the gulf which heaven foretold . "
And to the mark my arrow sped .
Since the mind to deceit it might lend ;
And ( as i gathered from a bystander )
No congress or senates would meddle with me .
And honour linger ere it leaves the land .
We 've never cast receipts away !
As this spacious house was building ,
Bring unto thee the perfect prayer :
On which the enchanter charms and witchcraft said .
Whose heart shall move him to encounter sole
I give you daily my whole heart ,
And slowly crawl ( summer has made me stronger )
Upon their murderous errand flew :
Did my conductor draw me , saying : " ask
Why heed the wheels that pass ?
And step for step they followed dancing ,
With ponderous mace they waged the daring fight .
Here rises the fluid and attaching character ,
When evening is cooling the sweltering town ,
It was laid in the curse of the womb ,
And , flashing through the foliage , fruits or flowers
They melt , they vanish from my eyes .
( his gown discharged , his money spent ,
And sacred vows and mystic song applied
Who bade on till the hundreds reach 'd eleven ;
Unto the sound of the true words expressed .
Nor fear to make thy worship less divine ,
Make things secure ,
" thy blood meanwhile the penalty shall pay
There silence speaks , and shade gives light :
God knows what end the strife will take .
E'en cities sapped by the usurping spread
Recalling what remarkably had passed
Dew his handsome eyes was washing .
Grief trod the grapes of joy for wine ,
Our mightiest shall take ambush . let the host
But close about him her fair arms she wound ,
Yet , ere that leaf shall fall and fade ,
And talked with wife , and traded family views ,
And faint a hidden pain her hot heart stirred ,
Which tell of crimes now daily brought to light ,
The holy saints their favour lend ,
Nor did more learning ever crowded lie
Lifted the azure light of earnest eyes ,
And vengeance writes itself upon each face ;
Their bosoms burn with fierce desires ,
Asleep will lay thee , till thine eye
And in thy joyous errand reach the spot
A fair white fleece of cloud , which swiftly climbed
Where death 's pale shade is resting now ; --
Trophies hang in ares ' honor ,
With honour and all care remained .
Time yet hath reverenced ; and i deeply feel
Each some magic song suggested .
The goddess laid ; loud rang the wondrous work .
The vapor rises , silver-eyed ,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim , --
And the before great now makes unknown .
Can ever dissever the good from the bad
And threading the eye of a yellow star :
Of the green sea swept freely far and wide ,
Nor showed the least alarm .
Both going home , both looking for rest .
Leave thee naked to laughter ,
His peaceful moments ran ;
To make fools hate them , only by disguise ;
Ten times a hundred ’s force possessed .
Make way for spring , for she has no pity
Where the wanderer falls dejected ,
Where the river of longing whispered ...
So little life can cast into the scale .
" we 'll bear the pall . "
To tempt the dangers of forbidding night ?
Atrides setting fast his heel , tore off
Should ladies fair be tied to such hard laws ,
Charm 'd , sir , to find your road lies
To shew his own superior parts ,
His glen the burn goes singing through ;
And now i feel the muse sublime
O faith , that meets ten thousand cheats
Of moral prudence , sought through good and ill ;
Soon found his astonishment merged in delight ;
When it swept through thy branches wide .
Familiar eyes gazed from profound sea-caves ,
The lights are burning low . do you not feel
Making all the world seem hopeless ,
No , my heart has never tired of you .
What folly for a satire meant ,
Whatever bellies hungered and went dry ,
In all the joys my selfish aims have brought ,
Whom god makes lonely ,
And word goes back to the weary wife
And when youth with its glowing visions came ,
All warsaw gather 'd round his gates
Thy virtue , fancying in thee to find
Despair , to thee i bow ,
For thee whole nations filled with flames and blood ,
Full many a year has passed since then ,
Could make a gentle belle reject a lord ?
And flooded the plain with her mellow light .
Who only deal in learned prose :
First to himself he inward silence broke .
The petals in the moon did shake .
As though they caught a broken clue ;
Nay , even if creeping time should hide the skies
On duties well performed , and days well spent !
And rue which spoke of some heart 's bitterness .
She puts on outward strangeness , seems unkind ,
What centuries could not fulfill ,
Was the prayer which then ascended ,
Each thing of price he saw ,
And that still depth of passion learns
Ingratitude sticks to his mind , --
Beyond us some short space , in answer came .
And joined , indulgent , in the merriment ...
The aching hope , the trembling pangs she feels .
With fatal , fatal love a girlhood goes .
Hateful tones assail the ear .
Red shone the angry scar
I should see the sun flashing from his sword hilt
Who made companions of these serving maids ,
And trembling ague in each member lies :
The shadow of disgrace shall fall , instead
Peace is our portion . yet a whisper rose ,
The westering sun had low declined ,
Its petals gave all their sweet to me ,
His thoughts and war 's rough ills assuage :
The day being spent , we homeward went
Terror and death glared where he went ;
The star that shook above the eastern hill
It got to a pitch , when the hand indeed
His mother 's voice went forth ;
For france , for france the franks are bound .
And thus replied by passion spurred :
So runs our loyal dream of thee ;
So the warning words went forth
From jesse 's root behold a branch arise ,
The play is done ; the curtain drops ,
Each amorous thought was rudely stilled ,
To pledge itself the issue , wavered now :
And joy unmixt is hard to gain .
The dream of all my glory was undone , --
Into my bosom and be lost in me . '
And twined by her he loves the best .
Contemplate here the wonder i unfold .
And closed him in on every side ,
And give to rapture all thy trembling strings .
So music has come where the silence was :
Until we met the solid town ,
Answered in the words which follow :
O who could bear life 's stormy doom
That to my will gave wings ; and i began
" god give damnation unto thee who thus
This flaming hill , and on his body threw .
And there lies gude sir patrick spens ,
Lifted the azure light of earnest eyes
Bids one majestic harmony resound ?
When days were turned to years .
Till like soup spread out the iron ,
Athirst for sway , her hopes are crossed ,
Here are the tired limbs springing lightly
Tear-worn and troubled with many scars ,
In flame and steel she voiced her thought --
From clay and stone , with silent triumph throws
For fame , that can nothing hide ,
Souls of his temper were not made for ease ,
And giveth happiness or peace ,
A mighty fortress while the world had slept ,
Like that which kept the heart of eden green
This put poor frog in a terrible fright ,
They suddenly felt the wind blow cold ,
When hunger came she turned her breast
Which brought discredit on san luis rey ,
Champagne will bathe the heart a while in bliss ,
And higher meanings came to common words ,
Where her own blood now was flowing ;
Might be allowed some fear from such a cause .
Fill the air with an odor as sweet
Torn from a seraph 's wing in sinful weather ,
To whom the power is given to know
Were menalippus ' temples gnawed and hacked
If not outward helpes she find ,
To swell the tide of hours forever gone .
Would feel a trifle disconcerted ,
That she may see to work , poor soul ,
The doubts that in his heart arose : and now
That sprinkled winding ocean 's lowly verge ,
Free pleasure comes and goes beneath the skies .
He started , shuddering , and drew breath to see
I 'd freely give to be elected now
Till time has struck the letters of one word --
Or what embraces e'er possess such charms ?
Who bore for truth the pangs of birth ,
Exclaiming , drew me towards him from the place ,
God gives to souls unworldly , pure .
Of a silence which suited his purpose so well .
The scant allowance , that our tyrants bore .
Would never shed the blood of innocence .
Vague echoes borne beneath the moon 's pale ray
So ran the tale like fire about the court ,
The law is planted , to abide .
The dismal smoke-house walls began to shine :
Ring fainter and fainter . silence falls
There wandering yakshas found delight ,
Our fortune to harden , they show castle garden --
About my elenor , you 'd find them saying
Had streaked the eastern hill .
The singers of the past can yield .
Though his heart rose enraptured he could not but feel
To every wight that has its counsel sought .
And makes the mass 'd clouds roll ,
Some strive to gain the smiles of men ,
My love 's full tide goes sweeping on its course
Light and life to all he brings ,
That they give their fairest treasure ,
Which yet lay anchored off the moorish strand ,
Our burial ground 's found us .
Her breath long drawn at intervals , looking down
Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came ,
Their trustful hearts shall rest on god ,
Watch every side , and turn to every sound .
The winding paths that lead up to the heights
They make their fortune who are stout and wise ,
The powers of nature in me , lest they run
First follow nature and your judgment frame
And whispers of the lonely weight she bore ,
If no fell sorrow , like the serpent , came
Slowly it spread its wings ,
Crush our lost race -- and brimming fill
The forests hung heap 'd in their shadows profound .
Lest the wind aside should turn it ,
He all the country could outrun ,
In passion tides would ebb and flow .
Light flowing , from whose amber-seeming waves
Whose breathings mingled with the midnight wind .
And the domesticated fowl passed on
Leapt , lighting dark clouds charged with thunder .
The wicket swung and firmly latched ,
The pine boughs they blazed chearfully
From whence to france the warrior 's passage lies .
She felt her drained heart within her cold ;
And their most righteous customs made me scorn
Thought went wanderin ' wide --
Languid and lost in all the pains of love .
Nor by desert to give offence ,
Say who hath touched the secret heart of thee ,
And primal rightness took the tinct of wrong ;
We blend our mingled tears .
Rose from the ashes that her prison made ,
Mark what radiant state she spreads ,
Still many a man stands living here ,
For it has made the earth an endless hell ,
Of yellow moths stirring faintly tickling wings
And his tongue shall be filled with praise .
So loud the cry of weeping rose ,
The weapons which nature to him hath lent ;
The heavens rent from end to end
Moved by vile passions sprung from hell .
Whence a rare glory issued , and a smell
Grim masks of hollowed bark assume , invoke
That seed to rank maturity had grown ;
Your world-wide honor stained with shame , --
Or does it shine in my lady 's tower
To know as i fall asleep --
Flashing and cast around : of all the band ,
Slices his head , to scatter all his brains ,
The groans of dying men fell 'd to the earth
By hapless fate conducted , he arrives
Bring rest , relief from toil and heat ;
The same will come , you 'll find :
A shepherd went astray --
Then the safe gate securely pass 'd ,
't is here our true glory lies ;
Shall hold the past but as a dream .
His voice with a musical melody swelling ,
Thus singing as he went , at last he drew
Your roses red their petals shed
Summer with glad cicala 's song they fill ,
And stained the record of man ,
Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union .
The great kind hands that showed
The road that leads to hell ,
Casts all its clustering foliage to the winds ,
Sank down in darkness where no image comes .
Who puts his trust in thee .
Our hearts that follow as children led .
And then my heart with pleasure fills
One the stern trumpet calls to war :
The open grate makes things look rich and mellow ,
It gives to beauty holiness ;
Toward the truth , drawn gently by his teaching ,
Nowadays he puts his savings ,
Up to his ear the notches drew ;
Tho ' he fell beneath their _ thousands _ ,
Which hurl them flaming to eternal pains ,
Will ever fill our souls with doubt and fear .
That rose while we , who kept thy faith ,
Why he his destiny could not control ?
The pages hang bright scarfs upon the boughs ;
Till even the conquering fleet in silence lay
When our eyes close , we only pass one stage
His lonely song was made
That it shuts by times to gloom ;
The moon , this tranquil evening , sees
With tender tears of rapture sprung ,
To turn to impotence their strength ,
Of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams
Have faded away like the grass that we tread .
Had lately fled with wreathed vapours , showing
And made him see who had been blind ,
Torn my scare-net into tatters ,
To feel the veil of centuries withdrawn ,
His heart grew steady , his breath came back .
On the lips that told no tale ,
I set myself to tempt him from his proud
Unswerved by shattered worlds upbuilt once more .
Hath the lord his guidance given ,
With the hurt of the wounds it bore .
The wee thing 's cradle stood at night
Where tamar was that seemed or feared deceit ,
So it was in the suns that followed .
Come the undying thoughts i bear ?
Than the sand that makes the shore :
Your switch-like music whips the midday heat .
To mark his thanks and honest pride ,
It would come as a _ terrible _ blow .
While thou attun ' st thy morning lay ,
Sickened with grief her lips dare not express .
But something made to suit with time and place ,
A douglas follow 'd to the martial strife ,
In the vessel placed her army ,
One southward bound his way must win .
And a sorrow found us there ;
Though human voice might never touch our ear
So goes the folly on .
For heart of grace that would not suffer wrong ;
It stands and takes the morning light !
I know 't is glad the winter 's gone
Each that we lose takes part of us ;
Fainted his spirit . leeches sought to allay
Now rings the woodland loud and long ,
His consecration will be stayed .
Beating the walls of a mute despair .
Its wrinkled image lies , as then it lay
Now heart is laid so close to heart .
't is deeds that i prefer to see :
A youthful light and blond stirs in our home ;
That drew his weary face did softer grow ,
Their being void , their souls are cast without ;
With the first bay-leaves that flung
And pleasure , leaping in the streets with sin ,
Till came the shadow of a fear ,
The chills which shake , the heats that burn ;
Has laid the treacherous giant low ,
And bloom and strengthen into age .
These are the periods we must pass .
The nightingale that in the branches sang ,
Pressed onward , filled with zeal and pride ,
Of the brave hearts that nevermore shall beat ,
Which , opening inward , in each separate soul
The laughter that dries the weeping ,
Tables of the law was made ;
Love 's light summer-cloud only shall cast .
And sudden and solemn the silence fell ,
A people struggling for their right ;
To see the careless post go by .
The waves lie still and gleaming ,
Old mother cleared away . the clock struck eight .
In friendly words he made reply :
And of the sweet perfume it spilled
Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed
Far off the village clock struck one .
Shun them ; their cities hold a hostile host .
To pay due visits , and address the fair :
Knew that the hour of peace was come ;
I catch a glimpse of your averted face ,
But from that throne as calm the shadow falls ;
Her buried body fed the life she drank .
And to scatter seeds around him ,
When daisies go , shall winter time
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall !
But that week brought a great joy to punch .
Our life were lying till should dawn at last
A coward 's shield have spurned .
Who spreads her charms to every wind that beats ,
To go to bed and take his rest ,
Did i hope to breathe such joy !
This eve intense with yon first trembling star
Like those of old ) to lips that made
Thy hand extend , to heaven thy vengeance sacrifice .
Your last flight went rather low .
For the time runs to waste ,
So fiercely blazed the wildfire of their strife ,
Truth comes , and tears , and glamour goes .
Pale pallas swept with shrill and steely clank ,
If through the haunts of living splendour led --
How summer 's royal progress shall be wrought ,
( to lend the hour 's mean hue
What makes the light in them sparkle and spin ?
May meet with hearts whose bounteousness
Deep in my soul the trust shall lodge secured ;
May turn a flow of joy to grief .
The reason else our swords shall tell . "
The weeks went by as the weeks must go .
" so often going astray
Then let the charge be justly laid ;
Whom death can not sever ?
And sullen clouds bound up his head .
That all my taste has halted .
But there i laid the scene . there early strayed
Or busy housewife ply her evening care ,
Their wands the sacred heralds raise , --
That either has once been stained with sin ;
Thou ' lt see how of necessity must pass
Of justice , that doth macerate them so .
Deep thoughts revolving , in the lofty halls
Hugo replied , " thy happy foot is set
The honeysuckle shows
That kisses everything it meets ;
Brief letters came from helen , now and then :
And finds too late that men betray ,
Why is his clenched hand raised ?
The rivers are swelling ; the thunder is knelling
Take the horse that brought the bridegroom ,
No solid front it reared , for sterile rush
Where all things else bore taint of sin .
Of day is folded , and himself withdraws
Perpetual snows invest the ground ,
Deck the long vista of departed years .
Bot on i take , and that is pride ,
What accidents had touched my brain with doubt ,
And talk about the tidings which he brings .
An ample vase receives the smoking wave ;
Present to grasp , and future still to find ,
Health walk where pain has trod ;
Some going for one , and some for another !
The dry , brown leaves have dropped forlorn ,
And o'er our land a shadow lay
For that it was your stormy coast he spread --
Nor less than when his veins first leapt for joy
Of love i joined myself to her , and plunged
Yet the story has lived with her living ,
Strange thoughts are born , until he doubts the lore
That , more than heaven pursue .
Of him whose destiny has heard its doom :
To draw bee-murmurs from the dreaming lute --
And in a place of peace pursue the quest
The thunder follow 'd . in the troubled air
Where through the opened eaves the moonlight fell ,
That life in folly would vainly fly
At last had grown the crushing weight ,
That both might prosper one must bend ,
But soon they 'll turn to ghosts ;
She gave a rippling laugh , and out
Comes the tyranny of one .
And send it shrieking down to burn in hell
That we should give to each his kindly greeting .
And bitterer northwinds then withheld the spring ,
There , where our hearts would have you go .
And make a vast monopoly of hell ?
Our fleet should give some starry band a name .
Was the uproar that rose when met the fronts
The centre moved , a circle straight succeeds ,
Will see his name and fame increase
Whose arms of love would grasp the human race :
But they to me no joy can give ,
And clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts ,
Whose fountains ever run with joyous speed ,
The heart that sighs for woman-creatures still !
He 'll find chastisement 's sharpen 'd blade ,
Ah me ! how quick the days are flitting !
Beneath the gory waters sunk ,
When dipping in the victim 's blood thy hand ,
The waves run murmuring up the beach .
By the low sun thrown forward broad and dim ,
For the rich help of books he always took ,
About a shining dream come true .
Much bolted thunder there requir 'd to be ;
In wild lament ; all spark of reason fled ,
The hope , the trust , the purpose stayed ,
Though thunders roared and lightnings glared ,
The abbot fills him , too , with fear ;
When fiercely battling with the raging deep ,
The faintly crimsoned cheek that shows
And low in death thy princes lie .
The black veil lifted from the mountain 's crest ,
In sweet disorder lay a throng
Leaves speak everywhere . the willow leaves
There is no wind to stir the leaves ,
The moon had come to mean only betrayal ,
The precepts that we held i kept ;
On which to lay his weary limbs and head .
I have no cash , i lie in pawn ,
The gems lay on the table like shoals
Friends whom his lordship keeps in store ,
And yet i firmly stand my ground ;
The woodland dons its brightest hue ,
Never comes to no good en ' .
The treacheries his seed should undergo ;
The briars turned to roses , roses ;
A bird that bears upon its wing
Shall make them virtuous , and preserve them free .
We see them dropping from your eyes .
The crescent moon hung in the evening air ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
She strove to rise ; but oswald with quick words
How the wave washed in his sailor lads ,
Remembering well how fear in days gone by
Here ráma stands , by virtue known :
The singer 's rhymes refused to meet and kiss :
And made his hands to struggle in the air ,
And long the plant a human heat retained .
Or be counted vulgar and set at naught .
So turns the lion from the nightly fold ,
My childhood passed . i can remember still
Its wonted mirth regain !
To feel the joys of fellowship restored .
Their humble cause did with much warmth embrace .
And shot red fire and shadows through the cave ,
You brighten and warm as he bleeds ,
Over again i feel thy finger and find thee .
With shivering timbers crashed . with hopeless toil
She lays the body under the dancing muses
To these , until another rumour reached me ,
Here lie the chronicles that told
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid roof ,
The biting axe of florence . farther on ,
Every promise gives me joy .
That gave the chance to knave and thief !
To press his gory hands ;
Their answers form what men experience call ;
That beat at the dripping pane
To bounding joy , and make young pulses beat
And with his sugar 'd words to move ,
But , mingling with these sounds of strife ,
To arm my soul with faith and prayer ,
And the swaying flames of the firelight
What terror strode before his track of blood !
By those brief words , accompanied with smiles ,
But bold tydides to the rescue goes ,
That might with heaven itself compare .
High heaven with trembling the dread signal took ,
Each stole a tear for what he left behind .
God help the souls that will meet their doom
Bringing dear visions to weeping eyes ,
Your one possession , grows a perfect thing
To read the starry soul of this blind man ,
What air receives her blessed sigh ,
Chewing with teeth that grind and crush , each part
Where the smart procession goes ,
Thus her discourse directed afterwards :
Ere o'er the east arise the second dawn
And , casting on the moon a mournful look :
And never breathe a word about your loss ;
Gold upon clay , and found her inscrutable ;
The time the 'till ' ry regiment came ,
Such course he held ! bologna 's learned schools
Let thy shafts be sped . "
Which set the horror higher : a maiden swooned ;
Let them beware when they your path would span .
Weak from hardships new and wearing ,
Wide as the sun displays his vital fire .
And breaks the rigid edict of the skies .
Part of such slumber make
Twice forty thousand warriors pressed .
That you serve humanity .
Which dazed the sight of the astonished foe ,
Beauty forever dares to widen and retrace
Upon confusion rose : and now all heaven
I trust what sorrow the fates may send
Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend ;
He , the one that forged the heavens .
But now your pride of beauty is all gone ,
Of the queenly dames that bore us !
To wash away that precious name
Abode his destined hour , and went his way .
By a slight motion followed out the imprint .
Let it go round thy table ;
To tread the lower ways of daily life ,
But that dire scene had most thy pity moved ,
The weird bird muttering by the waves of dread ;
At the woe that weighs it down .
But those which fill 'd his banker 's book .
Still mid the corpses and the blood fought on
Shall strengthen while the years go by :
Or watch the spray as the colors play ,
Moved by vile passions sprung from hell .
The lightning flash of sabers made
Hast found it : for this silence , filling now
Of flickering horror in the sectors where
They baited a trap with a crafty bait ,
Forced from the navy , yet the fight maintains .
She had also snatch 'd a moment since her marriage
Four seasons fill the measure of the year ;
That found him under sea :
And scarce my milk could draw .
For the lost pathway leading to the village .
They see no sorrow in those sacred courts ,
The moon is lighting up the skies
And women -- things that live and move
" what visitation hath there come from god
Take fire from heaven of day
Broader visions coming -- growing --
And gather each sigh that she breathes for me .
While youth my veins yet fills !
With sacred darkness shades the face of all . "
For rude forward persons who give themselves airs ,
That held the lore of ages olden ,
And life 's swift stream goes straighter --
Then rose a cry within me , and my heart
Of incense curled about her , and her face
Dark oaks and fluted chestnuts gathering round ,
The bowl goes trim . the moon doth shine .
New courage and revive , though now they lie
Was wild to back my skill and mettle ;
Influence produced by the action of his age
It reached annette upon the low , white cot ,
For thee alike the circling seasons flow
And fought together ; but their names were lost ;
As the notes triumphant flowed !
E'en malice and spite will yield ,
And the laughter gay that follows when i try
To guide a hand unsure and old
We reached the coast : i crossed the sea
Comfortless jealousy , with whom there came
That comes from dying men
Where the foothills fall , and rise .
Which walking this gold morn i see ,
The still shy turtles range their dark platoons ,
Of princes . their true tears and smiles are seen
The daughter 's sorrows can betray .
A flock that caught at wiles , because
Threading the ominous silence of that fear ,
Space may produce new worlds ; whereof so rife
Should pale with anger or with pain .
Thou swayest as the breezes pass ,
Which wealth confers .
That bears us far from thee !
I can not tread the dark path here .
Degraded , to what wretched state reserved !
She went on .
On what relying , to crush such a foe ?
For tears and sighings made .
And passion has spent its rage ,
And wailing loud , from a long vista stole ,
For they will breed sad strife ;
And thro ' unnumber 'd changes carry 'd ,
And breathe my soul in fragrance there !
Has laid his axe , the reaper of the hill
The clamor had subsided , and tommy had drawn
The late grapes cover all the vine with fruit .
No christmas ghost can make us chill ,
Which i much wonder comes not to your minds .
This can unlock the gates of joy ;
Who , while his quivering lip the summons gave ,
The war paint on their faces filled
Which joyously was mirrored in the sea .
Weak still , my weakness leant on my belief ;
Which once again has come to persecute ,
Out came sundry comic indians
The splendour that orion spills
The death gloom settled on her brow ,
From folio 's of accounts they take their handles ,
His flaring beams , me , goddess , bring
O'er the nations holds its sway ,
Victorious henry pours the rage of war ;
For grief it thawed into a tear ;
Renew , create , sustain ,
And yet at no time could her death have brought
The sun 's bright rays are thrown ;
You almost feel the date ,
And the eyes served not for smiling .
Faith , hope and love are given
That met the grassy level of the vale ; --
Thus wears the month along , in checkered moods ,
There goes the hearse , the mourners cry ,
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
And take delight in what her hands had wrought .
Some sad fate will overtake thee . "
Backward , still backward , bends the bloody chase ;
Heaven keep them happy ! nature they seem near .
Or step ran sadly through that antique house ;
When all the glistening fields lay white with frost ,
When the wide bloom , on earth that lies ,
Satan exalted sat , by merit raised
Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Then rush 'd the steed , to battle driven ;
Have we lost the wreath we braided
To share with him the pang of woe ?
And leafless shake the trembling trees .
To whom the voices of all rest are given ,
However , time i ca n't afford to lose ,
Thy guardian fire , thy guiding cloud ,
That keeps it fragrant with its memory .
To run up debts on every side ,
But who will spend all day chasing a butterfly ?
Perhaps when he wishes to take a snug nap ,
And i have thought it died of grieving :
He brought in fashion roman noses .
And the font of tears unsealing .
Still smarting from those strokes so fell and dread .
Far as the sight can reach , beneath as clear
With that perfection which its being meant :
Be wiser ere the night go by .
And tycho tasted happiness in his hour .
Break into writhing life and bloom
The follies that i shared not , spending all
But , if there should come any rain ,
It was a sacred union formed between kindred spirits --
Love framed with mirth a gay fantastic round :
With streams of blood , but life remained .
Which spurning contempt shall redeem from his ire .
I tap the rich treasures of time --
No art its severed strength could bind ;
I see the yellow flicker of it creep --
Wealth could not save me from the grave .
Of the spring that ran sae clear :
The powers of nature in me , lest they run
Were grief i could compass ;
What of the sight when horrors swirl ,
Take note of thy departure ? all that breathe
Levied a kindly tax upon themselves ,
Her gesture floated toward the iris bed ,
Remotest india hears your deeds of fame ,
From his gray locks the diadem he took
And the duke godfrey , did attract my sight
Did not our holy book most clearly say
Expound the hidden causes , nor find names
This stern remembrance to his troops he gave :
The brothers followed to the maiden 's bower ,
Down which the wind flowed much as water flows ;
His monarch saw him coming from the war ,
This mouth supplied with fearful teeth .
To minos down he bore me , and the judge
The burdens of being on us weighed ;
Nor felt the magnet 's sly seduction .
And from its frame a soul dismiss 'd for spite
It mingled strangely with my fears ,
Until he got possession of his skin .
And all alone went she .
Where truth and goodness dwell , there enter in ,
Enough 's a feast , content is crowned .
Of fancy rise full springing : but not mine
Coarse and hard thy saviour lay ,
Found the winds were not in battle ,
It came with sundown noises from the moors ,
Perpetual sighs which seek a happy place .
And their oaths are kept at leisure .
Last night her royal progress made ,
The light gave colours , which upon them fell ,
A glimpse i caught of that abode , by thee
Shade follows shade , as laughing zephyrs drive ,
But she went on unmoved , and stood the while
And nature says that all must die .
Breathed faintly on the stale , whirled air
By a confused sound that issued from it .
The train might reach a quarter of a mile :
Till beacon hearts make it their own
Will turn to clay . "
Hope , whose whisper would have given
And from mouth to mouth thus trembling it flies :
Dire panic held , companion of chill fear ,
The truth of his goodness forever shall tell .
" the sacred book that may preserve my soul
A heart that stirs , is hard to bind ;
But with it came the glorious hope
Kindled , thy ken a higher flight shall mount ;
And you an equal courtesy should show . '
It made my heart with pleasure beat ;
Found i no kindness in the silent moon ,
Forests shot up shafts of mammoth trees .
For through the night a change had taken place --
It watched the centuries come and go .
Will guard my honour and avenge my cause :
For us who 're snatched as brands from hell .
Seeing how his rival ran
Such dreams should be put to school :
I called on death to terminate my pain ,
Lover of virtue , take the voice divine ;
Sees only such things rise .
Might in a wondering season seen afar ,
Told him quite plainly how the matter stood ,
And grasses cast to dust
The father ’s word must true remain . ”
Spacious swanks lay low .
Against their wils they take a counterview .
Young liberty gave her libations to flow ,
Of old delights and sweeter days to fall :
The swordfish keeps the sea ;
But if indeed there came a sign from heaven ,
Eternal splendour for the soul is set ,
The biting axe of florence . farther on ,
All rights reserved . this book , or parts
As lovers steal to bliss ,
The stubborn pride of roman nobles broke ,
Plundered wealth and glory flown ,
A bitter sigh i drew , then scarce found voice
And bring our journey long to wished end ,
And the firing died away ; and the night fell
But that bright pageant will not stay :
And pleasure claims a share ,
I watched the languid chain of shadows pass ,
That he half dissolved in tears .
And daughters whom life had crushed ,
With me alone the path pursue . ”
When thy wisdom calls for fighting ;
Song , " follow a shadow , it
And through their hollow aisles it plays
And pass the gloomy nights of winter there ?
The spring blew trumpets of color ;
These losses will all be arranged with a whiz .
Turning not otherwhere , with minds set fast ,
And the cold north receives a fainter day ;
Fair living things made to thy will of old ,
Shyly yet , he made essay :
Voices that called with ceaseless crying ,
Which made the arbia to run with red ,
The grandeur of her deeds recall ;
The tuscans raised a joyful cry
Nor knew the rare , sweet note she struck
Knows that to put more faith in lies and hate
To human nature gave , that its creator
The kingly pontiff raised on high
I felt the blackness come and go ,
To make the scene more lovely yet .
His trust to test were bringing .
This file contains translations of the following works :
That brings no fame or glorious meed ,
Will meet the blood-storm 's awful shock ;
And often find an evening gay .
Air wandering amid the eagles ; yet
Across my path the red leaves whirled .
Of all flowers that breathe and shine .
Where the rain may fall upon me ,
For only a sound of lament we discern ,
And health would soon return .
Then he hunts for strongest sinews ,
And straight to bharat ’s presence came
From which foul slanders thickly rise .
The daily round of life went on ;
But here an important distinction presents itself . philosophy is
A spirit from this place went forth to name him
Achilles and the heroes that were gone .
And her too trusting heart was left to break .
When the silvery trumpets of christmas have pealed ,
" i should find such words by hundreds
The wither 'd leaves all skip and hop ,
Down her sad cheeks the torrents rolled ,
Their bravery take , and darkly hide
While love for it more strongly in them burned .
The rejoicing will last for many suns and moons .
Rejects mankind , is by some sylph embraced :
Heaven 's gilded troops shall flutter here and there ,
And each new impulse tends to make outflee
The human visage lost by dian 's hate ,
Perhaps turn out a sermon .
These be delivered and their quittance made .
That has passed over : so this may depart !
And then their anger broke .
Firm rooted in a surge a ship should stand
War shall claim command of all ,
There 's a star to guide the humble --
A slowly pacing asses ears he bears .
As though a song were rising there the while .
The place receives the motley throng ,
With winged and living sound that sprang
Stood mute and weeping , overwhelmed with woe .
Undying hate , which rolls
As the daylight slowly faded ,
That breathed a fragrance through the balmy sky .
Tossed into bright confusion .
On thee my heart is resting :
The sea sucked downward to its depths , laid bare
The bitterness at a glance , and pressed
And sleep stood trembling side by side with death .
A thousand hearts lie fallow in these halls ,
Like an airy bubble rising ,
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast ;
When your exclamation made me think
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee ,
And to his life is knit with hourly bands .
It came ; and francis norton said ,
She turned her from sir leoline ;
When tempest toss 'd on life 's rough sea .
Whose trembling notes steal out between
At night its little cradle stood
To plant upon the rebel towers
To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn .
And lost in pleasure slowly roam ,
There was a rainbow stealing through the rain ,
Juggles more games than my sins 'll count .
And within it came a people
How fast their own brief moments flee .
And his strong heart leaped within him ,
Black clouds hung low and heavy ,
Our spirits follow where they go !
The sprightly morn her course renewed ,
But o ! fell death 's untimely frost ,
The death film hung .
The monk 's eyes stared in nial 's eyes :
" such the refined intelligence that glowed
" onaway ! my heart sings to thee ,
The increate perpetual thirst , that draws
I 've chucked the matrimony plan , "
In sickness spurn 'd , in death forgot .
To read within the heart of time all truth
To give false witness taken pains ?
And venice scarce her freedom can maintain .
And welcome came or went at will .
At thus being held unable to explain
Since earth first saw these wonders -- and i said
The dew lay on the hawthorn ,
" better befits to make the sacrifice
But her ambition never reached to roast .
The heart i sent it seeking .
I gave my order sharp and hard ,
The power , mankind to govern and restrain :
( sublime and great from that which fell , )
In sultry noon when youthful milton lay ,
She met the blow and sunk into his arms ,
Weaving joy in choral measure
Nor left he heirs to share his powers .
The music stopped and i stood still ,
Till the bloom of your cheeks has faded away .
" what , goddess ! this unusual favour draws ?
Free empire got and lordship on the man ,
Another door , whence sound of voices came .
Quiet lay the sturgeon , nahma ,
A speechless wrath , that rises and subsides
The cook came out as the clock struck one
Against the sun they gave to shine
In each new land and harbor a new soul !
Then silence followed ; then began
Remorsefully he died , his bedclothes biting .
His sails were filled with another wind ,
So good men lengthen life ; and to recall
The vision came and went ,
And that made the ill beginning o ' t.
And to the skies its hearers raise ”
Like autumn leaves blown by the dreary winds .
Brook ! whose society the poet seeks ,
Where salt the waters of the tiber grow ,
Shrill , piercing as the seaman 's cry
The thronged arena shakes with shouts for more ;
Where the rainbow spans the flood ,
Creations new in fancy 's field to rise !
For storm on earth above had risen from under ,
Bunched sticks that burst their string and wrapping
Have a worse course to steer .
Before her body knew the flame ,
Their sighs concluded , and their sorrows spent ,
All eyes on her fair visage fixed and bent ,
Be all of such moments made up ;
On the wide sea went he forth ,
When the clock struck the hour for retiring ;
The old piano plays an air ,
To prove that genius lives in humble birth ;
And meekly took what fortune sent :
Bed that has brought me ecstasy and sleep ,
You 'll find it indeed an infallible charm
When to torment him new misfortunes rise :
The maples sang and flung their banners high ,
When clouds in skies do come together
Itself admitted with the bridegroom 's train ,
And every band as by his throne it went ,
Of incantation , demons rule these waves ;
And trails its blossoms in the dust !
Her way may lie thro ' rough distress !
And towers that touch imaginary skies .
When pale disease attends on weary toil ,
To give thee thanks we come .
To make a place for prayer ,
No angry clouds frown , nor sky darkly lower ;
I took that hand which lay so still ,
From the old oak chimney place it came .
I can not feel that i am free .
From great dundee , who smiling victory led ,
That shoots the flare and shuts to dun ,
And full success his toils have won ;
Waters the odorous banks that blow
And two actors more now enliven our play .
And i feel the chill of the depths that lie
The scent that issues from the apple-tree ,
For any pains of death to fall from thee !
I drop my heart , unshriven !
Eye that swims in sunny light ,
Ebbing , the battle left those elder gods
I know , bore witness to the apparition
To place them ministers of the fifth moat ,
And only what would cause him grief revealed .
The tears i shed must ever fall :
And make those flights upon the banks of thames ,
Whence no contending foot could reach the ground .
Cheap doctrines forced , wild uses taken ,
As the sun slips down the day .
The kingdom of heaven he takes by violence ,
Of the quivering lake he spread
Another glorious angel came , who bore
Already would they pass their life , hedged round
The dart by brahmá ’s grace bestowed ,
Lie a ' that would my sorrows share .
To thames 's banks which fragrant breezes fill ,
Upon mine eyes that straightway turned me pale !
Glory and honor will to him be given ,
Blithe concord 's social form to gain ;
That set me studying every time i view them ;
Somewhat mixed with mysticism .
And the little reeds sighed ` abide , abide ,
Resounds the bygone freedom of the sea ,
With all that e'er drew breath ;
Nor took a punch nor given a swing ,
Urge him with truth to frame his wise replies ,
And the twilight hath taken its place .
Is woven first of them ; from dreams are made
Upon the which is founded the high hope ,
Upon her wings presents the god unshorn .
I sought no quarrel . a few hasty words ,
To make its life more sweet .
His health could be too dearly bought ,
Taking the doctor 's word that death was caused
In misery : such joy ambition finds .
The cricket raised its cheering cry ,
In disguise the eternal hunger lay ,
There is waving of grass in the breeze
Oft finds a poison where he sought a cure ;
Of good so counted in the foregone days .
Except by clouds that drift thro ' heaven and catch
A watch will tell the time of day ,
Till god released her of her pain ,
And cast the dark foundations deep ,
The vortex of the world spins raptureless ,
But weighed with suffering and loss .
And all round the candle the crooked shadows come ,
Every sorrow and trial that waits upon man .
When change itself can give no more ,
Adown the mainmast fell the parted string ,
What vessel bore him o'er the watery way ?
Backward i draw your anguished hair
Then , licensed rage her hateful prey devours .
To shape her dreams in marble , and so sweet
Some resting flower of yesterday 's delight .
That swung and swooned and panted in mad sighs ,
The brilliant blooms that lay thereon .
By sweet attraction , no less strongly drawn ;
And there it was i last took leave :
Worked as the blood 's beat worked therein .
If being fails ) , more mournful riddles rise ,
That told their hopeful tale .
Which a long season has in hunger held me ,
The brink of hell , to catch its sound ,
Aroused him ; loud it came , and near !
But what comes sneaking , there , to view ?
The joyful tale shall come to me the last
Was made the one to rhyme with margaret .
“ assistance gave . up to the skies my arms
Hath borrowed radiance of eternal day ;
Ay , faithful to little boy blue they stand ,
But grace can conquer slavish fear , --
That lie behind me , guarded by the cross
Soft borrowed glamour of moonbeams doth woo ;
And gave my love a fall .
The ruler of spirits gave them their reward !
The summertime comes , and the summertime goes --
And their hunger is filled ;
But the wave broke within my breast :
And of that fruit makes timely use
Daphne , for lo ! her hands shot forth upraised
The fairer riddles come from out the night --
But set to vaster harmonies , they run
Canadian provinces they lay
A wild and warlike group they stand ,
Then , fiercely moved by wrath and pride ,
The pious choice had pitched upon the verge
And the salt sea it came in .
And it blew a colour bright as the bloom
His rays draw in the circle of the shade .
Nor yet from life and its sad memories fled .
Where my joy may work unnoticed
True lovers i can get many a ane ,
Which treads o'er the hearts of the free .
Or bring again the pleasure of past years ,
Clean table linen , say your prayers !
Giving promise of peace , or assurance in war ;
It lifts her soaring , near the daylight spring ,
All things in time submit to sad decay ;
But each temptation , if we do not fall ,
To the ripe fruit thy vernal season bears !
And ere the red moon rushes through the clouds
The city which once made the long resistance ,
I 've noted the wedded life of such ,
And were a kingdom 's ransom told ,
The sensuous foe to all happiness lies .
Wine will fill our hearts with cheer !
In such sad vices never was he found .
And to his lord such promise did impart ,
And heaven 's ethereal image melts away ;
Far away the waves would wash it . "
It shows how human hearts are hungry
He sought association , and he found
This year 's blossoms , clinging in its coils ?
Nor far the warrior had pursued his beat ,
My naiads blythe the floating accents caught ,
Of some sweet dream long sought .
Than thy grim lid be closed on me .
And it turned to a sonnet .
Thus , diversly to divers ones is given
Away they went down the swollen tide ,
And drank the morning air .
To make it yield the sense of the lord ,
The straying starrs fresh fields make glad .
Until to-day it lingers .
Then came a silence . suddenly like death
Dealt in the fight doth to us belong :
What gave me strength again to stand ?
And this fair change of seasons passes slow ,
The regiment gallantly bearing
Yet europe rang with it for many a year .
And sorrow and anguish have succeeded to mirth ,
The land was made resplendent with his train ,
And sullen clouds drooped low
Oft gives expression to the secret thought .
Whose song has told their hearts ' sad story ;
An equal craft of hand you show
They stand united , but divided fall --
In this desire alone i hither steer :
And now my soul , exhausted , dying ,
Hearts that with rising morn arise !
And each had shown how light we far 'd along
In losing me , you might yourselves be lost .
Forgive a stranger who would make so free ,
He turn 'd his eyes upon his little charge ,
And the clouds extended widely ,
As much as your apron can hold !
The time now pass 'd in viewing every sight ,
And stars came as he watched
Are twined about all transitory things ,
The injian ocean sets an ' smiles
Each a golden column throws
In the days long since departed ,
Or won to what may work his utter loss ,
Sad love pursued where sorrow led ;
Wife found the time to revel in that book ,
And my heart is turned to stone .
But then some meaning must the words convey .
This scholar found the end of all .
As from the kitchens of olympus drew
Grieve not for him whose heart had gone before
Stir from your roots , walk , poplar !
In dividing the work , we distribute the powers .
To lay it waste , that city they besieged .
Ruler o'er the dead , they made him ,
And one of their bright chorus make thee .
Words of rebuke were directed to me :
In love and light her melodies expire .
It tried to be a rose
Atrides still with deep resentment raged .
The silent -- showing how the sickness ceased
To the ideal my vexed spirit turns ,
And was to full discovery brought .
Although he seek it earnestly , thy life .
Who many a citadel hath laid in dust ,
Then loud and long the war-cry rose
All is made up of harmony and love ;
Nor yet the shocking cold you 'll catch
Of sunny brightness , breaking thro ' .
Saw pass a soul sweet as the sovereign tune
And the shrieks that arose
Illustrious gama , shall thy labours bear !
Feeling pain the flame had given ,
And gave him gold to maintain his degree ;
That lies against the night ;
Though in a manger thou draw breath ,
Lest all my happiness should disappear ,
Hard on the track of passion sorrow sped ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
He pointed out the harmony of heaven ;
And tears of joy thine eyes will shed .
And give her grace and bid her swiftly flee :
Storms may howl , and clouds may gather ,
Which in the final judgment thou shalt see . "
Ah , years are filled with learning ,
In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast .
To veil the crime and sanctify the shame .
And held it so ; while helen made the air
And that thrust up to blossom in the sun
Their glance might cast out pain and sin ,
Take thine own wings , and come away . '
From cowardice , not truth , did that proceed ,
And were i called to prove the assertion true ,
" when the wicked war was raging ,
And give to rapture all thy trembling strings .
For i will bring you comfort ,
When brighter flames shall cut a darker night ;
Life should so long play with that breath
There to explain the past -- his faith defend ,
I keep you awake with caresses
Yet his face never moved
Disciple steps on earth when sole they lead ;
The hopes brought forth in doubt !
To hear and mark the oath i call . ”
What ! grieve that time has brought so soon
Humbly they heard his words that stood him nigh ,
Christian towns leave far behind
With a mind fixed intently on his gods
That through the withered leaves of autumn whistle !
The genie heard . a slow smile came like dawn
That ever time in history gave a place , --
At divorce which it proclaims .
Where dauntless nerve and intellect combined ;
Nymphs sprung from fountains , or from shady woods ,
And midst the flowers did peaches fall ,
Rose whose pure face the dewdrops all caress ,
The vulgarest tool that tyranny could want ,
She watches every dawn for what dawn brings .
Life ran high there ; men nourished their hates
Flowed from the knowledge of my heart :
Laughing water draws around it ,
And greeks acknowledge , from electra sprung :
And new loves take with every wind
To thee their honors bring .
And are they lost , our golden years ?
Such proof of what he holds for law ,
Then bold-eyed autumn went on his way
Till vanisht smiles should come again .
Of order and of rule upheld his throne .
From that great heart of christendom which beats
From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise ,
Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise
This action has released him from those confines . "
And gurgling voices came of earth , and rare ,
The rivers of the day are drawn ,
Ah that he had not laid this load of grief
To make the people free !
Call for a love more pitiful and tender ,
Then from afar there came a sound
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt ,
" we lift the weight of flatling years ;
Our bird makes merry his dull bars with song ,
_ wilt thou weep that sweet days wear ? _
And breaks the spell of dreams .
Who scorned the challenge ere his lips it passed .
That mankind might go free , he suffered pain --
Sickness may depart , and time restore him , —
A miser filling his most hoarded chest ,
Rescued , had in his righteousness been lost ?
As all their souls in blissful rapture took :
The brook still glides before .
To make an end of all his wooing ;
I now was of the arch that passes there ;
Throughout that woven music of the days
A prophet then , inspired by heaven , arose ,
Love 's beacon lights set on the shore .
On the thin brazen notes he threw a prayer :
And silence held the tower .
To ward off these dangers that ever befall ;
Success hath gained it at too sore a cost ,
And feel that life is wisest spent
Still tracking turnus through the ranks in vain ,
It made anacreon 's song divine :
Till we have changed our birthright for a gourd
Lone lay the lifeless wrecks beneath the moon ,
Had fain engulfed the growing work of god .
By reprobate desire thus madly led ,
Over the soil , that everywhere breathed fragrance .
With a portable organ slung before her .
Following the round clear orb of her delight ,
" behold , such mercy atalanta gives
The sappy billets on the waning fire ,
The finger of glory shall point where they lie ;
First , then , ambition summon to the bar .
My beauty , which the loftier it climbs ,
And soon each found relief ;
Free of their lives , to guard my fame .
Never to yield those colours but with life :
An evil greater than i may record :
A compliment paid with judgement and ease ,
Filled the evening star with splendor ,
Of red sea winds , a prodigy was cast .
The joyless blank of life to fill .
Of english shores , bathed in the morning light !
A hoof of strength she lent the steed ,
Content , but how to savour hope deferred .
In the fire laid steel and iron ,
In the pure dew , under the breaking grey ,
By night our fathers ' shades confess their fear ,
Father had died before it saw the light ,
Till he heard the song the soft winds gave ,
Last night , though winds beat loud above ,
Took his soul , his ghost , his shadow ,
Where by the castle-gate it hung forlorn .
Where neptune westward spreads his aged arms ;
To some strange sorrow all his thoughts did tend ,
And life between two troubles toss 'd ,
I is the ice which spent nature demanded :
Darwin charles darwin offers us a key
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies ;
And my wistful heart said faintly ,
And thou shalt gain a present as divine
" but absence would distract my heart . "
Of understanding comes unsought
And power was given to wicked men ,
Legends that ran from mouth to mouth
And the golden woods are bathed in light ,
Erroneous , which in blazing ruin fell
Wide spread the laden branches dropping dew
Like to a falcon issuing from the hood ,
Across the stubble fields the lazy breezes pass ,
A chair extends its welcome seat ,
" some compensation find , that the time pass not
Like to a falcon issuing from the hood ,
Should not these letters reach the coroner ?
Everything to me is fearful which creeps this way .
Of pensive memories lays about the braes :
The minstrels raised their strain ;
So that reverberated war was tossed ;
Left the old year lost to all .
Fatigue has laid its heavy hand upon me ;
Close the red portals whence the hours had run ,
Where destiny with men for pieces plays :
The hemispheres of night and day he spread ,
The spirit is borne to a distant sphere ;
To tell , had given him strength to bear
Of eve , which shot its gleaming pinnacles
The fond proposal first was made ,
And the night as quickly follow ,
Begin again the task which never stays .
When winter 's cold brought frost and snow ,
They bring old friends together ; hands are clasped
O delicate chain over all the ages stretched ,
Held out for her annuity .
Where none but elders laid their head ;
Those deadly fangs had seized and ravined up
And flow ' ry velvet spread the marble floor .
Of crackling laurel , which fore-sounds
Whence flowed that sudden tear :
The thirty to their doom they bear .
That kindly providence its care is showing
And wither on the stalk . time calls and change
As it were night gathered dew upon fresh wings ,
For me , my heart that erst did go
The stage of life was there before me set ;
Must meet my flames with equal fires .
Which makes men mummies , weighs out every grain
The storm had come upon me all unseen :
Wherewith our young life was invested .
As the tide comes tumbling in .
The supplication and the blessing sprang
Is spangle-work of trembling dew ,
That in the sunlight rose and flashed ,
" our bleak hills shall bud and blow ,
But which falls from the spirit in its flight
The glory all had left that frame ;
They spread out their splendour along the rivers .
And why ? because far richer prize invites
Fresh and gay i then float onward ,
With passions into ashes turned
Some change it made in visual organs ;
He gave us life , he it restored lost ;
Of a friendship closely cemented .
Until within me doubled was my fear .
Came the spring , and all the forest
Which loves so well its country and its king ,
And flowers themselves , that sway through sunny hours ,
As the wind bore him , floated far away .
The mind grown sick .
And with old poets pass the peaceful hours .
And he spoke the words which follow :
And the fine twigs beneath them laid
Faithless brooks will wander on .
But first the landlord will i trace ;
But other tasks now wait him -- tasks that need
Our hopes go out in tears ,
The world says this to every man :
To whom his birth a god and goddess give !
For pain is sitting on my lover 's brow ;
The perils they had undergone , amid
May still fare onward calmly , honestly ,
And humble faces hid hearts of pride .
So sad a sigh has brought ? '
But still over his speech a gloom there hung ,
Tell us , as thou canst feel ,
Flesh of his flesh , unsparing , passed
Soon as they reached their calm retreat
And time sinks crumbling into shattered space .
And found with ease he then could float ,
Thus they , laborious , forth from battle bore
Well might the birds leave singing on the trees
Stood ruled , stood vast infinitude confined ;
It takes some time for moss and vines to grow
Turn all thy thoughts to eyes ,
Which keeps the sea from the marble palace ,
She lets her martial weapons go :
Fear argues souls degenerate and base ;
If second qualities for first they take .
And now my soul goes wailing !
Eternal sun ! the warmth which thou hast given ,
To slant the fifth autumnal slope , "
That with provision meet the dead may pass
They fitted foreign ( god keeps the sea ) ,
His glad assent at once expressed :
It may be there 'll come up a storm ;
Their life lies all indoors ; sad thoughts
Or shall his broad imperial wings go lame ,
Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh ,
Their shouts rolled to the rafters ,
The sunbeam strikes along the world :
As his hand shall pass over the magical strings ,
In dreamland then we found our joy ,
His patriotism perished .
Thy greatest glory , when disposed to boast ,
And entrance gained to that strong-hold .
He discommended girlhood . ' what
The bellying clouds swing over the housetops .
Shamed silence grew in the traitor 's camp
This life runs dry
But they took it as sign
Who would to love make no replies ,
Through broken tracks a narrow pathway led .
Seek an admirer , or would fix a friend :
Shame folded up in blind concealing night ,
Could lend them no such wings to hover and swoop
Had led unto her heart ,
And there that childhood oft is seen
That we can take delight in tarrying . "
And rhine 's broad river , wandering at her will
It is that thou hast made my life too sweet
Whose cheek by blanching fear was dried :
Is most relief is got from leeches . " -
Which told , he left him tossing in his thought
Now are our spirits cleans 'd and born anew
That fought beneath that banner 's sacred text
But he 's gone to his rest ,
Let our glad numbers extol then to heaven ,
When our moments so blissfully flew ;
Thick lay the summer flowers upon the ground ,
Till daylight disappeared . "
The chaplet fame has wreathed thee .
And in the knowledge went imparadised .
Very curtly , " leave it standing ! "
That bathed with splendour thy majestic noon : --
Has room , elsewhere , to ply his trade .
Where the tall pines ran up , tier on tier
With sacred tasks undone .
Though death 's loud thunder came upon him ,
And faint and fainter fell those accents weird ,
And h. g. wells has found that children play ,
A canopy of green boughs spread ,
My heart fluttered as tho ' winged from mercury !
A blackness gathered like the shades of night .
No force there is that yearning can impel
The lily whispered to the rose :
Disperse the sad reflections as they rise ;
Nine month 's disease its ravages had made .
Achilles feels no pity of the greeks .
Merry christmas always brings .
The owl that , like an evil conscience , sits
And he spoke the words which follow :
Presses his hand to keep the life within .
He bore the ages in his listening eyes ,
That taketh sins away . their prelude still
Of worldly wealth , nor vision that sees o'er
I 'll strive my gratitude to show .
Your gentle voices will flow on forever ,
And all our hearts go forth into the cry ,
When summer 's close brings chiswick shows --
While they gave the nations light :
Their chariots charged ; their ranks of footmen pressed
Again vibhishaṇ made reply :
Blood calls for red blood still .
Observe his form and note his speech .
With stores of honeyed juice , may meet . ”
Of pleasurable ways , to find
There moves fresh maia like a morning breeze
The dewberry dipped for to work delay ,
O river , while thy waters roll
All who turn to it . had this text divine
The boughs soon tempt the gatherer as before .
't is that near her they fold their wing
Which by jumala was fashioned . ' "
It hung long blossoms , heavy with intent .
Draws nearer every day .
She , when she finds no comfort nigh ,
One proof should serve -- a reference to you .
With trembling senses cling and kiss --
Agonized , dissolved and sank .
And laid the loud uproar .
For that i make my prayer ,
The shadows sit and stand within its door
Quick with this spirit new-born nature moved ,
Joyous they brighten the dreariest days ;
Slowly and lovingly wraps up the day ,
When last the wintry gusts gave over strife
The sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies ,
Where no cheerful cottage smiled ,
No eye to mingle sorrow 's tear ,
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes :
Which here the days and nights so seldom wear .
Which such as me so seldom find :
My tower that climbs to see what can be seen
Still turn for the broken in spirit .
Or give your manager warning ?
It found no more the force it lost :
The flash of youth through rags appears .
I saw the hare that raced about with joy ;
For fashioning of its evil beauty brought
Which , spreading wide its veil of dusky dye ,
An emerald carpet stretches wide .
To make the boys asleep .
Of texts which wait with saddle on and bridle
It smiles upon the dreary brow of night ,
But he has met that doom , which long ago
But the light shall burn the brighter .
Nor stay 'd the tyrian islanders behind ,
To touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood .
To form an ideal of taste ,
But when upon the shore the waves them throw ,
Ahti should not go to battle ,
Her fearless eye , determined though serene ,
To sage philosophy next lend thine ear ,
On the absent face that fixed you ;
( who veiled and screened by womanhood must grope )
And broken hearts that knew no comfort then
Now came the funeral-day ; the simple folk
That thrills the grasses , stirs the trees .
The winds through the chambers at liberty roam ,
That pleading voice rose calm and sweet
The voice of ages whispering from the sod .
The women charming , if one takes them rightly ;
" daffodil has it . there she goes .
His glory placing in his country ’s fate ;
His breath came low at first , then deep ,
Stray backward through paths that are dripping with dew ,
It 's nonsense , trying to set things right ,
And hear your music echoing through the grove :
And darkness took the land his soul desired .
In many yeares what never raised was .
The merry lark , he soars on high ,
Which pass like clouds , leaving no trace behind ;
All her heart melted at its gold heart sweetness ;
So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze ,
To hold the dew for fairies , when they meet
Wherein she suffering , all her spirits languish ,
Through storm and darkness yawns the rending ground --
And where'er my footsteps wander ,
Of basil-tufts in florence ; for it drew
And feeling fresh the vigor thou dost give ,
So flourishes and fades majestic man .
The conqueror of his foes will see . ”
Each falling piece was a word .
The flush of life may well be seen
The sun climbs up , but still the tyrant sleep
The golden city come in view .
Where none but savage eyes might gaze ;
In nature 's love unchanged remain .
Like a ghost , that goes at sunrise ,
That nothing should of ruin 'd troy remain ,
For an answer that might stay my bitterness .
Could stretch to look at me .
Dire flight and terror drove the trojan train .
And hailing voices from high branches came .
There burns a truer light of god in them ,
Which a man who was really a carpenter made .
The vale of nature , where it creeps and winds
While the sail-yards greet their vision ,
It leads to glorious liberty ;
And but from nature 's fountain scorned to draw :
Came anguish . charged these warriors twain to face
For these are of the things that never fade ,
The sigh to rise , the tear to steal .
And , armed with cruel hate ,
He doth give his joy to all :
Could catch the thread of their faint pure light .
Lay the proud usurpers low !
Hued later , these held her enthroned :
" great light shall arise from utter confusion ,
Is what i 've spent my money for .
They should be made to smart .
The years come not back that have circled away
Such savory viands the larders presented ;
The limpid water turbidly ran ,
And week days , following in their train ,
Colder and colder blew the wind ,
Now in mute stillness rested all the air :
While merry laughter rang --
The noble hundred thus addressed :
And the garden furrows to set .
Backward i turned me from those weary souls .
The sorrow that makes the days long ;
Her father took another mate ;
And money gives authority to speech .
As if it call 'd the ship along .
To make the earth a sweeter dwelling place ,
Pity -- mingling with thy joy .
And setting fire to whatever it touches .
And the victim is left to his fate .
A twofold result may follow the blow .
A lamp to guide me through the darkness ; and
For gospel what the church believed -
The thunder-bird 's mysterious mark might trace .
A hush fell over the shore ,
And some doughy damper to make good cheer ,
Has made the blood from his right should flow .
Meteor in my heart shall rest ,
Who lap the blood of sorrow , wait :
Full and triumphant : there doth lie the prize
Its beams the ever-burning taper throws ,
Fringed eyelids leashing
Thou seest all things human as they are --
But when she felt i must perceive
Where the water bounds the elfin land ;
The eye with wonder and amazement fills ;
On the image that stands
She rolls through an ether of sighs --
Last link admits a period , who can tell ?
Young hearts bounded , -- and a gay group
Old camden and young selden worked the trick .
And song and laughter will have gone with sorrow ,
The north and south stood side by side :
But she had cast away the right ,
Let all our strength be hurled ;
Her dream , with feast and rioting to blend ;
From hearts that stay unmended !
For heathen heart that puts her trust
And if he can go on the season through ,
Some god would form the purpose in your hearts
Take by his grace a new and alien charm .
And then came peace , and gentle beauty came ,
Of cherished song i pray for and caress .
" splendour eternal , piercing through these folds ,
The earthly stream we trace and know ,
And the song this shape suggested
That public shame would still the deed attend ,
And his brave steed carried him through the fight ,
Whose perfection of mischief he only could reach ;
Nations have looked and seen the fate of kings ,
What rests , but that the mortal sentence pass
Fisherman 's luck makes most men cross .
Hath made him drag his steps and pause
John now explain 'd how england he did reach ;
The husband 's anger rose ! -- and red
But when hate shall have made its circuit ,
By his strong love of her impelled ,
' neath oaks that mused and pines that dreamed ,
And silence grew about her , as though grief
Heaven that feels thy dew !
His huge folds lay like rainbows on the sea ,
In comes the playmate that never was seen .
I a poor comet on high , you see ,
A stem that a tower might rest upon ,
Where the buds at first obtain ;
On gilead road the shadows creep ;
Sweep thy rooms and make them cheery ,
Love gives it energy , love gave it birth .
But lips where smiles went out and in ;
And take the path thy destinies allow .
And time stood still .
And bring the vision home ,
This foolish book of verses meet ,
And his own lofty nature gave him virtues rare ,
With the gentle voices guiding us into peace .
The busy tongue of scandal dared to tell
And find some fun in glory , as a child
Let us pass the night together ,
Then hecuba took up the loud lament :
There in the sweet soft shifting light
Like gathered clouds that seemed to thicken there for
And infamy stands candidate for praise .
Anguish and death attend , and pain severe ,
Like tapers on the altar shine her eyes ;
Death from the looks that wandered with the dead
Intends to pass triumphant , and give laws .
What makes a law where laws were not ?
A mildewing mist it spread
Might banish from thy mind an absent wife .
There flashed the proud swan ’s silver wing ,
And the hills gave back in echoes
And such a one would take command
To guide the feet of peasants and of kings !
And rained on her kindness of tears ,
A lovely dream once came to me ;
They from dispute proceed to ribaldry ,
Earth gets its price for what earth gives us ;
Nor feel the breezes in their lifted hair .
Were not the nations given as thy prey !
And i went courting ,
To take some trouble with his toilet , but
And mourneth as it wears .
They sing a service which they feel :
Which puts us to the proof .
Taking up with her contempt ,
Rather to name our high successes so .
( red rose leaves will never make wine . )
Ervation was lost in a tempest of sobs .
Or ere these lines of battle broke .
Worth being poor to hold in fee .
" if aught could make this soul forget
Thus on each part the sinners stood , but soon
Old peleus charged achilles to aspire
Night brought relief to my sad , aching brain .
Give black and white an equal vote .
My prompt obedience bows . but deign to say
Lords of the only realm which suits the free ,
Did shivering through them run ;
From her sweet neck fair flowers were shed ,
That any life a man can find
Marriage to either binds us thrall ;
You 'll find a story about sir cat
And make thy influence good or ill :
The color of the rose remained .
But briefly on his virtues dwell ;
The point of life where earth and heaven meet .
The heart asks more than life can give ,
Was going to his doom .
And aye the can ' les flickered pale
Her twisting volumes and her rolling eyes ,
Than when sleep breathed his drowsy gale .
It shut behind her , leaving the street aghast .
What sport shall we pursue ?
Before the ice would bear ;
Which in payment they would take .
Those days whose chiefest lore lies chill
Her thankful heart runs o'er .
Sometimes , when everything goes wrong !
And make himself a freeman of this spot
Reeks freshly with the frothing blood , they pour .
Shall leave all grief and unlearn all things sad
And one through fear to reverence grown .
I doubt the friends that fortune gave me ;
Doth always of one kind and force remain .
And cloths and couches live with flame
The sun has set an hour sin ' ,
" because he felt so fixed in truth . "
In you a kindling of the flame that saves --
Hard pressed for money , has gone up and down
And angels lean from heaven to hear .
The fate which sternly threatens there
Beauties that the earth hath lost ;
So ran the far-famed roman way ,
Ice makes no conflagration . state the facts ,
Him comfort in and strength to bear the grief ,
Snow has filled the drifted forest ;
Will make a glorious demonstration .
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites ,
The convent lay , one who had dwelt for long
Has his throne been set around them ,
Nor kindle fumes of wrath his peace to smother ;
Through stress of grief should give resentment scope ,
Cast his strong arms about his drooping wife ,
A bullet sped , and lincoln dying lay .
Time showed my words were true ones ,
And all the gods in shining synod round .
I see far hilltops pushing up blue roofs .
It never shall be lifted . there , whilst thou
Upon a cliff , that at gray morning throws
Take care the fern-seed that the fairies use
Here machiavelli 's earth returned to whence it rose .
With the knocks hard fortune may give )
Until his very steps have left a trace
No rightful plea might plead for justice there :
Still guided by the dreamy song ,
We made use of what we had ,
By winds that coldly blow
White rain where the moorland lies ,
Before him whirled in rattling fear
And bunches of the branches stood :
The painters have fashioned their tales of delight ;
Nor hath she ever chanced to know
Mine own death comes , with anguish sore
The seasons range the country roads ,
’ twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved ;
My father 's death brought mony waes --
Yet he , through merry feasting which he made ,
And the snows that seventy winters bring
And past the trap made for the mill
" and we must perry 's squadron take ,
Whose links about myself my deeds have cast .
Upon his ears that heavenly music broke ,
Strike sail to fear and the bark is lost .
By vengeful furies for the deed pursued .
That every hyacinth the garden wears
Dark lay the waves beneath . hither the tide
From all world feelings that must die with time ,
And i am left alone with night .
What a change has come o'er dian
Prize after prize by nestor borne away ,
Composed a melody that filled my heart
He stayed them from all thrusting eagerly forth .
But that which made thee wiser than the schools
Wisdom sought madness , in her favouring smiles ;
Till blood and wine shall mix and run along
And found love sleeping there ;
Outshone the sun that dazzling light it threw ,
But faithful the angels their vigils were keeping ,
Is richly given ,
That he now may plow the ocean ,
Then the sun , with a hotter light blazing ,
" ere dawn broke , the smoke ascended ,
Now brings a smile , now brings a tear ;
Will flicker in the newly opened leaves ,
Thus smooth his toil awhile went on ,
And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought .
But , mightier still , the arms employed
But soft low notes , borne on the gale ,
The sacred act of friendship shall record . "
The day is spent , the lily folds
As in the dust the prostrate courser lay .
The growing waters ; it unmans one quite ,
Beside the drowsy streams that creep
In talk and sport they whiled away
Drawing unto himself his tail malign ,
The blue birds hung over in ecstasy tender ,
But no sweet bird did follow ,
But lay the maiden lilies
When the trout leaps quickest to snap the fly ,
Tho ' heaving wild it leapt .
And spread the truth from pole to pole .
That a sage feels too small for life ,
As spring approached , were spread through each command .
And every want to opulence allied ,
His courage rose , his voice grew bold ,
Of what fate 's knocking made so manifest
Sends a thrilling pulse through me .
Life enough to stock the sea , --
Where the old flotilla lay ,
The liquid pearl , or twined the nodding crown ,
On my rash courage charge the chance of war ,
And to the holy spirit , " rang aloud
Of the gold trees the heavenly gardens hold .
And though upon him now there fell a sense
Another 's heartbreak serve for two ,
Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring ?
Fearing lest his strength should fail him ,
Old creeping time , that brings decay ,
But autumn 's wind uncloses
High hopes that burned like stars sublime
The gaze lingered on it , for eros had set
Down to the bone the talons went ;
The flaming flowers of heaven , making may-dance
Of the quivering lake he spread
Come on , attack me with that whining prose ,
These leave the sense their learning to display ,
It seem 'd to my young thought the sabbath smiled
And you shall mend your fortunes , mending hers .
She broke into a little scornful laugh :
They feel beneath their shabby coats
And the night shall be filled with comfort ,
Therefore is given us , because our vows
Or i the giants ’ fate had shared .
Apart from these , the happy souls he draws ,
It keeps me with my friends in touch ;
And the pressed watch returned a silver sound .
Make for thy peace , and pace to heaven .
Wake , for your hope draws near !
Trample ! trample ! went the roan ,
But seem to them to close in kindness ;
How grateful , to behold the harvests rise ,
All roads may meet at the world 's end ,
Careens as stars shed tears of woe .
Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed ,
May in peace be ushered in . "
To make thee doubt his faith and lay
Chorus their chant absorbed :
That may set the wood on fire .
Then sadly say , with mutual pity moved ,
Then certain other glorious names we find ,
And tall memorials catch the dying sun ,
So the coming year 'll be spent ;
All the charm that life can give ;
What makes me so unhappy , full of care ;
And tears came to her eye .
Forbids the stars to pass their stated course .
For passion , which will act its part
For they reflect the joy inviolate ,
So many theories come to me . but again ,
I did but touch the honey of romance -
Say , what does all this folly mean ?
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell .
The men folk wear a prosperous air ,
Thy great design shall stand , and day
Ere they sought the battle 's fray ,
The soup , which they at noon should take .
The answer made he could not but admire :
The quickening east climbs to yon star ,
That every hyacinth the garden wears
His heart ; far more illustrious glory calls :
Or who fair memories had left though kindly deserving .
But never a fear my craft will feel .
In tagus ' breast a gallant navy sought
Ere we reach the glorious summit ,
Had , sinking , left me overwhelmed with night .
And on our sofas makes us lie dejected ,
May still the doubts that fill thy breast ? ”
Hell heard her curses from the realms profound ,
Hath left thee blooming still ,
Answered in the words that follow :
True life alone is that which soars
Dust may back to native dust be ground ,
Only through you the tree of life doth flourish .
That brings the noblest plans to naught ,
But that which more completely faith exacts
Life treads down love in flying ,
He wrapt him in religion .
Which rises from a heart that lives in grace ;
She feels the awful pangs inside her ,
Forms of evil against which his teaching was directed
My fiery heart sinks aching . it is death .
Had drawn me wholly , to its burning top .
“ of troy already tottering ; by the gods
Love 's torments sought a place of rest ,
Into the midst of slaughter has dragged back .
Or bearing havoc 's brand
From which there burnt a fiery-flaming light .
Thy pleasing accents shall invade .
In his noon of calmness lies .
Give rest to weary feet ;
The thickening clouds move slowly on
And take the harmless folly of the time !
So when the king had set his banner broad ,
Where remorse no more shall rive him ,
Then on ! then on ! where duty leads ,
How the boat drew homeward filled with flowers .
Where men like insects clung . he saw the waves
Had got a shape like to its earthy mould .
" spite of waywardness thou ' lt find
Bade freedom flourish in this foreign land .
His providence extending everywhere ,
That ancient city sits !
Where quiet sits and dreams .
In every hour that passes , o !
Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound ?
When as my dear this way her pleasure takes ,
Then comes day 's dawning ! my soul bounds upward
And hopes to find some comfort here ;
That the sun with joy your labours see ;
Love will turn to agony ,
Sweet sang the stream as on it pressed ,
Fit incense shall arise .
The first good steed his knees bestrode ,
Lord , give us eyes to bear the light .
And bring them haply to a worse disgrace :
And to repentance and confession turn 'd ;
So when the storm drove in that day ,
My youthful limbs i wont to lave ;
My cheek , where the blushes came and went ;
As leisure offered , close to mr. spring 's
The increate perpetual thirst , that draws
And all the years had vanished ,
And snakes coiled up that look like wedding rings ,
One symphony appear :
I had the loneliness that sings .
Taking delight that he could spring ;
Soul may divide from body , but not we
Or bring my hairs with sorrow to the dust .
On their enemies of old took awful revenge ,
Give me a reason why men call
Down in the thorns rabbits have made their burrows :
Most urgent matters , time could ill be spared .
Before him soon more charming views arise ,
Many a black remembrance bared .
The bravest feels his courage fail .
Fate 's kiss lies dreaming in each stray perfume !
Round about him spun the landscape ,
And leave the track of devils where men built .
But suited to the memories breathing there --
And when thanksgiving came ,
Have power to shake me as they pass :
It was almost dark , and the moments sped ,
Fearless of fortune , and resign 'd to fate !
But , to return to what i lately said ,
In color when a wind awoke .
How to the singer comes his song ?
Of a laidly dragon he took the form .
If he lost his gaelic ?
The hills untied their bonnets ,
For still there comes a fear ,
A man 's voice rises to a scream :
The thunder was not spent
What makes thy melancholy float ?
Each heart recalled a different name ,
First met the morning light . the parish church ,
Frail maudie , whom love led astray .
Give us that peace , oh lord ,
Sorrow revives , her wail of anguish sending
Might spend their earnings then ,
Tennis and toil bring an equal sweat ;
He set himself beside her , saying to her :
And woods and wilds the wailing strains return 'd .
Would show mankind their souls ' antipodes .
And here my song would leave them both ,
Fling wide the grain ; we give the fields
Until they got a view ' ullo
The pang with which my heart-strings tighten
Of splendor and riches which he can display !
Designed to rise in humble privacy .
And snowdrops pushing from the withered grass ,
Watching the long warm silent hours take flight ,
All smooth and level lay the ground ,
To head against the ultimate foreseen rout ,
And objects shorten 'd shadows gave : the sun
The monuments of trojan woes appear !
And mickle haste , the happy tidings went .
Wait till the rolling year goes round ,
The evening wind passed by ,
Peace means liberty and life ,
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
And on his heart a rapture passed
And rapture felt that thrilled me through
All less was lost in that excess of joy ,
And makes what happiness we justly call ,
That solemn structure touched with light from heaven ,
Such slender dimensions go somewhat to show
But ah , review the sorrows interwove ,
Ghost of the glory i see ?
The shadows creep , the sun goes
And lighten 'd up , and trembled into love ;
And alps on alps in clusters swelling ,
Not without reason here i raise this cry :
Thus the magic bird made answer :
Green paths led lightly to its door ,
Should thy hunger still impel thee ,
Tears but indulge the sorrow , not repress .
With soft sorcery to follow ;
-- has the universal language come into use ?
That give the highland breezes ,
Though the wind hath fallen , they drift along ,
Their splendor gone , the wind begins to blow ,
I 'd rock in it nicely , you see ;
Let praise be given to all eternity ;
Through clouds fast gathering , shines a single star ;
The immortal mind craves objects that endure :
A tale that gave such joy as this .
Nor blush , these studies thy regard engage ;
Her moaning soul hath crossed the stygian river .
Another fragrant race will rise to life .
My time has ended , my term has come .
The fortunes of france had undone !
A fount of music , running o'er
Or make their troubles less .
All the old dreams linked with the newer faith ,
The visions departed , and shame followed passion : --
My soul ! it reach 'd not here :
Who builds a bridge that never drove a pile ?
Music has put her triple finger-print ,
His fine hands were not made ;
" is this the fortune i must meet ? }
But though she counts for years and years ,
That lingers in the garden there .
From burning suns when livid deaths descend ,
So , at the last shall come old age ,
Our feet are seamed with crimson scars ,
-- then steal away , give little warning ,
And only war could make us meet
And listening to the sound the water made ,
And blew to flame the brand that held the life
And dishes bear him ; and the doomed goat
To doubt the godhead reigns within !
Beauty through my senses stole :
To trace the change from foul to fair .
Which once my love sat knotting in ! --
The ravening flame , consumed her . all around
When o'er the hill beat surly storms ,
My harry ! that flows not from guilt ;
And memory gild the past .
That 's steeped in any hue should take its dye
And deadly were the strokes they gave .
Too well awake , he feels the panting side
You ran the race , you fought the fight ,
Will brook no opposition to his will .
To bring the light of heaven below ;
Crackle and flare as they burn up hate ,
Its glory , through all ages shining sunny ,
I ' charity her hands find wark ,
Who giveth his beloved , sleep .
Where men go gathering grief .
Both were mine ! life went a-maying
That merriment soon sinks in sorrow ,
Where manhood plays ;
Boy prodigals are lost in wine ,
Which sends celestial souls on errands vile ,
Blossoms that died while dawn itself was gleaming ,
The inlaid porches and casements shone
Such beauty ne’er is found in death ,
Sound sleeper that she is , i take
Cuffs of the fist each dealt him four ,
And leads , meandering as it rolls along
The yellow fog came creeping down
The sun in turn had lit the eastern sky ,
And where wild waters rushed , --
Shall quell the cruelty that keeps me banned
To shun the least temptation to a sin ;
And on his foe with double fury flew .
The crafty wolf the bobbin drew ,
How i shrink from all its glare !
And honour to his mother paid .
At last came forest shadows , and the road
And here shall rise unto the regnant place ,
Apollo 's wrath to man the dreadful spring
With great applause thy learned works shall reed .
His lips and fangs ran blood !
Shut to the door before the night has fallen ,
Were laid by the hand of god .
But only he that feels the smart . "
Or hostile god , is left unknown by fame :
With thy sweet virtues expiate ,
Nothing can spring upon the shores of light ,
Can shake recurrent hunger from her seat .
A cue which you graciously took ;
The regiment gallantly bearing
What ! and the lofty birthright nature gave ,
Her heart was with that band that came
Like wealthy men who care not how they give .
And , while his tears increasing ran ,
A gracious pardon ere we meet the grave ;
My secret woof might gleam so fair as this .
When ogier fell at last upon the foe ,
She finds again the root of ancient will ,
Thine art with all our praises meet ;
Your injur 'd form is seen to bear ;
The battalions in the field go forth ;
The jaggled clouds that fly ,
Hereafter greece some nobler work may raise ,
Is built ; and therefore substance it intends .
And i catch one glimpse as the ship swings past
Going unto every limit
The air of the downs went purely past ,
A sailor as his voice betrayed .
Speechlessly my wings i beat ,
Our brother of the north has seized his chance ,
The goods committed into fortune 's hands ,
The night comes down on a restless deck , --
His lance bold meges at the victor threw ;
The crooning breeze will sway the golden grass ,
Dissenting clamors in the town arise ;
To setten him fro loves grace
Twizzle declares his house sustain 'd a shock ,
Could engage us to drink their health ,
" it puts a crown of lead upon my brain
The winds of heaven gathered there as pure and cold
Unseen by these , the king his entry made :
Changed not his purpose firmly set .
Until there shone a fabric crystalline ,
To open and let out the resurrection .
No purple cloak to shield thee from the cold ,
Wouldst give no credence to my word ,
( you see the selfishness begins to show . )
The air serene born of thy innocence .
On him he heaped blows , with thrusts confused ,
And spend their lives in posting here and there
The vow should bind , with maiden sighs
With sweet content may move her :
And joy so duly meet ,
They look to more than truth , and so confirm
Answered in the words which follow :
Where the salt weed sways in the stream ;
Wherein throughout her frame she felt
And nature speaks at every pause of art .
The skies ca n't keep their secret !
There comes a welcome summons -- hope revives ,
In what unfriendly manner / thou makest to appear
" you find it a tiresome subject ? "
" go , search the world , wherever woe
Whence i to visit them the custom took .
Finding excuse of no avail ,
Then grief and care shall leave no trace ,
And the sad wind comes and sighs and goes ,
A fragrance from the cedars , thickly set
And priam , spreading helpless hands in vain .
Is yet unborn , who duly weighs an hour .
As if the world held none but them .
A wind blew out of a cloud , chilling
To her is yielded by a world reclaimed .
And loaded with the people ’s hate
Another 's heartbreak serve for two ,
It reaches to the fence ,
Though from old dymas ' daughter hector sprung .
That hangs within the dark abyss .
Where colors come to be ;
There 's mony a lass has broke my rest ,
Defy orlando , backed by champions twain ;
See how a circle tends ,
" golden wine will make you whole ! "
Which israel 's vision scaled in sleep .
From these rude shores our fearless course we held :
The people as in life it led .
Flowers and leaves gently nod and sway .
And find new life and deeper wonder there .
Without thy person greece shall win the day ,
Yielded to the kiss i gave her ;
That went before , or was postponed ;
A king might wish to hold in fee .
What rushing stream can keep us long alone ?
And to the ships pursued his hurried way .
Yet ere that day was spent i knew
Where doom sits poised as satan yawns , --
Which made all music the hellenic days --
Then with a slow smile turned the lady round
Agaynst the same no man can make defence
Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh ,
As i lose myself in the infinite main ,
Peace and joy our hours shall measure ;
Sweet sleep has come to thee ;
The door nearly leapt from its hinges , pushed
My flowers all withered , and my blood ran slow
That veils some fearful cataract tumbling loud ,
To shake the centres of domestic peace ; )
She found me roots of relish sweet ,
Their classic wealth the elzevirs display .
And not that other self which nods and smiles
“ bud aw feel rather hurt ;
And wafts its fragrance thro ' the vale ,
White flesh and fair it hid our stains
By touching it , could rouse the melody , --
Than taste their blood in rich feasts spread ,
Fragrant as breath of musk , its odors spread .
And even the river murmured rest
Flames hissed aloft like fiery whips of snakes
And thus went on , with feelings sore :
Or wavered , where reluctant doubts confuse ,
Sweet and solemn that it brings --
Bridal feast held at pimentola ,
Which ranks the yearly pageant , and decides
And all my heart with hope is filled .
She bore the virtue of the magic wand .
Their friendship would have snapped . she treated him
Not anything to me comes strange ,
It fell that in the seventh year , in may
His heart leapt , as leaps the child
So began contention to give delight and be
By stony brook that ran so red of old ,
Their oars of glittering diamond broke the sea
And every sparkle shivering to new blaze ,
Were laid in blessing on my head .
And his maladies hatched in gloom ;
Quick went my breath and quick my heart ,
How it came to an end !
Sagacious all , to trace the smallest game ,
Of clouds that berged the tender east !
My own forebodings tell me more --
How the world woke anew !
Still seek the gleaming walls of paradise .
And maia 's son swift at his mandate flies :
The heart whose sunshine lives in thee
With such the spirit sings ,
To find a friend who has these qualities ,
My heart ever granted a wish or a sigh ;
May share the same , or a worse fate .
And all the coast that runs along the main .
When dreams , relaxing , scarce their captive keep ;
My best ideas here are sown ,
Are wrapped in gloom ,
There might he raise munition , arms and treasure
And then leaves room for repentance .
The train prepare a cruse of curious mould ,
And a gold key took from her bosom sweet ,
That spends its life in beauty and in bliss !
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
A crystal brook ran murm ' ring by ,
Abides content with what it brings .
Must we in future for true heroes look .
We trust they find a happier land ,
The sequel that the future shall unfold , --
Hopes that went forth to conquer worlds should hold ,
Watched his golden wings expand !
And enter our dreams again .
Who lap the blood of sorrow , wait . "
It would have moved a heart of stone
To the sun her prayer addressing :
Lest an things utterly return to naught .
By ease of entering be not led astray . '
As sunny hours go flying ;
Than harried earth . it takes with unconcern
Fills this sad heart and tearful eye ,
Which over our ruined altars yet shall break
Hiding the scars which convulsions have made ;
And laughter arose , and near and far
Its height ascended , where two cressets hung
Oh , scenes delighting , smiles inviting ,
Yet virtue owns the tragic muse a friend ,
I feel it now ! attendant on this bliss ,
In your young men and in generations to come ,
Once , where the windy wine of spring makes mad
Soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide ,
Yet love makes death a dreadful thought !
One soft iris as it passed
Should leave the place too earthy ,
For liberty shall reign supreme
The bond of love which out of nature grew ;
Where destiny with men for pieces plays :
Open now thy store of wisdom . "
Which in a moment fill the world with dread ;
Where the cleft shore sea in his bosom takes ,
Her lips took a scornful curl --
Who filled thy countenance with rosy light ?
Of modes another pleasing style can find ,
The owlet makes us melody --
In peaceful dreams , and fill his cheerful soul ;
In came he , the little foot page ,
Spices mix 'd with flickering fire --
I saw where temples vowed to serapis
He raised in armorica banner and sign ,
The points run in , and the houses veer ,
Strung from the heart of poets ;
The cruel altar brought ; when all prepar 'd
I tried to dodge it as it came ,
From which the weirdest myths are distilled ;
That song was held by holy men :
And the travail of her that bore ,
High will it hold its forehead a long while ,
Listening the lordly music flowing from
Slowly twilight shadows gathered
Still fixed towards the waning light
For it knows nothing of great pageantry ,
Be thou gracious , show me favor ,
For it lives to comfort sorrows ,
This too thereafter brought him most miserably to die .
Which he can pick up at my college . "
Again his battle spat the flame !
Th ' inexplicable sentence held to view ,
And join with thee calm peace and quiet ,
And show the passport she decreed to bear .
Of a kingdom christ will hold .
It will find a surer rest .
Within sent out its yellow rays athwart
The rankest poisons often yield ,
Around , and gives my throbbing pulse its start .
Each ghostly grief sinks down the vast ,
Hid and revealed by its own proper smile :
Wisdom is higher than a fool can reach .
And could th ' impatience set to rest
Searched the hard face for sign of hopeful grace .
Whilst i , their holder , silence keep .
When scarce a year had gone he sped
That seeks the nation-festival to gain .
And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides ;
With sorrow seized , in consternation lost ,
Under what colour he commits this ill .
Is here approved on principle , i find .
The embattled host to closer conflict moved ,
Call 'd forth my amorous desire ,
Who bears the virtue of the sleepy rod ,
There sat one day in a tavern ,
The funeral march to which our pulses beat ;
A mock defence his coward heart believes ,
Makes me powerful over others . "
The yellow lily lies ,
God first made man , then found a better way
Where fate has destined he shall toil no more .
At the plaintive note that came !
( i would make a fuss ) ,
And both will mix sensations deep .
Afar , in rest the cattle lay ;
Where one poor book could unlock paradise ...
Such amazing beauty makes one feel frisky ,
Tyrants fall in every foe !
Even in her the eager fires burn .
So when to you i my devotions raise ,
The beauteous dream its fragrance throws ,
Each in its cauld hand held a light --
Mixed with my loving trusting ones , there trooped
Zohair the poet sang of loveliness
The tongue seek comfort to impart .
Was to relieve distress ;
To what vast heights his mind aspired ,
Finds that his breath comes thicker than before ;
About the roots the cruel ax resounds ;
Of sorrow of heart . the parting hour came ;
I seemed to move among a world of ghosts ,
Here the sign of the cross made
Only because they steeled our hearts to pain ,
Raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes :
The frightened pony plunged a lot ,
And ever with him went ,
Our loving song shall hold it fast .
And night with its starry millions came ,
To find a stronger faith his own ,
Cast its shadow as the day
The heap a moment more had made her tomb .
Such became phlegyas , in his gathered wrath .
" without one virtue left to shield the blow ;
Who word and letter to mount alban bore .
All times delay since that must turn to blame ,
So as it sit thee wel to knowe ,
Love like a gipsy lately came ,
And casting off the veil in falling shows --
And visions of happiness danced o'er his mind .
Thence the relentless heart forgets to feel ,
The morning came , the chaise was brought ,
Thus mostly passed their time for months and years
His sisters follow ’d ; even the vengeful dame ,
But boreas rising fresh , with gentle breath ,
His course intended ; else , how had the world
Carnage around victorious , till they reach
Some god , or spirit he has lately found :
Take my intellect , and use
Advance and conquer ! go where glory calls !
That round and round the linden blossoms play ;
And from them issued forth such dire laments ,
Our heads went crosswise in the country dance ;
To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow :
For these deserts , and this high virtue shown ,
When he drew her direct to the dancers ,
Their minds as rubic censers fume ,
Like a level field they made it .
In pay ? what even childhood gave !
At last , he broke in melancholy strain ,
The songs that make her grieve .
Discovered in his fraud , thrown from his hope
And grief upon his spirit weighed .
Making no summer of another 's green ,
And seek the sunlight in thy golden hair ,
Which gives him such a subject for his verses ,
Care little , take mysterious comfort still ,
The blazing torch applied ; high rose the flame
The first is making suppliants despair ,
They , ere the world had held me long ,
Through which no art could find a clue ,
As it roared along the forest ,
Hastened to fling wide the door .
To keep a lowly , steadfast heart ;
The cold wind of the stranger blew
Men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire .
As wind and fortune ordered it , was bound :
The whole orchard fills , whilst the leaves
And slaughter heaped on high his weltering ranks :
The mountain mist hath caught a beam
Of the big surf that breaks all day .
They rush out fighting . two scholars come in .
Their clamours sank to silence ; then uprose
To my dim eye there rises clear
A coloured chronicle of things that pass ,
Thus quietly thy summer goes ,
The spirits of the foam came whispering ;
Because of the tears that kept coming of themselves .
He ’s put off the red scarlet ,
Euboean lays to my sicilian flute .
As bubbles that swim on the beaker 's brim ,
Thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie
Amiddes of the temple sat mischance ,
From the corrupting earth , that sought to hold
Fled , crowned with fires of tribulations ,
To court the golden splendor of the skies , --
And a ' ter twelve o'clock had come
Thither came three sportsmen ,
The near warm sky bends from on high
In her soft hand a bleeding heart she bore ,
Weighing and noting the long hours through .
And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess ,
Among the woods that lose their leaves ,
That drank its age 's fuel in an hour :
I only know so runs the gossip 's tale .
Where the shells fly night and noontide
Their common shout in chorus , mounting , made
When they know november 's come .
To their music as they fare .
For treacherous peace , the freedom nature gave us ,
Of doom should shake the ground ,
Sure i can take my bible oath
On the faint wind floated the silky seeds
Answered in the words which follow :
My soul intent allows no other thought
He never should bow down to a domineering frown ,
Like us , whose lineaments remain ,
' life is good , and joy runs high
And that , whatever homeward winds there blew ,
Fanning the chill air duskily ,
Their hearts lay bleeding far below ;
Where lost things go ; and he was grown
Sweetness brought on fancy 's wing
Against the worst his saddle could maintain .
A fighting man lay down for ease
Is freedom 's altar fashioned so ?
He came by sure transition to his own :
Winter would follow ?
Unto my heart has come this season ,
Why fly thy shafts in lawless error driven ?
Mandar ’s white summit cleaves the air :
Her rustling score of mozart 's sanctus shook ;
And yet great heroes have been bred by both .
With a wink that was catching .
These best of all verses belong ,
That goes to the heart of a man !
But confess i was frightened when suddenly caught
That gives us back the image of our mind .
And executing judgment it executes with ruth .
And firm the gracious promise thou hast made . ]
That sensibility within him dwelt .
That touches me like poetry . they blow
Can alien pharisees thy kindness tell ,
Though round that grave the trodden grass still lies
The gardens that held plenty in their wombs
And guarded helpless sleep with potent prayer .
Prolonged by the breath she will borrow from thee ;
And brightened into death and died
Give warning to the world that i am fled
A pall of shadow weaves ;
So all men follow love when love is dead .
So kindly hath she grown to her new use .
You point with pride to ancient names ,
A cherub bringing up a soul from hell .
And fall to weary days and locks of snow .
Is lifted to rapture or sunk in despair . "
Without my nino life indeed were sped ;
That many times i to return had turned .
Whirls his black arm , the forked lightning flings ,
Have solace brought and wisdom taught
They marked each burning breath he drew ,
That the long stain of time might fade and merge
What poetry within them lay --
Fast fell the tears , and sighs succeeded sighs :
By this he showed regard for brotherhood ,
And sprays of jasmine gathered for their brows ,
Is it despair i am wading through ?
Thus god and nature linked the general frame ,
His pasture o'er the shaggy cliffs is spread .
Silence o'er peace has spread her pearly wings :
There i made trial , torn from my people ;
God holds the key of all unknown ,
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
And makes the heavens shine with light .
So flashes and so fades my thought , at strife
Nature decreed no mingling gold to shine ,
The bare apprehension would keep one from dying .
And to drive terror from my mind ,
The showers beat
And yet we feel that something savours well ;
Where i found a heart in pain ,
Was followed within my breast
To fix his rate of merchandise ?
And for longing left to moan
The prohibitionists spent their money in vain
And that apocalypse turns thee pale ;
Where they pass a dread existence ,
That his hand was stretched to seize him ,
There grows a joy ! "
The moods have laid their hands across my hair :
That warmed the hearts of our visitors .
The chill 'd splendor reluctantly waned in the deep
Where oft a hero fell with shame ,
Too soon i found my fault !
For the loneliness of sorrow seems to flow
Where clubs from different cities came
" and it shall go hard but i contrive
" there runs thy friend to hang himself , --
As heaven and nature meant mankind should be !
No stain from its breath is spread
Though rival kingdoms press its verdant sides :
But flooding tears nor wine can ever purge
Her rosial colour comes and goes
A hero they would follow .
In the south was spread the rumour ;
I scarce can deem that my despair will die ,
Than the meeting waters make .
Those gone creations buried in the last !
No poet who hath weaved them in his lay .
And all the opal 'd air in color bound .
There sprang an armed man ! )
And i there faced the mystery of pain .
He ceased : and angad raised a cry ;
The spindle follows , and displays the charms
In her eyes the tears were standing ,
And leave a blaze of fireworks in your wake .
And the still water caught the lavished gold ,
Who with such treachery tries their hearts to move ,
Brave was the arm that humbled harold 's crest ,
Each takes new courage at the hero ’s sight ;
Can she be dead , or rooted in pain ?
And it makes his heart rejoice .
Worth all the argosies wave ever bore .
That for my faults ye will me gently beat .
What ! silent still ? since when has virtue grown
Far she followed and called and pleaded ,
To match the blessings of the future state ,
Least he after marriage find times go hard ,
What is the issue ? let us see !
Tainted the pools , the fodder charged with bane .
And all the comforts that their means afford .
That bounds the sea and land .
Test him , and pass sentence on him ?
There lay the lightning of the skies ;
Is built ; and therefore substance it intends .
Straucht took the rue ,
Which homer 's finger thrilled along ;
Many great souls have gone to rest , and sleep
But they go driven , straining back with fear ,
His boon companions follow still .
The long-neglected son 's debts pay .
Which in the former act had been displayed ;
There freedom in triumph an altar has made
Part of the christian people should be set ,
Of fine honey-dew which falleth often
If thou the truth wouldst teach . " _
That curls the waves on summer seas ;
Oft comes the pestilence upon the kine ,
Where files of time-marked veterans come
Like one that had been led astray
Who danger and the dead had faced ,
The sun had drained the earth that lay
Lies dead with years that never can return .
Which , though it rises over time and space ,
She to the crown by treason came ;
The king sought rest within his vaulted room .
When twilight over the mountains fluttered ,
And word is brought to our royall queene
At length there comes a musket-ball ,
And every nation , that should lift again
Don john of austria is going to the war ,
A vastness , as a neighbor , came , --
So runs the legend -- in mid-ocean lies
I now was of the arch that passes there ;
He took a tavern-bed that night ,
Against the hopeless life that ran
All round had faded , leaving me alone :
For the deceitful counsel which he gave .
Give them healthful rest and slumber ;
Feel a heavy sleep approaching .
In some still foliage it had found its nest :
A smile that seems to say
And broken the saints for bread !
Where gloomy forests round him rise ,
The furnace licked and purred and rolled ,
Going on with love 's wonder-work still ?
Cowards too may give attention ;
By fleecy clouds and summer sunshine kissed .
So my heart shall twine unsleeping ,
Your heavy sorrows , too , are flown .
And the bold deer shall drag the trembling hound .
To yonder gloomy dungeon turn your eyes ;
Of glorious greece nor feel his spirit rise
I shall clasp him close , casting out coldness ,
How exquisite thy voice would come ,
Wouldst tear from him ? his years in solitude
' what will bring the effervescence ,
In that rare loveliness which pleased all eyes .
What comes of all our ' ologies .
Gold the feet that bear it .
Around the yard , their nightly fast to break ,
Sire , love seeks nothing that kings can bestow .
Who for fresh nuptials joyfully yield all else ?
On this altar 's steps were laid
And all his verse immortal made .
Where one i love will shine supreme ! --
That fed from out her hand ,
His firm resolve he tarries to fulfil .
Sweet one , make haste and know him too ,
The woman went her ways , the potion made ,
Cheering , sustaining by their limpid tide ,
That hearty sorrow feeds on tears .
Fell only when deucalion 's deluge came ,
Has fallen to dim the rose 's pride .
My song might shadow forth that saintly smile ,
Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced ;
And the best part in talk with merlin spends ;
When fifty years are passed .
Than nature here has given ;
Strong , seeking cleanliness in truth , her hand
That would make your blood run cold ;
But take in trust my road ;
And wept , to find no safety there .
While to the very skies the seas should roll
The master 's confidence -- which he retained ;
Can bring to light to stand the light . "
Full-armed the fear was born and grew ,
And leave the rest to fancy 's dream .
When sable night the azure skies shall hide . "
You and i have found the joy had birth
Had lit their glorious eyes with fire ,
Answered in the words that follow :
Which on the living closed the tomb :
From nature 's god which freely came ,
Through her should hear and see the very truth .
_ the trail they blazed was gory ;
To which no weak remission comes
From his purse drew out a thousand ducats ,
Eyes made for glory soon discover thee .
Stern duty demands it -- why should they falter
Thus as she spoke , in helen 's breast arose
There honour comes , a pilgrim gray ,
And wilderness of ravenous deaths that stood
My weary side to raise ,
This said , patroclus to the battle flies ;
Sending his voice before him ? mighty rain !
As doth your rational ; and both contain
A storm-sweet lark rose in the blue :
If troy were standing , as in ancient day ,
With the affright that from her aspect came ,
They cling and close some minutes of the night .
White dream drifting , never changing above them :
To fall in banquet than in war !
Till she entered a convent and took the veil --
At last each thought was told ; with eager eyes
Florello lately cast on this rude coast
The stradivarius undo her mood .
Her brown hands clung -- her face grew pale --
While fires of woe consumed her , such
But the ears served not for hearing ,
I 'll meet the raging of the skies ,
And , moved by faithful love , i pray .
Thine is a joyance passing utterance ,
The breezes their own languor lent ,
A tyrant humbled , and a world relieved .
Hate , envy , oft the douglas bore ,
Cold , dreary cold , the stormy winds feel they
Where commonplaces , there that settle ,
The patter of his pinky feet makes music everywhere ,
Bold immortal country whose hill tops have stood
He felt she was gone -- gone forever !
Its sessions form our only almanack .
With its own silent fancies shining .
Has made the child cry .
It came upon the midnight clear ,
Shone pale with th ' communicated god .
That chases phantoms over shifting sands ;
Where contemplation finds her sacred spring ,
And the faded hue it wears .
With baronage and joy they bring him in .
As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide .
The waters against her crowded up .
And catch the burning sparks that fly
Arrest the yet unfolded roll of fate ,
She took her way , to dwell alone
The hurts we 've gotten in the strife .
My heart doth charge the watch ; the morning rise
The half-spun cord of sleep to snap ,
It has got to such a pitch ,
And fearless heart , make him renowned far .
Of dying either death , by both is sped .
To show their deadly rage .
That speaks thy altered vow ,
Let him that made mankind , the angels and devils
The ice-green light shall lie ,
The rabbi abraham haceba , flits
Love , and thine eyes instinctive seek the heaven ;
Leans to accompany the tranquil air ,
John made his triple bows , and kneeling down ,
Which keeps my fancy calm , i hear ,
And a cold wind swept over the flood that came
With their green shores reflected there
And when they reached the camp the king himself
Erewhile , by solemn consecration , given
More furiously still they go on swilling ,
On -- on he hastened , and he drew
But alfred smiles superior love
My sword is bathed in heaven , filled with blood
To quicken the blood that ran
Watching the water running to the sea ,
That his hand shall reap the harvest , undisturbed
Till you strike at life and hate it ,
As the swift seasons roll ! " _
I fell in love with laura lilly .
In the toils of guilt to snare me --
Disdainful or unconscious , held his course .
Proudly he treads the village green ;
It fell in the dusk of the night
" thy life will be unfolded like the rose ,
Such have not seen themselves sunk in depravity .
No one came to give him greeting ,
From the springs arise in beauty ,
The immortal barrier closed -- " not yet , "
Its pride is born of heroes bold
A tempered peace where nature 's peace is pure ?
He knew not what the radiance meant ,
Crimson swims the sunset over far pelorus ;
Tore me , and took my life .
Speech as of powers whose uttered word laid bare
All her nerves are strung to flight .
God gave it me ; but sin passed over it
Where peace was wreck 'd , and honour lost .
He finds in the chill , waning day ,
Painless and swift , set free her airy soul ,
That can tend thy royal racer .
The clouds hang over it , heavy and gray ,
And all his joys in length of wishes lost .
Sometimes i ioy when glad occasion fits ,
A bolt of living thunder downward hurled .
" that makes the life more beautiful , we bind
Prone on the pavement , trembling at his fate .
On him the storm of angry grief must burst .
Beyond the close , smothering the wholesome corn ,
Fierce the battle that will follow .
For who can match achilles ? he who can ,
Filling the air with praise ,
Of rapture ends , and she returns to life ,
Who thus in turn his speech renewed :
The utmost border of his kingdom , left
" ten thousand thanks ; how very few get ,
And found it suddenly shine with an inner splendor ?
Trill truths that echo to the highest heaven ,
That the wood-nymph 's call may echo ,
And now i feel those kisses on my mouth ,
His arms around his brothers cast .
Before the god they led the demon-man ,
We passed through the cycles strange ,
O love that passes the love of woman !
Against these bandits . you could trace with red ,
To reverse and undo the unholy spell .
This makes my conscience hard to heal ! --
Full of jokes as he can hold ;
I closed and drew for my love 's sake ,
At last one weighty blow descended :
My countrymen , i see !
No fault in women , to lay on
In bond of virtuous love together tied ,
' twill serve to mind thee of an english spring
With that heaven gave thee with a wary hand ,
Thus heavenward all things tend . for all were once
And thy empire extends over regions wide ;
To his rapt gaze there stole the rays divine
And left him alone with his shame and sin .
The battle closes deep and bloody ;
But bright cecilia raised the wonder higher :
Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil ,
As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form ,
When dews of dusk are falling ,
In the fight shall find his death-wound ,
So the thrushes took their nest ,
Trumpet and fife swelling choral along ,
I see her eyes shine through the mist ;
On which he made at nightes melody ,
Till the waves washed through the rib-bones ,
To friendly ties in honour bound ,
He leans on invisible angels ,
The season comes when first we met ,
His bursting sympathy for woe :
She that still held her weeping visage low ,
I have clinched and closed with the naked north ,
Dying the death whose signs remain
No blink of blue that a cloud lets through
And how fast that light was going .
In such a mansion , as scarce thought finds words
And find the lonely harvest of the night
The wild wine shed as blood on me
But the same passion i had given
The wind was rising loud and hie ;
They cut the wave with the living oar
Where he for debt was laid .
Then to carlsbad we will swing ;
And i pay dear with sorrow for brief song .
Oh , there are breasts to bear his head ,
What gospels lost the woods retrieve ,
That steep and narrow scale admits to climb .
Leave all the fears of your future to fate !
The fields where once the trojan towers did stand ,
He took the brand : with utmost heed
In the red , the flames still feeding
Break forth as laughter on lips that said
Take pains with vats and with milk cans .
Nor fits it to prolong the heavenly feast ,
Now howls the wind and drives the snow ;
Joy runs with a passion of swiftness
With which came settlers on kind thoughts intent .
In that , all lines of symmetry did meet --
Costentinnoble which allegiance paid ,
Where none but elders laid their head ;
So cheerful in converse you always would find ,
He gave a roar of awful sound
That the spring days soon will reach us ,
Friends we trusted , leaned upon ;
How such authority is given
They reached the grave , where she with firmness stood
By surest steps builds up prosperity . "
That still will boast your pride until the doom ,
' what will bring the effervescence ,
He would set to the baptist willingly ,
Faith is sworn to our emprise ,
With their quiet prayers did meet
Wives of his sire , paid reverence due .
As severed hearts through love made one .
In safety goes the glorious cavalier .
The overstrained spirit doth possess .
We parted : months and years rolled by ;
A wreath reflecting of eternal beams .
New flowery scents strewed everywhere ,
Shall yield him honor more than he hath lost !
We trust they find a happier land ,
Of every line her glowing body took ;
Will bring enough of sorrow . "
That in thy sweets all sweets encloses ,
The tinkling chimes ran out athwart the air ,
Such words , disturbed in grief , they said :
She gave with joy her virgin breast ;
That he hath set his conscience ;
To blast or ban a mortal hope or faith .
For in thy womb rekindling shone the love
A wicked ambush , which lay hidden long
What bouquet thus breathes from falernian jars ?
And perfect found in chivalry ,
Thus raghu ’s son his answer made :
Making us faint with overstrong desire
Cast fruitless sorrow from thy soul ,
Turn all thy thoughts to eyes ( campion )
So that i draw the breath of finer air ,
That kindly death was struck with pity --
The heaven the creeds bestow .
In scornful words this bitter scoff gave he .
Warmth came and earthy motives fresh and wild .
Never make sick your banks by surfeiting .
The panting breeze has set my lips afire ;
On doric pillars of white marble reared ,
And note you which is the greater blot ,
Feel the hard veil that iron centuries wear
Yes , as the seasons come and go ,
Following the motion of his hand she saw
Murder foul can never reach him there .
Dreadful as a battle arrayed ,
This answer to the saint addressed :
In all the regions failed to see
Nor doth god 's light match light shed over me
Keen in cunning might count or estimate ;
An ancestry who wore a kingly grace ,
Fell without fault , our quarrel to maintain .
Our soul of life is calling from the strand ,
And take the lovers unaware .
And banish the pain i feel .
So the days went by , and the summer wore
What numbers do the soul compose ;
The moonlight says .
Much more than i relate between us pass 'd :
From butchery ? that back again hath brought her
Closed are the blithe and fragrant lips which made
But fell the starry influence short ,
And at thy feet my kingdom lay .
Ráma , in bonds of duty held ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
The tent is struck , the vision stays ; --
In all the world than this which lay so calm
Now let us homeward go , they say ;
Oppressors ' hearts with justice learned to beat ,
Then rose the long lament
To hold communion with her heart ,
The curtain fell for a time ; and i fancied
The blue air rushes above my ceiling ,
So let these songs their story tell
Their flag to april 's breeze unfurled ,
Another athens shall arise ,
Transported with the view , i 'm lost
Like fatima , holds the key
The night can sweat with terror as before
Still found their harmless pleasures pure and sweet ;
Prove that the soul 's depths boil in earnest !
That beats aye for thine and thee .
Thus , as his sense of right directed ,
Life glistens on the river of the death .
Sorrow passed , and plucked the golden blossom ;
This in a moment fetched the angel swift ,
On the cold grave where all my sorrows rest ?
Such disposition made , shall both appear ;
The lamb reached the end of his tether
But his sagacious eye an inmate owns :
In gardens you may note amid the dearth ,
The melancholy waters lie .
I 'll tip this solemn warning :
And forests , fired with bacchic frenzy , ply
They shrink at sense of secret sin ,
But the sweetest spice will not be seen ,
By duty led , the king and queen ,
And draw thee to me like a mournful child .
Which made me greedy of embracing them .
A diamond for ever should it mark .
Away then went the stores of grain , --
It grieved when the forest was forced to fall ,
That separates the child from woman divine .
Thy patience then fail 'd not , till prudence found
My joys to thee i bring ,
How do these starry notes proclaim
That light lies hid from men ;
His eyes brimmed over with tears of joy . '
Could never lead thee otherwhere from me .
Made such a voluble answer promising all ,
That made men find an oracle in the books
The frequency of crimes has washed them white ,
In love and light her melodies expire .
Far from my bosom drive the low desire ;
His face with lines of firmness wrought ,
And longing lips set downward brightening
Great cities rise and have their fall ; the brass
Fresh confidence infused . then hector smote
The time has come to renounce him .
The while was draped with care , his tongue
Till the evening shall have gathered .
Than night , to spread throughout this earthly ball ,
They dancing went .
Even power immense had found such battle hard .
Still follow sense , of every art the soul ;
An host , makes no kings title good ,
To low-born arrogance to bend ,
And the flames arose in fury .
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking ,
Not wishing wealth , or spurning it ,
Wasted and worn by devilish incantations !
Exposed to hazard of so far sought war ,
The flames climb round it with a fierce embrace ,
And let na the sea come in . "
The mellow autumn came , and with it came
To bring me country news .
The amethyst deepened to a royal tone
How much of beauty nature holds beside
Lay the monster mishe-nahma ,
The dream that never dies .
Parted , alas ! i carry from its source ,
And down him ran the sweat ,
My heart will keep the courage of the quest ,
Thus he showed his heart was kind --
From dying pallas , and in triumph wore .
Together driven , all hope , all courage lost .
New fears would awaken new hopes in his life .
And they found industry had still its merits .
No new poems his brush will trace :
The purest hearts are led astray .
And short to them a tedious distance made :
A trembling seizes me , tears fill mine eyes ,
Delights to laud their ancient name .
On him in childlike faith is stayed !
A sadder strain mixed with their song ,
Into a champion of my race , made strong
That fire beneath , whose fury stifled lay :
So mine still stay in dreams .
Through him and her pressed
That touched our spring with golden scent ;
The years have gathered grayly
Sign for carnage gave he none .
See if thou canst pay the tribute ,
Thine hours to poetry are lent ,
The emphasis of death makes manifest
Scorned of everie one which by it went ;
And death with interest shall the debt repay . "
Men feel at the word , hypocrite .
The armies fade , the lustre dies .
That all recurring joy is pain refined ,
For he gave back for weariness ,
And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade
And that remaining sage , to follow her .
Entering thy home delightful peace he found ;
Then from their love a mighty child shall rise ,
Suns go on forever shining ;
And feel your souls around me hum
Dry fuel on the fire he laid ,
Treachery may be faced with light ,
I have spilled the blood of my foes
The way went under cedared gloom
Grown weary , gave me answer and
Panic , despair , flee away .
The silence broke , and thus their errors told :
Secure in sleep . the fury laid aside
From him renowned kakutstha came :
When sweet airs come seaward
The rest allow his choice , and fortune praise ,
All that country lightens and shines again :
Hacks us thus cruelly , slivering again
How joys approach when sorrows shrink .
Fancy into belief : anon it leads
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths ,
But what can make the hours seem lang ,
And such a spell around them made
But sorrow returned with the dawning of morn ,
Till snow gives way where he doth tread .
Upon his shadowy life from her shall fall ?
Flowers and odors sweetly smiled and smelled ,
The lord of christmas stands :
In mid assembly , and his message gave :
While my childhood 's years were passing .
That but to pity her is to embrace .
The mingling notes came soften 'd from below :
Outwards rush the strong pale clouds ,
Let not the grief in you be shown ,
More tears than they could hold ,
That promises health to its fibers .
And dreams went along her veins , and scattering clouds
Where shattered day in fragments lay ,
And gentle voice that comes to you ,
Dissembled , and this answer smooth returned : --
To watch this quarter , my adventure falls :
I bathed in bliss-exhaling balm .
Many lands long seeking . till from a crest
" for ever wilt thou heave the bursting sigh ?
Incense he sprinkles in the primal flames
And snort to meet the prickly sight ;
Or women that could no resistance make :
Houses and holy temples float in blood ,
Gray on the budding woods the morning hasted ,
Thy promise my faith shall sustain ;
They come from beds of lichen green ,
Calm seas that lie ' neath summer skies
Wherein true love consists not ; love refines
Which holds three persons in one substance knit .
And the summit rose to heaven ,
In vain was reason given , if man therewith
Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet ,
That just set the palate itchin ' ;
The wind that bends the pliant trees ,
And discord follow upon unison ,
Oh , i wish the winter would go ,
Of cloud to break and pass , nor rent
For the moment that a garland takes to twine ,
Made her heart beat more than thunder .
Out of his eyes flashed a consuming fire ,
Or mean or small , can touch my heart ....
Yes , but who made them fight ,
Close union with the godhead gained .
To-morrow 's tangle to itself resign .
And buzzards to scripture give any credence ,
A sickly perfume . but the sundew catches
Until the spring had come .
He finds in the chill , waning day ,
A constant trade-wind will securely blow ,
Touch 'd with the mountain 's melancholy prayer
While slow mists gather in shrouding tears
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking ,
The day arrived ; the sun was shining brightly
Winding his voice along the dells ,
The parliament then proceeded against the conspirators , and
Till he came where the column of moonshine lay ,
With birds that flitted feathered in the dappling ,
If kings are made the people to enthral ,
“ yet should the deadly blow be given by one
And i will make thy pathway clear ,
Again the foe discharge the steely shower ;
Which i have planted with this hand --
Her fresh and virgin hands lie on the fret
And from its death the other drew fresh life ,
And buries madmen in the heaps they raise .
Making the star seem silver streak 'd with gold .
On that fair path which leads to heavenly birth !
Bitter and cold is the hate they hold --
Like reeling moths around a candle light ,
A feeling that would not let him rest .
Earth calls thee blind , misguided one , --
As ever bacchus listed !
Our fathers held by purchase ,
And gathering tears his eyes bedewed .
Tidings send to hiawatha ! "
Who captive led captivity --
By those fair bodies that its splendour pressed .
Which winthrop adams after put to verses .
It spoke the dawn of his natal day ,
There rembrandt made his darkness equal light ,
And earth lay sere and darkling as distraught ,
Fire will thrust beneath my shoestrings ,
Which comes of even mood ; --
That seems to thrust aloft its fearful head
Shall the same tragedy be played anew ,
She has no strong white arms to fold you ,
It feels the wings , and wants the sky .
I have hope to find lofty fame hereafter .
And passionate spirits burst their clayey shells
Will serve to keep the world thy friend :
Who is she here that now i see ,
Though all those waves went over us , and drove
Rose beating lustrous wings , but ilsabe --
I hung my verses in the wind .
Why slept the sword , omnipotent to save ?
He counts it as no sin
Veils pass , and laughing fellowship glows warm .
Of nile , when winter falls , in casual lines
The tempest is raging .
Rush into blood , the sack of cities seek ;
New op ' ning views the smiling fates bestow .
I choose this one and put it into rhyme ,
His heart kept vigil by the little house
Labour and rest , that equal periods keep ;
Who never deeply felt , nor clearly will 'd ,
Against each piled injustice . ay , the least ,
Accountable , made haste , to make appear ,
Till you drew from the shade ,
His kingdom by himself controlled ,
And that hideous smoke meant death .
Till i felt my heart and courage sinking
To witness ! such the faith which fortune kept
The air is sweet with violets running wild
Where fixed , as if one prayer could heal ,
Across the waste of waters towards him draw ;
Fed duly ; juno gave them to surpass
He stuffed his hold with the sunset sky !
And a wreck shall drift to some unknown shore
Till it assume that state which they require .
How oft , when grief has made me fly ,
Thy fancies come from emerald plots ,
My weaker genius -- cross to fashion --
Whose intricate fingers beat and glide
Where never a kiss could come .
But lift the tender edges lightly ;
Spring came again , and the flowers rose
Grim vengeance yet shall whet a sword
Though seventy-six , i feel i still
The paynim numbers which about him flowed .
But the tears came trickling from his eyes
The cottage stood ; and near the humming hives
Did not the boast the charms proclaim ?
Moving unto the words their little flames .
To all that fortune can bestow ,
To fire ; from which there would descend on earth
And follow both the bridegroom ; so the bride
Of rushing at each little girl you meet
Shouts echo shouts . -- with stern , disdainful eyes
Our force successful shall our threat make good ,
Its leaves by soft winds fanned ;
-- now another day is come ,
Should scan such secret truth ; for he had learnt
That unto life new energies impart ,
And never feel a tremor , bat an eye .
Whose chords send forth that touching melody .
The violet , gazing on the arch of blue
Had been mine that shared her book
A sea that heaves with horror of the night ,
So like the simple truth appears her say ,
Or break thy sinful vow :
Everything they took from my new poem book
For his agony to pass ;
For having lost but once your prime ,
Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal 'd .
And , ah , how find the tender word
Raised reverent hands , and told him all ,
Thus bound by oath , the king our lord
To be found in a family quarrel ! "
Month-long ran a summer-squirrel
For the poor make no new friends ;
Told the sleeping troops that the dawn had come ,
It gave us momentary alarm ,
His power to do or guard from harm ;
Which glittered as it rolled ,
In terror , and a horrid dew dripped from the
Has crusted and changed in secrecy and silence ,
With trees and skies to shine through them ,
What best i see in thee
Where purple fox-grapes hang their store ,
Then lose the cares of life in pleasing rest .
Of humble human being , held the ground .
And when thanksgiving came ,
Like that which lifts , through centuries ,
That saw his royal standard laid on ground ,
A common pathway follow ,
As our sad thoughts are wandering grim and slow ,
So , many months passed on : and once again
Hath raised the standard of revolt against thee .
Thy name was borne on every breeze ,
Some new task every day he finds ,
It comes from the dust , and bending over .
Two lives made one , the man and wife
To gain her longed-for wished release ,
The burthen hid a bonnet blue ,
His ears cocked up as his blood ran higher ,
And when the battle fell away at night
Her rose-smile showed so plainly ,
A mournful wind across the landscape flies ,
For the streets run over with sunlight and spill
And with its too harsh kisses break the reed
Passing that way his benediction give .
To lay a heavy weight upon my conscience
She shines on thieves on the garden wall ,
And he rushes on the thirty heroes .
Driven by the bomb 's incessant thunder-stroke
Lo , poverty , to fill the band ,
More active came within my ken . the dial
For any subterfuge would swing my gate .
To mix her wild vagaries with thy laws .
Oh , how they fire the heart devout ,
The skies alone supply the hollowed rock
And autumn lingers but to outsmile the may ;
Lay him down in hope and faith ,
Or stand in mute pain lingering , till they drop
Both were mine ! life went a-maying
Have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay ,
Like music that sorrow had steeped in her tears .
The court pronounces the defendant -- dead !
From his footprints flowed a river ,
To smother bitter thoughts with patience meek ,
Each one find good fortune bringing ,
These all are wrought on matter by the soul !
Where her first kiss she gave ,
As banished hope , and still increased fear .
The hour the wind has ceased to blow ?
That lay in the house that jack built .
To seek for beauty everywhere ,
And through the word our laugh did run
Always shocked by war ’s alarms ,
His angry eyes that glowed and burned .
When through its bowers cool the breezes creep .
While christ 's love fell like healing dew :
" the ebbing tide has left the sand
The morning came , the chaise was brought ,
Was filled with accents of despair ,
For his agony to pass ;
Till scarce a drop of rain could pass
In present hours as in years gone by !
But , naught the blind , indifferent stars revealed ,
These purple currents hedg 'd with violets round .
It bears aloft the blossom gay
Still shines the light of holy lives , 67 .
Dropping december shall come weeping in ,
In order to behold your punishments . "
And bore me in your arms about the house
For dead achilles . then the argives gave
And the lasting joy that a purpose brings .
When my sails are filled with south-winds ,
Among the rest recalled a mutual pledge ,
Before the post goes ,
Such eyes had sought across the sea ,
War 's deadly lightning swiftly fell ,
As that their hearts to change do not incline ,
And tho ' ere long her sanguine spirit rose
Styx with her ninefold barrier poured between .
That in the soul shall its foundations find
Singing to words that match the sense of these
His own small flock each senator did keep .
The sounding storm that sweeps the rugged isle ,
That the last post is given unto you ,
Take heed thou mix not with the crowd ,
By name to come called charity , the soul
The wind has slackened but dark clouds affright ,
That sticks on the old score .
Or depths to fathom , made our glee ;
The one that went before , holds and caresses ;
Ye see , the home war n't jest the place
To spring into shining blades of swords ,
In that good world to which they led ;
But more on him who gave her such delight .
And dark and silent the water lies ;
Now , reassured , again drew nigh :
For even then there came that sterner voice ,
Or framed your thoughts in a well measured line ;
The blood having touched it , contracting and shrivelling
Beneath the lamp of truth i am found untrue ,
It would not reach , singing the holy smile
Bearing the treasures of the unsearched deep
Upon the beaming face of joy had dried .
To thy best works assigned by fate .
Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal ,
As i praised god and gave thanks to him .
So passes with the dying hymn
Tears unlock my heavy eyelids ,
Shall our warm tears descend like rain
It breaks his heart that kings must murder still ,
The smoke of the burning woods ascended .
Reached not the heart that courage kept
That little violet wrought .
Plainly refused ; that i may know and feel
Which made us wish it yet might last , --
The beltan winds blew loud and lang ,
Nay this great city may be lost in flames ,
Life more abundantly give everything :
Where the weary toiler lay ,
In cannon held dispute .
Such wondrous slumber falls
Its proper power to hurt , each creature feels ;
For it banishes all my pain ;
With my attendants follow fast the mules
His silver sound would touch our tickled eare :
Till an indian paper found that he could write :
My soul takes wing to meet the heavenly strain ;
Too weak to put aside the utter ache
The gentle winds distend the snowy sails .
And , pierced with anguish at the view ,
Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled .
Close scanned her old deserted home . then came
Win my heart and then deceive me ?
Her soul had spoken and confess 'd its lie :
As pensive i stray 'd in her elegant shade ,
To give new pleasure like the past ,
Amang his caves , the sigh he gave --
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff :
Since lips that sang , i love thee ,
Now a faint light lit up the southern sky ,
Killing a circus dead : god give me peace ;
The silence enters , and the talkers stare .
But wandering flocks assume the well known way
Have issued to the heaven that is pure light ;
That came in neptune 's plea .
Heaving and sinking , helped him to believe
For she felt so alone -- three times in vain
For him no pension pours its annual fruits ,
And mourners went about the place ,
Seven years had gone , when issa came again ,
The poets that cover the countryside !
But gather the glory of the year ,
Of the strange creeds priests hold so dear ,
Twined in the passionate embrace of love .
With wise and soothing words addressed
What thou hast uttered comes not from thy heart .
For our day is dead and has left no traces
Still sacred , though thy name be breathed
Curling lips which earth has kissed ,
Where deep and low the hamlets lie
And faces long vanished peer out into sight .
Of herbs that line thy oozy banks ;
And never more shall sin its whiteness stain , --
I lay my hand in thine ,
The hour yet bears for thee and me
Which held the sacred dust that friendship gave .
See the whole vision be made manifest .
To mark where england 's province stands --
Lay hold on life and liberty , and sing .
" in stars that wink or flowers that blow ,
Would you give him a pitcher like clarkson ?
A sharp and clashing noise the stillness broke ,
The moonbeams kissed with light ;
And ere the leaves could urge their prayer ,
That scattered their fragrance around ?
Beyond the sin of earth , in heavens prepared --
And prays beside her ! many years have shed
As king , thou must stand higher than all men
Who in their courts unrighteous judgments pass ,
And those sunk eyes now lost to earth
As the thunder flung from the strong unclosing
I watched when the great vision came to thee ,
The might of purushottam lay ,
The evening falls , the moon is golden .
All nature smiled , in loveliest green confessed ,
At his own side placed theoclymenus .
The glory from his gray hairs gone
The council met debating how to join
Such converse held they ; all the space meanwhile
And every hair with anger stirred .
Of strength that runs itself to waste in strife ?
Their own destruction to come speedy upon them .
Dream of a night forever flown .
Swing and return to shift the sun anew .
But kisses thrown from heaven to win us back ?
Is lost in love ! thou great philanthropist !
Though the contrast oft produced a sigh ;
( the answer comes by proxy . )
The echoes could not catch the swell .
But when my sun her shining twins there bends ;
Smile , half revealed , a mingled scene .
Seeking to find the path that leads to peace .
A breeze came from the south ,
That makes the parting less of pain --
I 'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul ,
We court disaster , crave the fatal sword .
To lead on earth an angel 's life .
Pieria 's roses twined about my brow .
With glittering lights that hide her ghastly woes ;
" no lonely life had pass 'd too slow ,
One little boat gave up its strife ,
Or the winds anger , borne away
All these divine philosophy explores ,
And the rich came not to won ,
His brighter petals down to make them fair ;
And that made my cheek so pale ?
Ruler of what thou camest to redeem ;
Winter set glittering on top of an old yew .
That to which darker hours gave birth
Cliffs that front the swelling tide ;
To womanhood belongs forgiveness too ,
Which mocked my eager rage of late ;
Like a thing of smoke it crossed the sky ,
Before they reach 'd a spot to take effect :
The mingling notes came softened from below ;
Campagna fogs up there now reach ,
Which was acquired while weeping in the exile
As a war-ship she prepared it .
The tilbury way went on without him .
Ring out the grief that saps the mind ,
Strong in the charm the fairy gave the child .
And wrong side up , it settled
And took , as an expression of chagrin ,
To take earth 's wonder with surprise ?
If in the castle were that murder taught ;
With its caverns of burning light :
Thou shouldst have made her mercy more .
No pleasure shamed the gods of that young race ;
Its living germ has never lost .
But now it is come to this ,
To lift some weight with sick assay ,
When darkness falls ask god the path to show .
Those shades imploring , went beneath a weight
By conflict kind , that struck out latent truth ,
Home , for my heart still calls me ;
Sad o'er the mighty wreck in silence bends ,
To what serves mortal beauty ? _
Bleeding and torn from freedom 's mountain bounds ,
Out of the sunset dreamily rolled .
Where roll 'd its waves a silver winding flood ,
Who gives himself to solitude ,
To count my sorrows ere the day is spent ,
Which constantine to good sylvester made .
The centuries pass : the cycles roll along -
My weary , wasted life will peter out .
The urn held sweet the body 's sum , --
To richer beauty called the glance aside .
He shined in writing , and his wit displayed --
Quick to arms rose louhi 's people ,
Drawing and dragging her soul from its seat
Fraternal sympathy flies on
To quench the fervors of glowing passion !
Where benches stand expectant in the shade
While her ruby lips dispense
One thread in life worth spinning ,
Rumour and great acestes ' name had drawn
The stars swung out like bells and rang .
Nor lose the blissful sight of beauty 's truth ,
Gives back the bending heavens in dew .
Then lay him down and share her death --
The seasons pass , till on their hands they count
Like far sweet songs that come to us ,
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw :
To-morrow 's tangle to itself resign ,
And when vacation brings its hours of rest
And the dimpled light to spread ,
Merely facile flowing nonsense ,
And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare . "
Lightly went madala ,
So tangled in its custom 'd toils that smile
Now hurled them rolled as down a precipice
To find its meaning is my meat and drink .
More than those who caught life 's secret
The peace of tides that underlie our strife ,
That wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine
And this plant draws from the same air and soil
Of fairyland -- that showed you how to pluck
By universal ruin , and restore
To whom the archangel michael gave command ,
There rose the great whale 's skeleton .
Thou show ' st that same grave aspect everywhere ,
Entered their battle , felled them down around ,
And says in tones surcharged with dread ,
And round the rocks crept flowered vines ,
They waited surely , for his hour would come .
Of faded portraits in carved mouldings shone .
Lest back the awful door should spring ,
His heart leapt , as leaps the child
And this fresh kindness fullest proof affords
Are shedding tears as if their hearts would break ;
Than mine was , though it could not rise
And , wholly generous in the offering made ,
For this i gladly bear the toil and pain .
You could not find a grander ;
Then stirred within him a tumultuous joy ;
Take the blind years as they might run ,
All saw that he was fond of miss ,
I shouted aloud and my cries rent the air :
Things wear an aspect truly dark and dull .
Where new , returning aprils take the earth ;
For man doth build on an eternal scale ,
" earth bears no balsam for mistakes ;
But these will come to hand , at least
Near into where the water run .
Kaze he got a way ter know
And wave on wave in long succession follows ;
Mournful it tells , that the wind may know .
What time the pea puts on the bloom ,
Departing to his house , each sought repose .
Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart . "
Their faces , and he saw the tale was true
That tear which only feeling hearts can pay ;
Youngest green transfused in silver shining through :
Singing the solemn dirge that moves to tears ,
And give them strength to bear their boundless loss ,
Be all your acts in dark oblivion drowned ;
Nor break the white plaits with my feet .
The weapons at the rest to pieces went ;
Sweet with the lingering strains that echo stole ,
In wealth and multitude , factious they grow ;
As many miles aloft . that fury stay 'd ;
Still singing as they shine ,
Thus their prayer was raved and ceased .
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame ,
Earth trembled at each step they took ,
That i may weave , ere love be set ,
The delicate shells lay on the shore ;
The flashing sails , and held their christmas feast
Can cull some sweetest treasure ;
But even-paced come round the years ,
That shone around the galilean lake ,
" not all the mysteries that in us lie --
When spring brings back blue days and fair .
And great delight shall surely fill thy soul ,
The dark one , roused to reason , fell .
And when i 'm too old to follow ,
When all the strings of boyish life were stirred
And wealth to all its votaries give ;
Since so great a charm hangs o'er it ,
Where aye before god 's face his trumpets run ?
When maples stand in a haze of fire
On such a night of wind and piercing sleet ,
The last from stubborn iron took its name ; --
Nor turn them up to pray .
Sheer the precipice descends ,
Might gain a fellowship :
It serves its purpose passing well .
The sunny day had passed , the shades of night
Perchance that strange great eagle 's feather lay ,
It covers but not hides the sky .
He found the throne a dangerous post ,
That floats along the gilded shell ,
And hence it takes the nature of a substance .
My breast to the sun his torch shall hold ;
Ly , that it makes the meat more sweet ,
One night they longer stayed the tale to hear ,
Eternities to come ; but , all the while
And every feature radiating went
Themselves and broaden as the year goes down .
Me mightier transports move and thrill ;
Received her , and together they found rest .
Inflamed and opened , which he sought to close .
Like chilling sadness on my heart is flung ;
Bang went the gun -- she missed her mark !
How many kisses might it take -- and give .
And in words like these expressed him :
With eyes , as brightly turned upon him as
Marphisa raised her face with haughty cheer ,
Soft and thick the snow lay ,
Lost in this pleasing ecstasy ,
What kept the slothful warriors from their post ,
Slow to allay the lingering thirst of toil ?
Of the most radiant torch love ever bore ,
An ocean spreads between us and that goal ,
They shall not find the way to arcady ,
How a grief hidden feeds on its own mood ,
Contracting regal power to stretch their own ;
Was caught up into love , and taught the whole
Higgs raised -- as was but right --
Vapours not yet into her substance turned .
A woman whom they led to die ? the veil
That found the heavenly stair .
Where stiff silk roses range their bloom .
Where first our marriage-vows were given ,
Before her memory could his face retain .
And wrath and favour duly shows .
Black , more black grew the empty void ,
Have fame of him through the whole earth blown .
That shook heaven 's whole circumference confirmed .
Rage drops his steel , and storms grow calm :
Death is consoler and death brings to life ;
And then came peace , and gentle beauty came ,
Until at last ther ' come the end .
Light the devouring flames , by eddying winds
Putting forth my manly efforts ;
The day is lowering -- stilly black
Love stands upon thy left hand and thy right ,
And melt the silver in the stranger 's purse .
What have those lonely mountains worth revealing ?
Which the kind hermit bade him take ;
The baptist found him far too deep ;
And his soul leans out to the sweet wild snatches
For though the clouds ride high above ,
The noise of bells went sweeping by ;
And on him all their blessings shed ,
Till forging nature be condemn 'd of treason ,
Was melody blown through a reed ;
May time 's hard hand our footsteps guide apart ,
Long was his stay : my earnest eyes explore ,
He sees and feels the awful load of sin ,
And all the billows follow in its track :
The thoughts that moved his gallant breast :
Until as much time as he lived be passed ,
I have made fellowships --
Shrieks deeds of sin that man-wrecks wrought
With no police to follow ,
That lies in the triple-glowing light !
Who filled thy countenance with rosy light ?
Only when all our hold on life is troubled ,
The farce concluded , as it was foreseen --
Safer sport than making war ;
Fairly covered up you see !
His faith sank under earthly woes .
But felt that i was still alive --
While the sands o ' life shall run .
An ' raised a family .
Thereon the champions take their seat ,
And held communion with the angels . so
Like streams , that come from heavenward hills ,
Had gone against us , and the traitors slew
And this is what the weeping monarch rued ,
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
Wealth soon grew mine , the parasital fame
That there once stood an isle as rich and fair
This is not reason 's dictate ; reason says ,
Where bountiful symaethus leads
Branches they bore of that enchanted stem ,
Summer is come , for every spray now springs :
Such anguish he had never felt before .
To build for passion an eternal song ,
But the strongest frame comes to shun the strife
And , holy vows of lasting friendship bring
Unless a few days bring a great change about ,
A lean , red finger pointing to the sky ,
With me in echoing groves the song to raise ,
I said he must resign , or stand
Of turf ; sacred to hecate stood the right ,
The little of hair that his cropped pate bore ,
And then they sank in a blissful swoon ,
Which we set in crystal air
According as they come . '
Loud pealed the thunder
" o gentle wind , that bloweth south ,
The wind shifts and i fly into a rage .
Hateful thy chidings grow ; each breeze doth bring
The finger of glory shall point where they lie ;
Follow it , follow that far ideal ! --
With the first dream that comes with the first sleep
But when her love lay cold in death ,
Gave me to face the orient . nor our way
Turning some portion of the blame away ;
Trodden in vain till he regain the path .
The eagles floated , struggling with the wind .
Dreamed the inevitable blow could fall ,
At thy touch put glory on .
And the well wealded metal 's temper tried ,
And the night has come , and planets glinted ,
And knew the blows the hero dealt ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
Thin and melancholy voices faintly murmur through the gloom ;
And let it openly proclame
As they take the aisle ?
And ancient china made the parlour gay ;
And shed the life stream from still healthy veins .
All these years have sought to honor ,
That ever in battle fell .
And tears for yourself controlled ,
A chieftain 's vengeance thou shalt feel .
This is the dream that came of the dark .
The manner of my falling into sleep .
What time it chanced the palace entertain 'd ,
There came a voice without reply :
Alone , without exteriour help sustained ?
And the cash that goes therewith !
Could not have added terror to her breath .
And the clouds lift on high
With fuller profits lead an easier life ,
Let me in silence drink my bitter tears .
Wherein the lamplight , scattered and sick and pale ,
The fellowship of wild companions kept ,
Gives a melancholy howl , and -- dies !
His firm-set spirit can not move . "
And joyous thoughts my bosom sway ,
When danger threatens , lay it on thy heart ;
The clouds build castles in the air ,
Of autumn wrap themselves in haze ,
The twilight heavens are flushed with gathering light ,
Nor , save when counsel shows the need ,
Where green-clad hills are calmly lying .
That his strength might endure for a span --
Of which the coming life is made ,
A good news should be given .
And doubt on doubt like shadows shadows chase ?
The day came slow , till five o'clock ,
Hurling defiance toward the vault of heav ' n.
And trace them through the prospect as it lies :
And life is centred in another sphere ,
I always finds it good to eat .
And gives new life , unconscious that it gives .
His prosperous life has smoothly sped ,
The throb of the drums strikes up ,
Can he in aught beside find happiness ?
Doing nothing sits the chore boy , billy :
While , tumbling brown , the burn comes down ,
Love only can these wonders show .
To tell the mournful news he brought .
While his heart was filled with anguish ,
Stowing a syllable in every crack .
He stood as one who found and named
Into the vague , and left me musing there
The oars laid idle at the last .
Thou therefore take my brand excalibur ,
Still with their natural tints they spread
Of days that hovered and of years gone by .
All over , ease and wantonness declare ;
And none born can escape this thing .
So he wrote just whatever came into his head ,
His aspirations without wings would fly .
A writing , as he went ,
Our thoughts will reach this nook no more . "
Companion , friend , thy courage was betrayed
And grave . their silence waited for the queen :
Blood only serves to wash ambition 's hands !
In its blue blossoms hum themselves to sleep ;
A dewy blushing rose will sometimes spring ;
Streams of uncomprehending sadness pour ,
His eyes made up of wonder and love ;
The nectar that kindles the heart .
I will be what god made me , nor protest
While so the cavaliers their news declare ,
There goes the hearse , the mourners cry ,
Are tributes rendered to the dead ,
Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness .
Bianor 's tomb just rising to the eye .
And in her odorous bosom laid the gold .
My peerless consort ’s fate reveal .
This only solace his hard fortune sends .
In the annals of ages gone .
May lead you bye and bye through gloomy lanes
And ere it left their faces , through the cross
Like the birdlings the moments flew by .
Franks shall be slain , and france lie deserted .
But all so close the nymph hath laced it ,
And my heart it stounds wi ' anguish ,
All the dreams we dreamed came true .
A smile as that which lit the tide below ,
I have wrestled oft in prayer --
Another day let slip ! its hours have run ,
And breathes a living , feeling soul
The women charming , if one takes them rightly ;
Not death 's fixed calm could rase the trace
Noises of orgy and of rut are gliding ,
A double birth she brought , whose shoulders bear
As if that soul were fled .
With face to earth , his form he laid ,
And shadows , mists , and darkness , given .
This dread and direful combat , standing nigh ;
To bearded lips , while eye spoke unto eye .
And pass their own inventions off instead .
The hour her soul its farewell took ,
The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife ,
Have sorrows woven with delights ;
Which mocked its victims in that hour of fear ,
A magistrate just , by no party is swayed ;
Of aventine spread oft a lake of blood .
_ no wisdom won with weariness _ ;
Or dances where the violets lie .
Then do they spend their mouths : echo replies ,
That made a sinister whisper , loudly he walked .
Patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought ;
With downcast eye and cheek that burned :
From the earth thou springest ;
But the pine tree makes a symphony thereof .
Ah , from the soul itself must issue forth
For i know and i feel
There his first step lord vishṇu placed
Again th ' ideal scenes arise ,
Love grows in my heart .
Rakes the swift and boiling current
The wiser wits of later times declare ,
Where the pine-trees stand together ,
Long time lost to me ?
All my sense thy sweetness gained ;
Hills of promise gleaming bright ,
Till , his exhausted quiver yielding none ,
When all the village wrapped in slumber lay ,
Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear :
Yet hints come to me from the realm unknown ;
Shall make a clearer faith and manhood shine
And since the marriage-knot was tied ,
For the dark alleys where to-morrow lies .
The light he sought was born --
Of such sad cases , tears would fill his eyes
And scraps of joy my wandering ever finds
We have counted friend as foe ;
How roses first came red and lilies white ;
Wi horror some fainted , while others took fits ,
( may he find no cloud above ! )
Yet may i hold it in white chastity .
The boat hath left the lonesome rock ,
For a sooty hearth to rest on ;
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
Not all her knowledge uttered ; and her eyes ,
The wolf on the hills lays stealthy paws ,
My soul would find in flowers of thy ordaining
Like breadths of topaz , packed a night ,
So deep in earth his fix 'd foundations lie .
Found the lost-words of the master . "
That smile turns them all to light .
And not to keep an easy heart .
Whilst religion extends o'er those champions her shield ,
In this way they send news and get replies !
May in anguish be hid ' neath a smile .
Which it retain 'd ; binding with this the mast
Or paper turn 'd to money by the bank :
Where age and experience alone might debate .
So , by the bonds of duty pressed ,
With no contentment can themselves suffize ;
What crumbs that from the master 's table fell .
" that unavailing care be laid aside ,
That our great captain to the wind expands ,
Like joseph went they forth , or benjamin ,
Great ajax mark ’d the growing storm from far ,
Filled with roasted moths and things
They bathe themselves in ocean milky-white .
Prec . thank me by following it .
Which my sins made ,
That made or sign or show came to just ,
Just to give the day a scientific tone .
With wreaths from which the autumn takes no
To thee the laurels belong
The joys that wound , the pains that bless ,
Now turning to the summer .
Modest , as her blushing shows ,
Behind yon hill the sun escapes from sight ,
This said , our tears to-day may fall
Then -- take a word of warning ,
Could not escape the gentle julia 's eyes ;
My clay with long oblivion is gone dry :
Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches .
In voices mingled with sweet melody .
A silence kept for years and years .
And filled with glory that gloomy prison ,
The eve is thine which even now drops down ,
Each lost the colour that it once possessed ,
Through equal space , as practice skill hath shown ;
Such shapes return with christmas snow , --
And lifted its waters on high --
Who treads through blood and passes , time shall glance
As wake again one bliss they gave .
And the ware the merchant brings :
They are swept into illimitable abysses .
And the slain air got breath ; and after these
Faith merged at length in undisputed sight ,
They look to more than truth , and so confirm
That held the peach to the garden-wall .
Through the silence rings a piercing yell ;
Her summer mantle lightly threw .
The slumber of his lips meseems to run
Her fair and well wrought image , she disdain
Of half-conviction carried to a craze -
And the passionate strain that , deeply going ,
The third said it was a house ,
For the moon wandered witless of her way ,
The rash like thee , who spurn control ,
To name the bubbling hope that he is bringing .
Still like a shadow follows thee .
Ere sin had cast its with ' ring blight
That i should keep for you my fealty ?
And foes join foes to triumph in her fall .
Of lively colours flowing from the face .
Love gains the shrine when pity opes the door ;
In headlong torrents ran a tide of blood ,
Here shall the wandering stranger find his home ,
And nurse , with baby , run a race ,
Lights tip that mountain cavalcade ,
How easy every labour it pursues !
Mercy will set between ,
The charming hills that round it rise ,
Beneath which a god 's blood flows ;
The lukewarm blood came rushing thro ' the wound ,
So fared the county with the pagan bold ;
By brahmá ’s saving promise charmed ,
His strength had failed by slow decay ,
Give him the darkest inch your shelf allows ,
Again our queen 's conduct was made a review .
And in words like these expressed him :
" our spirits have climbed high
That onward came some space from whence i stood .
Then comes the magic hour when we are old ,
Where once a castle frowned , closes the scene .
Kindled , thy ken a higher flight shall mount ;
And they will scatter it , what moved in you
Ere the time be come for taking you .
And was approaching fast toward old age ;
The bees are lost amid the rout
No crumbling stone to whet ambition on ,
Brushed his knee . a light tremor went shivering down
Words told her of what peril there might be
As unknown valley-lovers follow love !
Leaves will hide me , too , made glad .
With lovers often passes as black gall --
That tell of sítá ’s noble life
Nor all her sweetness saved her from the tomb ,
So strange the music came .
Whose soul to morning radiance turns
And half of spain you shall hold in fee ,
Of all her foliage knew the cause ,
The dew sat chilly on her breast ,
What thought quick rushed across his soul ,
And so it pierced his sorrow to the core ,
And holds a void within its body , unless
Some sense of being , utter new , may come
In my unfailing praises now i store it .
And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries .
She finds the time dismally long ;
The tragic muse in all her terrors drest ,
Of linked sweetness long drawn out ,
The troubled tide , and struggles to the shore ?
From the north-east came in anger ,
Is your soul alive ? then let it feed !
My heart gave one wild bound , driving a wave
Their sighs and groans who draw a painful breath ,
Here rage enchained reluctant raves , and there
Its columns ranged like a martial band
The bubbles we pursue on earth ,
Like following life through creatures you dissect ,
Hands that the rod of empire might have swayed
Scorn to be made a bloody , murdering den ;
Fast climbed the sun : the flowers were flown ,
The world is grown so fond of getting cash ,
And midnight dangers that around us grew ,
Whose smiles of love are seen through broken tears ,
To cling to when the heart takes sanctuary ;
No bitter-almond trees make wan the night ,
My spirit flew in feathers then
Which was opened by servants so gay ,
For death and time must pass on echoing feet .
Had dealt such deaths amid his chivalry ,
There rested the heart of the woman , so lonely
Thy songs support me , and thy morals heal !
But natural necessity begot .
A safe retreat , where not a blast may shake
For in this union you have set
Fire to drive thee from my presence ,
And fairly filled with wide-eyed wonderment .
Ye staked , with this high energy indued ,
Which bore them to eternity -- they saw
Bespoke the fair from whence she sprung ,
Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy :
For the first time the soul feels joy ,
The big seas beat between ; and knows it skills
Like the drifting snow she sweeps
Her eyes are sapphires set in snow ,
God 's summons came :
What a wild mad thrill our veins would fill
Our thoughts go wandering ? ...
Waken the flowers , and scatter the dew ;
Water-fetching goes the noble
The clock struck one ,
The thoughts that move across this sky
He gives to range the dreary sky :
Is stored within a traitor 's kiss :
And when the sea does in upon them break ,
Till they cover the place of each sorrow ,
Reached king valdemar , the imperious ,
To deal mankind some fatal wound .
Where love found immortal wing ;
And from rebellion shall derive his name ,
To mark his features . dignity serene
Enforce those acts that tyranny did found ?
Long has my soul her inspirations felt .
Till lengthened on to faith , and unconfined ,
When cinderella reached the ball ,
The stranger ship went by .
The new-come , shrank and paled away
And as instructed , to christ 's laws attended .
The brown canals ran liquid bronze , for here
That rose alternate , row and row ,
The misty eve sits heavy on the sea ,
The leap against the sharpened spikes restrain .
And one to the other his passion revealed --
Who wrote the letters finds embarrassment .
Knew not thy hand withheld this last despair ,
Where the misty waters pour .
Many would say , that oaths unbinding are ,
Still was the room where his days he spent ,
Than either of the pleas maintained by you .
He can not get the fancied one ;
Downs ' forefalls beat to the burial .
Which al this world hath set unevene
No bird-song floated down the hill
About them lay , outwafting strange perfumes .
And that thought took shape as i
Shedding their influences as they pass ;
As little as the moon stops for the baying
Thy mother bore her longing and her pain ,
Then through the quiet church there ran
Of eyes that , when by anger stirred ,
Passed the day in sullen rage ,
After that hard betrayal made me
Their plumes driven backward by the wind they made
His weapon made him way with bloody war :
The tears of my heart 's pity render
Found these songs so wild and wayward ,
My life can be no longer borne ,
May with the spirit 's wings hold equal motion .
Roll europe over england . they 've not grasped
Will level a rebellious spear .
He heard the brook , and straightway took
The strokes falle upon the smale ,
Who loves , no law can ever bind ;
For clytié mourn , and take heed
And flame-tongues licked along the clay .
Still humming on , their drowsy course they keep ,
And jack went supperless to sleep ;
Since my appeal says i did strive to prove
Life had grown burthensome ,
Have circled . if the power of sinning more
Determining how fast or far we go ;
Drawing cheerful music from them .
He said -- " the season is almost run ;
Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity ,
Ere that fate makes an attack upon thy head
And here , before the sun withdraws his light ,
To wound the bards of ancient time ,
It tried to be a rose
I follow a famous father ,
The hour is come . gather the host together
Man 's stubborn heart , as i have felt ,
Take note , ye prudent and pious souls ,
Caspar , whose wealth was counted
Which made their ankles wriggle with such throes
This flame without more flickering would stand still ;
Not knowing what to feel or if i understand
Glory endures when calumny hath fled ;
This fact must strike the intellect of man , --
His sway ; hate unto christians has he vowed ,
Take the stern strength that nature gives the few !
His former acts secure his present fame ,
The cold gray east was warming into rose
And , gathering all their life into his hand ,
To think good fortune had quite turned my brain .
First for food it ground a chestful ,
And gentle faces welcomed him .
( the greatest blessings life can show , )
" where wave over wave the rapt music went streaming
Whiles clouds around the west take marble tones ;
And the dish ran away with the spoon .
It fills them full of song .
The eagles floated , struggling with the wind .
Goodliest in troy fell hector ; back to greek
Follow your saint , follow with accents sweet !
That gathers behind thee throws forth
Thy weak wings folded and thy music hushed .
The summer webs that float and shine ,
Has drowned the hopes that fortune held in fee --
Let christ give grace to his arms .
The offered hawk gives tokens which oft deceive .
Yet i another 's appetite may whet ;
The summer breeze now sighed among the flowers
A lover would not tread
Set on warm lips imperishable kisses .
The happy sigh of faintly stirring night
His dearest lowered into endless night .
And the golden moon stayed listening ,
By which the life to its height is brought .
Shall they return to beatings of great bells
Whome'er thy lovely haunts engage .
Till it was lost amid the clouds of heaven :
The great tears sprang to their meeting eyes ;
They thought the tide of grief would flow
Had voice when lowered heavens drummed for gales .
Of two physicians could not stem the tide .
Which with that voice come back to me , --
And fortune , that like youthful plant will shoot ,
Then my heart is filled with sorrow ;
They smiled at each other . their leader broke
As coming from thy power and from thy goodness
Winters chilled the summers ' ardor .
Had paled it to the hue it wears ,
He had been weaving lovely dreams of song ,
Of loyal valour betrayed by factious hate ,
And cities build and wield the latin sway ,
And the pilgrim on her way hath gone .
Which thither death , and desolation brought ,
And its presence adds to the rhyme of love
While the bacon and liver went merrily round .
Let bloom-dust of my life be blown
Gaunt and dreary ran the mountains ,
And the chiefs made answer saying :
We shot beneath the cottage with the stream .
Then sung the bard how the light vapours rise
In hot diseases , argues death ;
What a father 's love prepares ,
The fire , the fire , it stirs .
The track called land .
They feel that all is well .
Perchance to show his lore designed ;
And freedom , such as genuine patriots fired .
We sup on pleasures long gone by --
Only my soul kept watch from day to day ,
Certain facts which serve to explain
Yet him she saw lament , as if his pain
To join the dance with glee ;
Rome built for manhood rotted by her thrall .
Their hearts have not grown old ;
Let all the earth with scorn recount my case ;
A silly old stanza of it runs thus --
" give me my old life of freedom ,
Through all his bosom feels the fierce desire ;
With solemn step an awful goddess came ,
Heaven 's anthem blending with the shriek of hell !
Of blossoms clomb the skies of june .
More noble than in me are found :
The quality of mercy is not strained ,
Then first her anger , leaving pelleas , burned
Ambition first sprung from your bless 'd abodes ;
Shame never made girl redder than gareth joy .
My heart is warm with the friends i make ,
Which secrets , hid for many ages , taught .
But with my numbers mix my sighs :
That stills the middle of each rural morn --
That e'er hath stood in budding wood
This thing , i pray , with truth explain :
The stones of rome to rise and mutiny .
While their deep joy the valley fills , --
Since by more strong anxiety assailed ,
Thus heaven can make it known , and true
Wilder , again a sad song she intoned :
It was because a woful dread possessed .
A valiant wind the vanguard leads ;
Have soothed or burned in manhood 's breast ,
That low in death her husband lies . ”
Of the last hope that drew
The artist wrought this loved guitar ;
At length , exhausted with the wearing strife ,
For i am filled with perfect joy from it .
And absolutely rolled in dollars .
But yesterday ordained , and wrought to-day .
Nor whither her ashes before the wind flew .
But could not rest for musing how to smoothe
Each bridge that he makes either buckles or breaks ,
Goes to high bliss that never ends ,
Turning my torment into music for them .
The aching brow must lower .
That came so near to being his ?
Where liberty has lodged an hour
For naught that sets one heart at ease ,
I the common sense can show ,
And shaking this too upish generation ,
Each with his gaze turned inward on some piece
And every tree that wears for her
Took his father 's sword of magic ,
With that fair wreath my brows to bind ,
The bay stirred and murmured and parted its lips
To seal a covenant of love .
Sounds but this once again . put by regret
The connection of which with the plot one sees .
That bears a human soul !
That portion of his thoughts , which should have led
And a good south wind sprung up behind ;
Fills the streets with gloom ,
But from such rivalry it takes a soil .
You 'll dwell with me when time extinguish breath .
Many a lie has filled its maw !
And italus , that led the colony ;
And sent you following the white waves of sea ,
Going for honey overturns the hive ,
How did those prospects give my soul delight ,
Thy rays reach farther than the gulfs ;
And june its roses ; showers and sunshine bring ,
Where day may bring forth fruits of joy to day
Was richer far than fifty years to come .
The powers of nature in me , lest they run
I hai n't got no time to tarry .
Through thickest shades pursues the fond of peace .
And love as hate : and none draws near
The glorious gifts -- the kingly mind she saw ,
They are but set to rise again .
To add new splendour to the rite :
Of steel and iron arose the clang ,
It is when soul meets soul , and they embrace
No wage , or labour stained with the disgrace
Where church-way mounts to moaning hill ,
New forms arise , while other forms decay ,
When once true lovers take their last farewell .
Cast thy trinkets to the children ,
Of nice words fairly fitted forming on , --
To whom ulysses made this wise reply :
And he spake the words that follow :
Upon us : surely rest is meet .
Bindweed that runs ;
Years have lightly come and gone
Of anguished love , long hidden , speak
And all things save sheer right are vain enough .
There goes my dinner bell ! i hear it saying
The morn hath risen clear and calm
Darkness of woods where scents were blowing
Save when your own imperious branches swinging ,
What though there comes a time of pain
Fill thee to see our time ;
No difference sees from one style to another ; "
But kept the vows that held him bound :
For there the just and good shall meet ,
Ships the angry sea is lashing ;
The antique prow goes on its way , dividing
And from the house goes every one content .
Break even the impregnable wall of memory
But merlin gave his soul to see
For which came such a woe to diomed
But time which none can bind ,
Should war 's mad blast again be blown ,
Down in a flowery meadow sat they right merrily .
The dew shines bright ; i bide forlorn ,
As their silver glanced on her locks of gold ;
A fluttering whiteness , came our ilsabe --
So i again resorted to the lore
Such utter sweetness filled the aerial plain .
What words can drown that bitter cry ?
And set it to soft orient measure .
My perspective still as they pass :
No blemish on the sense of beauty broke ,
Fever and fear distract the world ,
With their caps of darkness hooded !
It flashed from the crown that she wore ,
For , him who from destruction drew
And not a rent made by the gale !
But , now , there fell a shade of gloom
Her cheeks turned to a poppy 's hue .
And stars beyond thy towers bring tidings of .
We bore the heat and danger of the day :
Flame of the candle attracts with its guttering ,
Creation 's blended stores arranging as she flies .
By malison of theirs is not so lost
There lapped in sleep each wearied queen ,
And the dusk scatters before the prows ,
The year still longs awhile to stay .
In vain sedate reflections we would make ,
Has a secret tale to guard and hold ,
In many parts , nor thrown away a stroke .
To vassalage and loathsome service bound .
That so with rapture takes my soul ;
April 's anger is swift to fall ,
But make the best exchange of life for praise .
" what has brought you here , o hero ,
For he knows sewers run beneath the city streets .
It calls -- what needs he more ?
Which from those hands angelical ascended ,
By one mighty impulse led --
And never a saint took pity on
It comes through objects leaving them unharmed ,
Too far away to make their fury heard !
Death or distance soon consumes them : wind
Of attaining and gaining the popular praise ;
It serves him for a peaceful monument ,
Nor blasted were their wedded days with strife ;
Plainer what tears are now showing too well .
And long the stars their nightly vigils kept ,
In them moved sombre figures sable-clad ;
For what to one had given the power to take
A cooling wind crept from the land of snows ,
And _ feel _ my immortality !
I will show no anger needless .
And blow the gay pantechnicon all night .
Firm hand that loftier office took ,
Rich industry sits smiling on the plains ,
His sample followed , and his brethren twain ,
The water dwells a multitude , whose sighs
Shall strengthen while the years go by :
Her brightest hopes are fled away ,
While fancy 's eye still sees the scenes
And life lived out at sea where men exist
Stepping where those dear feet had left their trace .
And the fresh drink fell to cursing ,
Beneath the rising tempest . heard ye not
For meat , shall give thee melody .
How -- as if the sunshine drew
From my lips the tones are gliding ,
The way the spring comes to our town is such
To light her faded fire ,
The myrtle flowers stretch themselves in the sunshine ,
That a brook makes in such a wild descent .
The glad , sweet spirit that has taken wing --
As still he mourned with burning sighs
But you 're sad and filled with gloom ,
The place he found beyond expression bright ,
That i these woods my home would make ?
Here in full light the russet plains extend :
Which known , the steel can work no harm ,
These his lance reaches ; over those he rolls
When darkness brings its weeping glories out ,
And when the winter threatens there ,
Had followed ! such a triumph had he lost
And gather sinners to the knees of grace .
Wait only till i fetch my horse , that stands
The mist hangs over the passes ,
Or , far removed from light of day ,
The lightning making rapiers of the rain ;
Poured in too copious , filled the empty veins
And gonoessa ’s spires salute the sky .
The wound i suffer , never find a cure .
I heard what made my heart to dance ,
The welcome given young and old .
The beauty we said would never perish . --
To him , who strikes the chord ,
The wintry mist , then lost to view :
The rapturous sight would fill
Swift to convey the tidings glad :
Indulgence claimed , since winthrop no more sinned ,
To glory give the space thou hast to stay ;
Such blow no other hand could deal
No scattered foe to face , but lucifer .
And the proud waves , unbidden , lifted her .
And kept it till the fall .
Let sweetly the tones go twining
To level with the dust their antique hall ,
And courage to the tribe that calls him chief .
Is to give them no surrender .
His crumbling dust with which the breezes play ,
For the autumn must come with its mournful story ,
So many a heavy thought he chased away
In pangs , and nature gave a second groan ,
I drop my heart , unshriven !
Or tames the genius of the stubborn plain ,
And it flashes up the slope and sits in splendor
But , oh ! the rain that gave it life
She has no house to lay a guest in --
Of such a hero , and to bear his dust
The crackling salt , that makes the altar shine ,
And her name is a name held sacred
The trooping clouds in heaven 's spaces dim .
In thee its changing tints are seen ;
And left the rest to god .
Still sent its glittering stream forth into air ,
Why comes temptation but for man to meet
With whatso body has shed it fluttering forth --
When it enters the eve of years .
Cleansed and made strong by the tears
The little _ revenge _ rushed down their broken line
Oh what kisses kissed by thought ,
That sent the simple heart a-fooling ;
Again by death , although sad watch he keep ;
That have made men utter the words of angels ,
But newly eased of their nausceous pain ,
Though through these waves it lay .
But war comes . there was peace too long .
Forth to the forest went .
She opens her heart to the kisses of night .
I feel the conqueror in my blood and race ;
Knowledge we sought and gathered wisdom rare .
And echoing shouts confess the joyful rage .
Her heart 's reserve , brought out to show
( the courier added ) and the cause declared :
Thou love that guards the nestling 's faltering flight !
Another couplet originally followed here :
Pity this bosom stricken with dismay !
The day of grief must come at last .
The frequent use of these gives rise to scenes
She goes to burning and dishonour
Of riches , hast our town explored ;
How strength may serve for purity is shown
And their sweet lips hold the same perfume .
Moving like dreams through happiness ,
And sweet long lips with tears and kisses fed .
The leaves are stirring : let us watch awhile .
The night ensuing took them as they lay
I followed in his train against that law 's
To the elements it came from
A bank of mud around me lay ,
He sold for cash and gave no tick tick --
They raise a weak and melancholy wail ,
Those hours the ancient timepiece told , --
No sigh they drew , no breath they heaved ,
Burns with one love , with one resentment glows ;
Which poised in air the bird no longer keep :
The summer leaves the hill ;
The tumult and the shouting dies --
How soon my lucy 's race was run !
My summons came across the endless spaces ?
Happy happy time , when the white star hovers
Even i a wiser path could show .
The interest held with hardly a lag
Like an ocean flying before the wind ,
Which nature holds for ever at her eye .
His heart knew peace , for none came here
But doth the glorious theme renew .
Then off there flung in smiling joy ,
I would mine heart had caught that wound
Then come misfortune , i bid thee welcome ,
Shadows , like the violets tangled ,
Which held to juno in a cheerful way ,
Murmurs arise and bursts of laughter .
Of purest praise spontaneously has welled
But lay the blame on melville g. !
She brings in much by carnal usury .
Which makes me sick at heart to know ,
Perhaps it was the puzzle whose solution clearly showed
To see who breaks my rest . "
New files succeed to those who fall in fight ,
Which safely leads to a successful end ,
Ion , the delphic priest , who lays aside
It will live in the heart of the nation ,
United hearts have made united states !
Did not an evil spirit come on saul ?
Received , as meet , the lady ’s care .
The sun spilt out his gold ;
The spring is come , or if it stay
And strength and pleasure beamed upon his brow .
And in one great sheaf i bore them along .
Grey morning came , and at the break of
A thousand years hath it borne that name ,
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn ;
And to himself for refuge flies !
But the fire flashed up most fiercely ,
The jointed shields , and lays the warriors low .
Even so , those streets and houses do but show
What booty they must keep and what let go ,
Giving as much of ardour as it finds .
She found adventure there , excitement too .
The winds at night had made a rout ,
The spirit sinks in grief and sadness low ,
And made the holy sign ,
He bore arms for his country . and he heard
And in words like these expressed him :
And makes his only prayer for peace ,
His guards lay dormant ; so her magic words ,
I dreamt someone said that the bay would have made
To drip a horror at impassive feet
With unaverted gaze to find the light divine .
Each face pervaded . earth her natives bore ,
That then a gale did quickly bring
With music raised , they spread abroad their hair ,
Big with the flames that to our ruin rose .
Yet spring came again with its green and blue ,
With their dilated nostrils spread ,
But what he took a glance ,
The flying tidings whirled .
Of conquest ; where ispahan gave touch ,
His load of grief could hardly bear .
The throne they bestow where they love .
And rode revolving in his troubled thought
Slowly the low cloud swung , and far
Might stir my sleeper 's tranquil trance ,
( the news had spread already through the land )
And turn to noon our night :
Tilt the power that shaped us , over us all
But , alas ! we came to grieving :
And the highest clouds it pierces ,
Words interwove with sighs found out their way .
His blazing aegis thrice apollo shook ;
When our lovely spring is leaving .
And the scenes that fancy raises
Then came a warm , still day of may
And the moon stands still and listens
To purify and glad the world .
To lean upon a heart that 's thine !
The sweetest bells that ever pealed ,
Against god 's pleasure , than that fruit which makes
The voices known as " beautiful " come near
The darkness gathered deeper ,
The snow must have made
Confound their slanders and detect their lies .
It mingled strangely with my fears ,
To the base court the females take their way ;
Earth trembled at it and the heaven was opened .
Poor edward showed his grief ;
And trembling ague in each member lies :
The year waxed fervid , and the sun
Which travels nature , flies from star to star ,
Her fourth , to rally him into repentance ;
To lead sweet lives in purest chastity ,
The current which ran northward with thy boat ,
While somewhat of uneasiness still palpitates ,
And spread through all the worlds his name .
And defend all that women can earnestly feel .
The black waves moaned and broke unutterably
Such as no mortal shoulders ever bore .
' t is sweet to know that stocks will stand
That slides down gently from his flaggy wings ,
But other answer made he none ,
Such sound as makes the saints in heaven rejoice ;
While some were made to take a crowd
How sorrow near it could not dwell ,
Some stealthy hand thy death wound gave .
Shall we lose courage now ? never !
Caught in a perfume from the crowds that pass ,
Died -- and took the finest grave .
The stone hath yielded to thy sturdy blow : --
But the dolefu ' bugle brings
Breathes its music , sheds its light
An easier prey to foes . thou hast given joy
They flashed upon us love 's bright gem ;
And harmless lightnings leapt from cloud to cloud .
They never could have screw 'd the secret out .
Both of the courts of heaven made manifest .
Were hers . here sat she careless how the skies
A thing so frail is thus pursued ?
For the fire ever burning in my heart
The dates which made me will be all forgotten ;
Orange and green will carry the day .
Melted all hope out of being ,
Delicious licence called it nature 's cry ;
As a confession made from soul to soul .
And drown my joy in care ,
How weary his relations grow
To light us to freedom and glory again !
That these things come to pass as i record ,
Superfluous matter came , shot out in ears
This lesson more frequently brought to our view
So the wild wind strews its perfumed caresses :
Yet still the sunbeams shine through all
Content with love and happiness should dwell .
Strain every nerve , and bid the vessel fly .
Discoursing still of beatrice went on ,
To beggarly vile appetites descend ;
The country open lay without defence :
The sacrament prepared as we have willed ;
Of spears : anon fair painted crests arose ,
Light is the burden luve lays on ;
To learn how love can spring from hate --
Winter kept us warm , covering
So many deeds , so many thoughts to weigh ,
Long centuries have come and gone .
Comes the true goddess , by her blushes known --
Now it no longer steals over my walls --
Tramp , tramp across the land they speede ,
The bowneck mob all run stone-blind .
News from the humming city comes to it
They willed to prepare this world 's magnificence ,
The master with his eye is following so . "
Could i submit to make thy word my law ;
" keep thine own counsel , and confess
But in old age it came to pass
And , flying , upward he his breast directed ;
A something born of mournful dreams
Flooding the night , no hope can wipe away !
Lost in the chaos of consuming war . "
' the young widow sends thee friendly greeting ;
Make thou dead faith and love to rise again .
To bid wild passion 's fiery flush depart ;
Through the fields her clear notes rang :
Full of discord shrill which echoed
To guard and keep the one true faith
His reverence for the grace bestowed ;
Doomed in his hand a skull to bear ,
And softly went that neither tired was ,
My love is just coming to me
Oft raise the thundrous cheer ,
Till chance had there voiced me
While resting from the toils of war ,
The leaves drop from our rose of dawn ,
And make the winter days abide ?
This makes you feel very lonely .
My heart all winter lay so numb ,
He said . ilioneus made this reply :
Or decently in death my limbs compose .
While the sign of battle flew
Down there do the dear little violets lie ;
Will take advice from one who 's wiser ,
Destruction-ward , and lit her path to death
And death that holds the tiller as we ride .
These few short years make wondrous alterations ,
But the high charity , that makes us servants
And another stanza runs thus : --
Sad as the last which reddens over one
And there the pyramid of balls is reared to tell
We both to service went from sports and play ,
And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall
For this he shares a felon 's cell ,
Crime begets crimes the heavens to appall .
The moon put forth a little diamond peak ,
On willy 's birthday , as you see ,
Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes .
Nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls .
There came into my ear a voice
And much his kindness told upon her gentle heart ;
So gaining courage , did he raise his face
For the ocean waves were rolling
Ten days passed before i again saw the major .
" what are these crystal globes by nations shed ?
Frae town to town i draw that .
Unless i give my life for thee .
To ease him of his misery .
I 'll make you happy if i can ;
As it declared , and not for crime committed ,
But that is but a tent wherein may rest
For them to form some exquisite repast ?
Is void ) , the same hath made my cemetery
Whenever chance and strength shall favor . be our shores
Which lends each street romance and mystery --
There three days long devoured his grief ,
The silent harvest of the future grow ,
And later times saw deeds as brave ;
You speak of worlds with rainbow prospects vaulted .
Which give fallacious matter to our doubts ,
Advanced , and made a constellation there !
That veils the future , -- in its wasting course
O'er all alike the impartial sunset throws
And cut the branch ; to save the shock
To give at last the weary world surcease
Such counsel , such deliberate care they take ,
Her eyes turned upward and her brow
A land breeze shook the shrouds ,
To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long .
Winona came the last , but as she stept
The troubled torrent fills ,
And the waving corn-tops seem to dance
But kept the vows that held him bound :
As king , the first blow belongs to thee ,
Until we met the solid town ,
And on thy happy temples safely set
Although we knew no laugh lay there .
May make thy fond desire a sport and play ,
Warning the gods that foes draw nigh to heaven ;
The six philosophies expound it ,
Where i had sunk in black despair .
Break the treaties you made with louis bourbon ;
No further happiness i now could find :
Bring me favor , mountain-woodlands ,
Sleep came then o'er me -- and i seemed
As the waves wear smooth the shore-stone ?
Follow 'd the sad procession in despair .
Was as a mighty symphony unfurled ;
_ toll _ , the music reeled and pealed
Your feeble hand , was keeping them from ill ?
Take heed ; the walls have ears !
“ my penance meed this day i see
And , tho ' her lips no motion made ,
When cares that come oppress and burden me ,
I reach my heart out toward the springtime lands ,
She finds marphisa , with such fierce disdain
The watchful angel set for truth 's defence ;
There came a burst of thunder sound :
Was meant to make the earth more green ,
Our future fame will glisten forth
Or as the past on memory 's tablet rose ,
Whose graves eat souls and all .
On downy pillows find a sweet repose !
As they read this empty rhetoric .
Yet lay the weight so close about
That the ugliness grows beauty .
A throne sent word to a throne :
And from her mast no battle-message burned .
Of broad estate , won from posterity ;
The following specimens illustrate various forms of stanzas
And for all this , nature is never spent ;
That his artist-mother fashioned ;
Can give us either pain or pleasure , who
Lest police inspector drew should challenge .
The soil which lay for many thousand years
Modesty bows her head , and that young heart
But time which none can bind ,
My heart can lie in ruin 's dust ,
And first to light exposed the sacred shade .
But my voice returned on the moaning blast ,
While the summers go by .
Now evening closed , and cast a silent gloom ;
The pit-black clouds hung o'er them .
Ripe were the maiden 's years ; her stature showed
Music that bids the spirit sing
Yet ere that day was spent i knew
The populace , and spread a wide alarm ?
Forced into virtue thus by self-defence ,
That glimmers and is gone . they shall behold
For scripture lore his promise claimed ,
But hope impels , and love commands ,
The membrane-valve sustains the weight above ;
Farther and farther yet the light is spread :
Now my honour is turned into decline ! "
The shifting lights of land and distant sea ?
And though it in the centre sit ,
But when she awoke she found it a joke ,
Each day to the king the reports came in
Whose faithful footsteps follow still
Though we seek life through , we shall surely find
Filled the evening star with splendor ,
That sobbing utterance could form ,
Despair had stamped his iron seal ; her cheek
Would make our hearts rejoice .
And the cock felt exceedingly queer ;
Made the huge anchored ships dance merrily ,
Full many a year this bird has spent .
Fearing advance , yet venturing again .
The poet 's bays and critic 's ivy grow :
There underneath , not made by torments sad ,
What kind of goods a ready sale would gain .
As closely followed by my bleating flock ,
Within the tent , a flare gave blowing light .
More lightly now it beats , and welcomes back
Through the thought still spread beyond her :
That heart that lo'ed me dearly !
Flashed from whose plane the sun-sparks fly ,
And adds perfumes unto the wine , which thou
Which brought him from his throne above
Which should have kept its place in memory 's urn
Which never could fail
Down to the gloom i took my pensive way ,
Where alph , the sacred river , ran ,
Within them was the twofold monster shining ,
Destruction with creation might have mixed .
Who gave thee right , o brother !
Ah ! when winter winds are swinging
" to soothe the throbbing passions into peace . "
His little eyes lie cold and still ; --
Nor passionate prayer , nor longing hope restore .
Magnolias light the glooms .
While the sign of battle flew
Their healthful slumbers never broke by care .
Though leagued against me hundred heroes stand .
They reach to where alaska strikes the sea ,
Or can such friendship fail to move
Ye would not stay your dew time to expect ,
Took up arms to save the union ,
How could i crowd my dungeons dark and low
When fevers burn , or argues freezes ,
That broods till love 's exquisite truth ,
Short — though i have seen three centuries over —
Lest they kick ye a fearsome jolt .
And in thine ears the olden music rang ,
And make it stand indeed the will of heaven .
And the mist through the valley has rolled ,
Mecon the eastern nile , whose swelling waves ,
They would indeed work miracles in art ,
For in the prime , thy influence was felt ;
Sent its strange anguish from the rent profound :
And cut the network of the cloak
Or , when the weight of proof is told ,
A female form i see ;
The woman i behold , whose vision seek
The reason of my fear will tell .
These sounds i 'll strive to catch ;
In hours of bliss we oft have met ,
But they 'll disperse when you a convert see .
Her city home is matched of none ! "
No storms , nor clouds , can rise .
And soon will evening shut :
Take the good the gods provide thee !
And trembling struck , and rooted in the field ;
And to new ones gives birth .
A sect whose chief devotion lies
Can ease the hardships of the labouring poor :
So far she spake by rage impelled ,
Something to keep for a charm in my heart --
Till my poor life be spent .
About him closed the gloom ;
Our loyal hearts send greeting to thee now ;
Fierce anger filled his soul with flame :
Divinely human , raising worship so
The red rose is revived at last ;
Find that time hath no need of me ,
To hide deceit , and give the harmless show
Which tremble made the pagan knights and lords .
Which makes you curse the vermin in the old bark
Saw god made manifest in lambent flame .
That can lead hell 's phantom-throng .
And step for step they followed dancing ,
The vánar legions reached the main ,
Except the peace that death rode forth to win .
As the moments roll on .
Youth and joy ; so jove hath sworn .
The fool his public lamentation sings . "
Forth spouting streams of blood and smoke ,
Yet on her finger had she set the ring
For from one sod an ample growth it rears ,
So well content to look upon her daughter ,
Is god 's house on a blowing day .
To god ’s high throne such haste she made ;
And their brave eyes shining bright ,
No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale ,
Of some great woe which wraps his soul around .
Has made you like unto the little child ,
While all the jealous devils made him wild ;
Where most women lose every vestige of grace
Persuaded that the hero comes no more .
But went on laughing , as before ,
Convey ’d that freshness the cool seas exhale ;
That heart that lo'ed me dearly !
The forfeit ? chamberlains , this message take
Oh , come now , peace !
My sight , that followed her as long a time
That follows after prayer .
And hope will have gone with pain ;
And make at least a happy home .
While inquiries among them , went rapidly round ,
With woe , when he the accusation hears :
Now to the roman standards are they come ,
He is given new life , and lives again
The line he took from the eyes of sid
To look at the new number just laid down ,
The peaceful olive in their hands to bear ,
When the bee-hive casts its swarm ;
To drive the cold winter away .
But still the hope experience taught to live ,
That went to help the sea .
Than light may read , or wisdom may control .
Christianity , when the great war came .
Than reclaimed lovers take
By this the wind more fiercely rose ,
Frae wrist to wrist this band we pass ,
The doctor put him in the dark of ether .
The strong clouds set themselves like ice ,
Come forth to victory : burst the ancient bounds
But each gave cheer in the other 's ear ,
With horrid strides ; hell trembled as he strode .
Their force is pressed out , and therefore flies
With sweetest words the sage addressed :
Tend the sequestered altar of romance ,
Where the groundnut trails its vine ,
To spread about the itch of verse and praise ;
Pompless no life can pass away ;
That trails all over it , and to the twigs
Never through martyrdom of fire was led
That is each round shows more divinity ,
How nicely are his changes planned ,
Of the near pool ; and how the shadow lies
Seems to make reply --
This earth for perfection to seek .
Around the lady 's form rare beauty threw .
And many of them that have took ' t
That which to god alone of right belongs ?
With fog , and made the heaven above intent ,
And swept the piteous round of mortal woes ?
They never raise the war-whoop here ,
In love like thine be wrought ,
Take the thanks of a boy .
Hope that all nature underlies .
Whose goods have won them wide renown ;
And lonely age is yours , whose tears have fallen
And the old faith lives again .
Which , with a fearful fascination drew
And , not so white , when summer lifts
Who can bestow the boon which i can give .
Until the last , most distant answer sighed :
And feel the passion of infinities
All day the floods a deepening murmur pour ;
The faithful lakshmaṇ , thus addressed
Till christ at the end relieve our guard .
No second blow need follow ; to the king
Chloris is gone , the cruel fair ;
And like a dream the girlish days drift past .
Whene’er he roared his voice of fear
( a sight life 's sorrows to repulse ,
Our pity shall be given ,
Which seeks a presence , from the distance brought ,
No friend the parting hand extended gave ,
And no wonder his life should be threatened .
Now draw the plugs and drink your fill !
And bloodshed stained the sheaves of life .
And unto each the promise came ,
And frost and silence turn the keys
And the snake , his green coils lowered ,
And to my words attention lend . ”
Or it might be my veins ran cold --
There for remembrance fondly stored ,
And none so timid but finds her fate ;
And flowing from his ill designs , it fell
He made his hourly moan ,
On the bosom of nature like diamonds descend .
She stands a creature pure and glad ; serene ,
It answered : ' thee as in my mortal frame
Julia 's breast can give you them :
My muse employ that word so dear ;
Their stillness answering his cry ,
Improve your privileges while they stay ,
Whose every breath comes fresh from flowers ,
Required to rise triumphant from defeat ;
Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides ,
And harmless on the earth it lay .
Still the learned volumes lay ,
Her face had filled his careless eye
Of fire proclaims me thine and bans the pale
Beneath the tall grey trees resting at noon
Who knows where one week more may carry us ?
Sweetly they sang , and still the answer came
What made him leave his task unwrought ?
And made old nick remember it
And see how much they 'd be .
Nor in the fond embrace , embraces give :
Whence tyber first unlocks his mighty flood . "
While the stars send down a light
To top a ball around the ladies ' course !
Long centuries had come and gone
Worth being poor to hold in fee .
That calumny itself left clean and fair .
The lion thus , with dreadful anguish stung ,
Do here find rest .
That fell like sunshine where it went ,
And leave me helpless and forlorn .
The palm and may make country houses gay ,
Sparkling , flashing in the sunshine ;
Not fancifully drawn , that one might weep ,
Still making religion their author and cloak ,
New fabrics raised , on new design ,
And through our hearts swept ghostly pain
When midnight came to close the year ,
Of flame , by vents the fireshine drove
Or would they go on aching still
" surely this creature sprang from paradise , "
So lead me from paths that are ugly ,
And mend the blunders pride or folly makes ?
It made the very heart within me dance ,
Her eyes rejected the sunset ,
This healing wrought ; a greater power divine ,
Where purgatory its true beginning takes . "
There came into many a burgher 's pate
Mind can not follow it , nor words express
Sadness he solaced ,
I tried another girl , it would n't work .
Through all the moods that pass ;
And the wide land reaches beyond our eyes ,
And healthy , hot desires too swift to turn ;
It winds around the form we woo --
Night came on , she the bridegroom seized ,
Whose life is mixed with rose lorraine .
The song of liberty in her hearing spoke
Her own heart feels the throb that never dies !
The star that led them all the way
Rejoicing in the gift that god has given ,
A miracle like that could see
And the wretched council 's bosoms beat ,
The conflict knew no pause or stay .
Until a halt was made at last
That thinks to scale the bastioned slopes
A manly form usurped thy place ,
A virgin-life not only led ,
Thus folly with ambition join 'd ,
And a great minster 's glory met our sight .
The twilight comes with thy shadowy feet .
Hence comes the lofty port , the haughty air ,
Like the dwarfs of times gone by ,
It ended , and the morrow brought the task .
That love which formed its treasure here ,
Which i set forth in sorrow for my child .
The flower has come for the honey bee :
Gray , heavy clouds muffled the valleys ,
I had laid on the chestnut 's mane .
This turn hath made amends ; thou hast fulfill 'd
Their light in equal distribution pour 'd .
With silvery sides bedropt with gold ,
While leaving the last kiss on some dear cheek ,
Love makes those young whom age doth chill ,
This said aletes : and a murmur rose
Where cruel slavery never sought to rein --
Blood drawn by these out of their faces sprung
What numbers do the soul compose ;
Childhood vanished , youth departed ,
A time may come our race may rise ,
By secret tears which filtered through as lye .
And put a period to your gladsome days ,
Furies my guilty conscience that torment ,
Love shall come though long he tarry .
And to swell the fighting faction
His hands and voice together lifts in prayer :
Of dreadful silence . nought it serves --
And blamelessly resume the game .
Thus perforce they make a stand-still ,
The law can still oppress the weak ,
Those who return have pressed alone the coast ;
He counts it as no sin
Than the heart of man can contain .
I can but own my weakness , and deplore
Grand as we were when treading royal ways .
Rage prompted them at length , & found them arms
And the glad winds blew .
This is my bethel ; here i feel again
Flashing his baleful eyes .
And from her eyes the torrents came
Here sweet buds showed their tints of blue :
With lighter probe or deep , touching the faith ,
The moons that make bright pathways on the sea ,
O'er cambridge set the yeomen 's mark :
In vain their story we recall ,
Who feels his currents ever slowlier run ,
And will not on me , pity take .
Come and turn away this evil ,
( the pilot made reply )
Mary started , and a new terror seized her .
By what his glowing passions can engage ;
And look the love that shall remain --
That through the middle of the city ran .
Which she keeps for a sign
To see what comfort it would yield ;
This each one felt and found
And cast the dark foundations deep ,
He felt sound logic proved he should be roasted .
Of noblest women , stood the king ,
That well they showed desire for their dead bodies ;
The pride of war his breast inspired .
Like a shuttle deftly skipping through the
Adds joy to duty , makes me glad to pay
A host that breaks where foe is none , --
And whilst the front of the french vanguard makes ,
Only the mightier movement sounds and passes ;
Their flag to april 's breeze unfurled ,
When life struck hands with love ?
An could maintain a lady free . "
Let us echo the blessing that fell
So may my lady 's prayers prevail ,
The loveliest form she e'er gave birth .
To make them look so gay ?
The disk of my new planet gliding there
Away and took such ' vantage in his flight ,
Making a blessing of the ban ;
And where the tears they made to flow ?
And colours dipped in heav ' n ;
To ' fend with fist and poker took firm
I heard men saying , leave hope and praying ,
For who christ 's eyes shall miss , with those
The solid forest gives fluid utterances ,
Valleys hear ; all our longing eyes are turned
The time will come when you 'll be sad ,
And passing years afresh reveal --
His high-class manners do n't count for much
I have made the arm of the driver fail ,
A rose 's when it lay
There lay her fragrant presence to beguile
His blushing bride the quiver 'd hero leads ;
And gory sabres rise and fall
And those will bear some keeping still about . "
And brilliant equipage , that flashed and spun ,
This throng of faces turned to meet my own ,
Full upon the crown it struck him ,
That leads his creatures in the heavenly way ,
Would raise so terrible a wail
Before the wind of joy that speeds the suns .
Tearing my heart in sick torture ,
Carries within his heart a little hell ,
And thence the slumbering music bring .
White petals on the pathway slept .
With speed their upward way they take ,
Yet , touched and softened nevertheless
But dusk would come in the apple boughs ,
Lest knaves know our hearts are met ,
Then , vile squats blast the eerie air !
She goes on smiling .
Turns no vain glance towards fading heights of pride ,
Love never more could touch my wasteful heart
The papers pounded nerves with battle news ;
Snuffed blood , to summon homely peace ,
Thence to their images on earth it flows ,
Even the trees have let their glory pass ,
And quarrels are blown up upon that head ;
And make our god our all in all .
And forth the spirit issued , -- yet around
Alternately their shifting hands they plied .
A moisture gathers on each knop
The hours move swift and sure along ;
His escort , crying victory , swelled ,
Thou old red criminal , stand forth ; i charge
The darkness fell . then by a stygian draught
For such absorbing grief , she chides his heart
That holds you near it for a longer time
And weakness gives warning to yield .
The hands that cling and the feet that follow ,
Through half-lit halls which reach no end .
That stirred the cedar boughs with scented wings ,
And troubled manhood follow 'd baffled youth .
She smiles on , marking their source :
We thought when love at last should come ,
And leave thy winter unheeded and lone ; --
And burning for a rival , beats the air .
Wild caresses of passion that startled and shocked .
Hither thy glory , which no limits bound ,
Life 's hopes waste all to nothingness away
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
I took him not for love but fright ;
With liberty , her purpose bold and bound
Their deeds are read , they heave giant sighs ,
Enough , when death demands the brave , to pay
No love , whose self it represents .
And holding back hot tears , she gave reply
My love goes lightly , holding up
Winters that withered all the green
For when the weary night had worn away
" splendour eternal , piercing through these folds ,
It admits honest laughter , and needs honest tears .
Put not to proof with the old adversary ,
My youth was spent amidst the simple charms
Of a heart to be laid
Others round other ships maintain 'd the war ,
Where the lily leans o'er an amber stream
Their valor to prove , and their havoc to spread
That bore her love to an erring son --
With sunken eyes , burning like carbuncles ,
No earthly joy thy soul shall miss ,
The mellow autumn came , and with it came
" it makes my old heart to beat higher ,
Thus much is left of old simplicity !
Many legends and traditions cluster round this sacred spot ;
From the close crag prepares the rushing spring ;
The sheriffs keep the shire . "
Like flowing gold shines the sea .
He caroll 'd lays of love ;
What words not infrequently seek to conceal .
That comes to warm you with its ray ,
Give that greeting from me . "
Unknowing what it told .
Stars , set deep , yet inly burning ,
And pass 'd for arguments of good endurance .
So fast come thy prophecy ;
In lonely labour stands mine own , my sweet ,
The autumn passes , therewith evenings lengthen ;
With magic sponge can wipe away an hour
Intensely fixed upon these very hills ,
That waited on her birth : she gave to them
The piper wind goes playing
With gathering haze , for now it neared midday ;
And his soul takes the sun , and yearns
Can come to being thus at fixed time .
Whose voices make the emptiness of light
To blow a blast of shattering power ,
Like the love that had given him birth ?
Who shared the work with god .
She closed of silent tolerance .
Her little steps with little steps attending .
That spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray .
Such is the absorbing hate when warring nations meet !
For love no interval of ease allows .
A mortal mother mixing with a god .
The frigate poured a broadside !
The mighty bow the hero drew .
' neath whose wing lay written pages
If pleasure in the sea is found
As westward shadows cloak each lee ;
Give us a heart aflame with love ,
The heavenly joy that can not find the word ?
To reach some point of excellence in art .
No matter : we will say whatever comes .
No compass to direct that way --
And the nearer mountains catch the glow ,
Then evenly they fall apart , in threesome order slip
And see the fruits they bear
So that their dreams may come back :
Nor the fresh drink yet was working .
Then know they lie beyond the vow --
The fire leapt up with willing light
Let the counsel for the prisoners now proceed .
The weather shine or pour ,
It will enfold him in the air .
Each to the other stood related ,
Of martyrs made a purple path for spain
The valley lay beneath their feet ;
Ere the old year should find its iron close ,
Childhood and youth are met in her .
Of this vast universe to make the tour ;
" make this answer to the question :
So that it makes them greedy for revenge ,
It _ ought _ to fill in infinite space --
But soon i found that sorrow , worn
In grecian chains her captive race were cast ;
His famine should be filled , and blessed his maw
And that this night her soul shall dwell at ease
When joy shall carry every sacred load ,
With wondrous force the hill he threw :
Depart ! glad easter glows with gratitude --
" when from thence the fire departed ,
We stand about our banner while it stands
Our love glows the more for thy gloom ;
That poets , crowned for vanquishing ,
My weary soul could rest .
My baited hooks will come a-wooing .
Colours of animals serve to conceal them
To have made even cato guilty . who has strength
So long with bitter rage they pent me in ,
Nine days they fell ; confounded chaos roared ,
Repress their rage , by hellish fury bred ,
Could pour my secret heart of woes ,
When our intrigues they see ,
And with united force the foe pursue :
Where the wild song used to flow
Till heedless fate , unmoved by weakness , bring him
This , as wick , the holy will convey .
If plagues or earthquakes break not heaven 's design ,
" reform demanded by the nation ;
Torch-rays on the walls made bars ,
Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse .
The evening comes , the fields are still .
And idle lay , though soon to rise again .
Already freighted no more freight be placed .
Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower
She cast herself before him on her knees ,
The writing must be letters maim 'd , that speak
His changing love -- with stars above ,
The major , till the paper comes ,
Defeated , severed from his spouse ,
Of silken tissues , wrought by worm and man ,
When , spite of conscience , pleasure is pursued ,
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of may ,
While every breath of eve that chanced to blow ,
The grave said to the rose ,
Than wandering heart from wigwam fire . "
Which she herself put on .
The time i 've lost in wooing ,
No safety soothed the kind ,
Each ornament is bathed in light ,
That life thus gently glides away --
But will the promise given keep ?
Their hair along the mountains rolled and filled
The crucifix that came of nazareth .
He gazed anew at life safe from surprise !
To front the foe that follows up the plain :
The ruin which thyself had made .
Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore :
Of his rich throne to mount the lofty stage ,
The passing breath that holds thy passion 's sway .
Moves deeper in their hearts and settles darker .
As ever from a glad world came
It made her look so fair .
Gathering force from every effort ,
A proof of thy ingratitude remains .
All others , hold him for his courteous lore .
To help all their true work find .
And fluttering did his heart arise .
And fret not though dark clouds should spread
We bound about our irreligious brows ,
All madly dancing through the pleasant valley ,
And eat from the fruits which industry will yield ,
To italy came charles , and for amends
Tempt not the battle , nor provoke the doom !
The cup of joy goes gaily round ,
Spoke in words like those which follow :
Gave vent to yelps distressing ,
Or seen with least reproach ; and virtue , taught
There runs a lane for thirty miles
Set within a coral smile .
The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound :
The sceptre sword of saxon kings shall reach ,
The air upon his errand flew .
And so , before three suns had set ,
While the flung spray leaps in a diamond dew
The dark robe floating , the dejection worn
' is very justly placed amongst the best ;
Fills a child 's clear laughter .
And tears ran trickling from her aged eyes .
-- that only serves to make us grieve
Had it brought the bride of beauty .
The solemn pang , nor soothe the parting breath ,
Life throbs about me , yet i stand
They touch the shining hills of day ;
Are come back again , you see ;
Till the sun dropped from the heaven ,
Their pride to smooth success , and scoff
Around him rose the bare , discolored walls ,
He carries his griefs on a shoulder
The wheel of the torment of wives went round
For little miss brag she lays much stress
And words too weak our praises to convey .
Lone wandering , but not lost .
Would be sure to take cold in tears .
Then screaming , on the blast was borne away .
Will has wealth and wealth to spare .
“ thee will i follow ; on thy crooked ship
While the sands o ' life shall run .
The haughty powers have fixed their dwelling-place .
I bring my grief to thee ,
So they , but my courageous heart remain 'd
And soft apollo 's hand doth strike the strings ;
" to stalk upon this stage of evil deeds ,
That when time serves may bring things better forth .
A touch may lead us from sin apart --
That saw thine image all the night
A pillow formed where love might rest !
And the luck that comes too late .
Or never feel the rage , or never own ;
The boughs of those long larches , bending low
To mark the growing meaning in thine eyes ,
Some faith from youth 's traditions wrung ;
And piercing talons was the winged pest ;
Thence came the honeyed corner at his lips ,
And popped the soap upon my head ,
To where the avalanche its force had spent ,
The wind it blew great gales that night ,
Full upon the crown it struck him ,
Tsar was i while girlhood lasted ;
Never to lave its love in them again .
Shall glad your heart , shall give you hope ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
And sorrow take a purple diadem ,
" the day of the trial will come ,
Contented , in the falling gloom ,
Are grace and truth and beauty to be found ;
All hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day --
Which voyaging from troy the victors bore ,
Where trembling hearts and longing hands might meet .
His limbs are cast in beauty 's mould ,
Rested -- it passed away , and darker gloom
For no starry light was shed ,
A stormy battle fierce hath raged
That holds communion with the promised skies ,
Might tell a tale were better left untold .
Would not fade with the dull years away .
So took i in child-innocence ,
And he find no redemption -- nor the wing
Should suffer angry passions to arise ,
Where secrecy remains in bliss ,
To mix his tears with one who wept .
My lips employed in song the while
Of steel into the slot that holds the table .
Brought down from palestine , which says that life
No look of thine can change this smile ,
And broke the silence following the last appalling thud
A station at the desk to take .
Fill , fill with the rising tide of night ;
Not to wives are favors given . ' "
Still on and on my lonely soul must go
Deem me not faithless ; stern parental sway ,
As from the muse might challenge endless fame ,
And bliss coquetting flies the grasp :
And did not pass by strength of pain .
Was non of hem that made speche ,
And the disdainful soul went groaning to the dead .
The soul of her beauty and love lay bare ;
" unto diana such a gift he gave ,
The doctor a drowsy half-vigil kept ,
Whose throne shall shadow all the seas that flow ;
That comes through the pain and torture accurst
On sky-lark wings my moments fly ;
Past years would shine , like some bright sea ,
And flames reaching far for her glorious hair .
" call on the lord , while life remains ,
Those chosen workmen that for timber went .
Laid down their lives for glory
So rush they down to the eternal night .
Up comes the dark ; down goes the sun .
To me more pitiable still , who draw
She saw not -- yet her shame did make .
Our lamps of joy are wasted ,
Were added mouths that gaped , and eyes that asked
O'er their fair cheeks the glowing blushes rise ,
With shame and terror tremble all who love thee ,
And something makes them always sing
They 'll keep their stubborn highland spirit ;
On the hot heavy-headed flowers , and drew
And by that much had put the germans down .
Take care , o wisp of a moon ,
And lead a universal freedom on .
And every path is spread with leaves .
As many have found to their pain .
The night is fallen cold ;
All bare of undergrowth the high peaks rose :
He made things lively we infer
Which grew in paradise , the bait of eve
Of body and of mind . it comes to pass
Nor grander cause or chieftain e'er came forth .
Quick he snatched the fire of heaven
Thinking he might proceed to tell us more ,
Shakes some proud city on sicilian seas ;
Led me , wrapped in many moods ,
Bright and clear he added then the heavens ,
Man 's greatest strength is shown in standing still .
Salvation that the sails possess
Deeds go out on a sea of human life ,
Where the shrill brass return ’d a sharper sound :
His other hand takes dull gray sand
When summer scents are on the air distilled ,
Which all the blest immortals brought to pass
Our bosoms wields a wizard might ,
Some love is found .
We school our lips to make our hearts
The question is not put how far extends
Thy early smile has stayed my walk ;
Even the scars my small-pox left me !
Of my life 's warfare ever seek thy face ?
And cowering before me lies the balmy night ,
The more she seeks the day 's broad light .
The shadows of the night may hide the sky ,
The greater blessedness preserves the more .
O'er his rough cheeks the tears profusely spread :
Than of its middle made the light a centre ,
And that quick shadow , ever moving , fell
To where the trossach hills arise .
Whose smell came blowing in
And question mixed with prayers i made thereof ,
Doth lead its sweet waters along .
And love fell back in the garden -- dead --
Abode his hour or two and went his way .
But tinged with mortal for the mortal mind ,
So clean , no surgeon ever pieced it more .
Low the poor ship leaned on the tide :
Each art that reason owns and sense approves .
That comes from persia 's bleeding heart ,
Young red-head stretched himself to yawn
But led them to the castle under guard .
Of old the lord of life gave birth
In showers that fall and icy blasts that blow .
Rejecting credence whilst a doubt remains ,
The sails were set , and the oars kept tune
What wealth the show to me had brought .
Of hope to rise or fear to fall :
To greet the triumph of the youthful spring .
But paris showed another sight ,
Tho ' thee alone i see ,
As rhymes direct the rage of art .
The secret of the joy we gave .
By north samaria stands , and on that side
Apollo comes , the dances to restore .
It chanced the song that enid sang was one
From this hour the pledge is given .
To follow duty , joy , or gain ,
The furious blows thine arm has dealt .
That looks into god 's own eyes !
Through the fog it came ;
But when the may had turned to haws ,
Good news i bring , that now we may depart
Where perhaps some beauty lies ,
And then because two wishes met
Magdalen 's tall tower tipped with tremulous gold
And break the gift of many kings ,
To see where all the money goes so fast .
That sees through tears the mummers leap ,
And led by luxury disease 's trains ,
From him , if heaven were gained by sin .
It does not vent its loathing , does not turn
Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air
And sleep stood trembling face to face with death .
Each mother ’s heart can form a notion ;
Finds to save child its life it lost .
Through frosty hills the journey lay ,
That a downfall soon must come to pass .
Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell ,
My power shall shield the youth from harm ,
There he makes his court and seat ,
Wave-rocked , and passion tossed .
To make a speck of darkness on the sun ?
And starting from her bed , by passion warmed ,
And the crucifix went by .
To bless the turf that wraps their clay ;
But ' mid the tumult sails are spread .
And clear the depths where its eddies play ,
Wherever my dreams go , you are always there ,
As cool it comes along the grain .
The autumn wind goes sighing
The place my letters wait for me ,
Fearful : strong serpents breathing forth the blast
And the snows come hurrying from the hills ,
Still lingers in the lines we lay
To make it appear i my trust did defend .
His spirits shall never fail !
With bitter groans his sorrows he express ’d ,
Tuned to heroic deeds , and set on high
To their challenge made no answer ,
No lustre lost that life had given ;
That keeps the wear and polish of the wave .
And watched his proud sails filling for cathay .
And the broad leaves swung lazily beside the glade .
Within the land that gave him birth ;
And i did feel his happiness mine own ,
Till the sun and moon changed places ,
Thy conquests bought . thou hast not to forgive
Assured this heart would gladly bear
A mighty longing feels the goat
( the pilot made reply )
And this the gods thereafter brought to pass .
Whose eyes alone her unveiled graces meet ,
Or seek protection down in hell ,
Then raised diana clamorous dispute ,
For ariel there his sports to keep ;
Let the rust their armour eat .
And left in every age a deathless fame .
Nor , though we hold the sacred dances good ,
And the sun sinks out of sight ,
That day by day in prayer like thine arise ;
Then the pleased king gives orders to prepare
And domes that swelled against the sky !
To soften into april . then we have
A single field which i have looked upon ,
He that went happy and healthy and human there --
In southern parts before rebellion stirred ,
Finding at last that words are not the word ,
This makes the madmen who have made men mad
His azure length in easy waves extends ,
Like fragrance borne on the hush of the wind .
The spiring stone that scaled about her tower ,
In one ’s own house what doubt is shown ?
And up it a cricket was climbing .
So the balmy minutes pass ,
They mark the youths amid the twilight grey .
Fired with anger , threatened vengeance ,
The morning came above the serried coast ,
O , what to tender loves ye owe ,
Nor is felt the wealth of diamond dew , --
Where its continuous toil had scooped a well
The proud abbot , he saw .
To simple things the wonder they have lost .
One glance did fully all its secrets tell ;
Fierce comes the sable queen with fatal threat ,
We felt the minutes crawl :
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave .
The souls of those whom anger overcame ;
To save the lord the trouble .
But suddenly we miss some subtle grace ,
While big the tears of anguish pour ,
As briskly as she took the road .
The trail was taken up next day
To get at their secret at all unfairly .
Dear hearts to love -- sweet ties to bind --
And boughs that let the gold between .
Inconstant ! to admit the bridal hour . "
A midway station given ,
Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited
To move remorse where favour is not borne ,
Then slow he went , and to this fiend
The visions departed , and shame followed passion : --
His secrets , to be scanned by them who ought
Nature made every fop to plague his brother ,
And of the gentle breezes take their fill ;
How the boat drew homeward filled with flowers .
To thrust aside their dullness or their sadness
To rear himself , and new defence to make :
Setting the night aflame with carbuncles
We see such draping splendours thrust ;
Which with its whiteness loves to be allied .
The brownies ' round a comrade drew ,
That dead love shalt thou never meet ,
New ways to show his skill to wondering eyes .
That fills my heart with sadness !
Where philip 's steps were led ,
Echoed her blasphemies , as with shrill voice
Whose pining visions dim , forbidden hopes profound ,
Gloomy as night he stands , in act to throw
Crackled in hissing smoke ; nor gather 'd flame
" ere dawn broke , the smoke ascended ,
And engaged in a pretty romance .
Their sons , they gave , their immortality .
The sea cuts off from persia 's southern marge ,
They rise for freedom and clean laws
How thou art come into a happy land ? --
The errors of an age long passed away ? "
Round freedom 's shrine shall grow .
To feed upon the beauty of the moon !
Had come of many a grip in mastery ,
Tears in thy eyelids stand ,
With night 's soft mantle folded over all ,
And six days followed each other , and feeble
And towns and armies humbles to the dust
Mary that made god mirth ,
To strew the foam with mania and despair ,
The hornets hang an oblong nest .
( how came those tears on my face ? )
Change to a fury stained with blood and crime .
But heedless of those cares , with anguish stung ,
As if it lived anew .
While rich and poor its products share .
Swift as he spoke , the gallant northmen sprang
The nuptial ties by god were bound ,
Not as the world its boasted treasure gives ,
And shared the joys that nature owns ,
It almost makes me cry to tell
To take the imprint of his lord 's commands ;
Onward they drive , in dreadful race ,
Throughout the world will foul reproach be cast ,
Deeply thought and long reflected .
Happiness in his power left free to will ,
And stood on end and struck out sparks .
And away it proceeds ,
Unnoticed was suffered the evening to pass .
Oh , how can spring take heart to come
Open thy breast unto the truth that 's coming ,
So were they blinded by their angry heat .
Something thou hast to bear through womanhood ,
To feel the poison through her spirit creeping ,
The news has gone to his home , afar --
The muse , nae poet ever fand her ,
Peace o'er the earth her olive wand extend ,
And see what usury age shall take of youth
There as i came , by rumour led ,
Priests in white garments go , with sacred wands
Truth , truth only , should stand and say ,
Then your high lineage and your names declare ;
Its thoughts one moment turned from thee ,
Like ghosts of flowers returned , i see .
Within the bounds ordained by law divine .
That sprinkled with blood the cursed stones
Whose long progression leads to deity .
Not fiercer pangs distract the mournful dame ,
To whom thou gavest the law .
And soon he reached the palace of his sire .
It plagues your country . folly such as yours ,
Pour , let the wines of heaven pour !
Yet with her terror still her love did grow ,
And with his mercy washed and made them fair .
Nature delineates her whole chart at large ,
Astronomy that tracks the star ,
And the primordials come not forth to light ,
But the winter froze it out .
Smoothing the waves the colours run --
Longer to make sermons of ,
Must all his powers employ .
Triumphal arch , that fills the sky
Merit the scorn they meet from little men .
Assume thy greatness , for the time draws nigh ,
Yet , if your heart receive , behold !
He never stop a night away , not ever .
Which passes from the parent to the child .
October goes , and its colors pass :
Filling the air with music wild and sweet .
Sorrow may reign for a night ,
" of justice shall be closed upon thy crime ?
And with heroic courage held these fast ,
And he 'll pass outspent as his father went
His mighty standard . that proud honour claimed
Know , death must come and love must come ,
The fires of darkness are blown down .
Oppression , prisons , have no power to bind ,
Often sung when i was building ,
Of nature , and not fill the world at once
Constant they follow , where injustice flies .
The seventh angel lifted high his trump ,
Would that keep you , would that hold you ,
The lord kept making him thus bend
No sooner are the winds at point to rise ,
Thy cheeks with health 's roses spread ,
Where royal roses bloomed and blushed
To render marriage holy and divine ;
Spirits , who came loud wailing , hurried on
Evil will bless , and ice will burn . '
While , over all , a thousand beacons burn .
How yet the regal aspect he retains !
Of life returned . with fitful quivering
The heart 's echoes render
O what care i where love was born ;
The tumult and the shouting dies --
Hath met love 's noon in nature 's night ;
All bloodless lay the untrodden snow ;
All now was turned to jollity and game ,
That any prycke myght them stand .
That monarch made as vigorous as whilere .
Their flag to april 's breeze unfurled ,
The greek soul grown effeminate .
They fitted foreign ( god keeps the sea ) ,
The candles fall a-dying ,
Reach me thy hand and guide me home ,
Alternately their shifting hands they plied .
As loath to fall out of those happy skies ;
Of all flowers that breathe and shine .
And there the mischief stood . then , strife arose
The song went with them in their flight ;
Fearless and well content i lay ,
And said , before the geese they take ,
The city of jerusalem to sway ,
In purple clusters hangs the vine 's increase ,
Armed as ye see , to tilt against the knights
To find the meaning of his mark :
And lo ! his weariness was gone
Which made him burst through honour 's laws
Frail shoulders bent to bear
As if bursting with cheer .
Stirred by the silver oars of poems passing .
Down go the titles ; and the statue crowned ,
Thick blood in rain they shed ;
To make us happy , and hath he not sight
When they in endless song their strength have spent .
To seek the lore that in them lurks
And theirs it is to make it flow --
Gray and melt into her flesh .
( for all and every comfort found he here )
In chords melodious , swelled or sank , until
Surely my heart cried out that it was thou ,
But i have put aside this folly , being gay
A single warrior half a host sustains :
My soul their vigil joins , and shares
In the orchards dangling red and yellow ,
And my night-flowering heart that yields
Then trembling seized me and , amidst my fear ,
Sent down to set the pagan people free ,
Thine envied wealth , and when on thee shall fall
For the townsfolk unto the mote to pass ,
The spoils and treasures he to ilion bore
She a long season wandered through the world .
And give my heart relief . "
And fighting hard against his fate .
Not that a token needs his love to bind :
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
And avarice , lent their spurs to industry ;
When numbers burst what bound before ,
Still without end the world beyond it lies ;
Henceforth no credit give ;
Verse murmured , and philosophy did strain
Could there the step of happiness be traced .
I never knew what made it home .
A lasting record may be found with god ! --
And rapture felt that thrilled me through
So shall the blankets which come over me
While all the gloom that round them rolled
Nations have knelt to for the keys of heaven !
Some sweet responsion which the bosom hears ,
Where a day or two we harboured :
No unhappiness came nigh thee ;
That death must swallow life , and darkness light .
In whom god breathed an equal spirit once !
My sad heart broken with dismay ,
Unknown to them , when sensual pleasures cloy ,
Unless alarm came from the camp of love :
With clamour : for among them rose a cry
For the fear that covered her ;
Of his lord shall sit and receive a reward ;
In the very words which follow :
Joys to balance every care ;
The love that 's ordered to bathe in wine ,
To breathe forth all my sweetness .
" the devil take his wisdom ! " said
The king , his adoration paid ,
To level with the dust a noble horde ,
My illusions , my youth overcame ,
Cold pour 'd the sweat in freezing rill ;
Naught now remained for them but to unite
And to their chief the hand of friendship gives ,
But when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt ,
The general brawn is built for plans of his
Roman law , when i recall it ,
Until his very steps have left a trace
That rather greece from us these arts derived --
“ a crow which bore a dead man ’s leg
And tendrils broke that held us two how dearly !
Unconquer 'd still the warrior race remain .
Tears rush ’d down the visage of the hero :
Down with the vows we 've made ,
Undue attachment will but make our losses more severe .
Comes the flutter and gleam of forest-leaves
There comes the stress of labour ; this
What news to all alike brings startling sorrow ?
Which turns their sufferings all to bliss ?
Whom , not till seventy years had sped ,
Fortune hath set aboven alle :
And quickly to the task he went ,
There come a thousand thoughts of sunny weather ,
And lightens life 's eternal cross
And if thoughts came recalling things
A rosy spectre smiling to the tomb ;
And heaviest , light of foot steals fast away .
This will bring us into disgrace !
Beneath the lowest spheres . earth barred the space
And unto kings made known ,
Back to the hostile ranks from which it came ;
Condensed , the battle yelled amain ;
And ancient strife recalling , thus replied :
Fill the air with words of anguish :
Her interest is in all the advice she gives ;
And thrice like a wounded dove she came
The mists of time are backward rolled ,
A sound came from the land ;
And tell if some torment there still can be wrung
Red with the blood that flows
But sure to be all set right in heaven ,
Will i evade , nor give thee false reply ,
Although they left his altar blank and bare ;
Earth wasted and riven with iron and fire .
A lingering second look to cast ,
When he saw this he was forced to doubt
To far more lordly thoughts would stir 'em .
And gave orders to the household :
But time resumes his dark and hideous reign ;
Of bonaparte and waterloo hath filled
And my heart owns a doubt
While the heroes fell to weeping ,
Such strange effects , such passions it torment ,
When january comes with wind and sleet ,
This made you great and won you love .
The next day came a neighbor . blues and reds
Of aventine spread oft a lake of blood .
Or like those envious pearls that show
Do you stand right up to the work ahead
An ' scotland drew her pipe an ' blew ,
Shone from their blue depths , and old dreams awoke
Didst meditate the lesson nature taught ,
Shakes the sacred lodge with terror ,
The anvil of his speech received the hammer ,
I come to counsel learned in the law :
And sins opposing them asunder tear .
Bring us the smiles of the olden days ;
A light the darkness doth dispel .
And homeward went again the kingless folk .
He poured his frenzy forth in song , --
His winged shaft with eager haste he sped .
By looking on the vengeance which , concealed ,
Think what ancient gossips might say ,
And to dark oblivion join thee ! "
I finde write a wonder thing .
Had not plucked a handful when night came !
The gateway 's broken arches rang ;
Mid the ruin its madness too often hath made ,
When pain and anguish wring the brow ,
Of the same virgin , thy destruction met ;
Are cooled to the calm of forgiveness ;
And winter 's now come fairly .
Distinctly by ulysses named , was moved
You have missed the moral of the play .
That there with measure they no spending made .
Now the said contractress declares she would rather
The cradle rocked and made its moan ,
Even so that amorous spirit , bound
As waves which beat their troubled bark about .
Ere beatrice descended to the world ,
But yet some saving counsel may we give ,
But time can not weaken the ties love creates ,
So the multitude goes like the flower or the weed
Warm from thy red lips circling round me !
But this insult roused such anger ,
But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
Great saints have made their dwelling there :
Which make the phoenix ' urn and nest .
And every wave that broke its heart of gold
But the sad dove , that sits alone
To whom his charge the monarch gave .
Stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief .
Received and followed by a prayer ,
Repentance offered ecstasy in pain .
With knowledge and desire put by .
Opposed their breasts , and stood themselves the war .
And with due care thy horses tend . ”
The finest , biggest fish , you see ,
How shocking ! it makes folly thrice a fool ;
A cherished gloom , that wishes not relief .
Of the iron rivers that fashioned hell !
All truths wait in all things ,
And leave to truth each noble name
The house from which the heavens are fed ,
Then i can shut my eyes and feel the pain
The tide is talking .
Lo , all these wonders work by natural law ,
Where memory lives , a saint enshrined --
She cast not back a pitying eye :
And thy light laughter rang as clear
The grief that can get leave to run
Her faith in dawn was lost .
But bold assurance sometimes wins the day .
Bringing its thousand joys thy heart to fill .
The thoughts that burned and glowed within .
Thou in such a cloud dost bind us ,
Of christmas bursting flower-like with the prayer ,
And the storm flies ragged . slowly
With love 's wild frenzy then possessed ,
Echoed with laughter as , with amber eyes
And lead our pathless thoughts astray .
And in our place the heavens possess he must ,
That to our folly or our guilt we owe .
To rise and take our liberty .
That set my northern blood aflame ,
Go on , until this land revokes
The proverb says : one 's own warm hearth
But when a dream night after night is brought
For to church it never went ,
Let the dream go . are there not other dreams
The country foak did gape an ’ luke ,
As a silver stream may run ,
Its height ascended , where two cressets hung
In the end it will speak and not lie .
And take thy penance for thy part ,
Neglected virtue , seasons go and come ,
And fed her faith with silent things ,
That gave me gains , nor hurt my pride .
So that it makes them greedy for revenge ,
The man of prayer can only draw
Verdict found , and sentence passed .
When the low sun had dropped behind the hills ,
Swelled the fiend ’s lips , his body shook
My parboiled thoughts will fondly turn ,
Now when fifteen sunny summers thus were spent ,
Or mars his grove , or hollow winds that blow
Making powerless the lightnings of mischance .
From troy , a veil , whose saffron edges shone
Which life maintain 'd by others ' idle breath .
A lessening image , trembling thro ' their tears .
So rose the day and widened into morning glow
" greatly his opera 's strains intend ,
To show the wisdom of his love ;
In his compassionate gaze , grubbed smoothly out ,
All day , and to the going down of day
Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old
While with th ' inspiring muse my bosom glowed ,
A doom that ever poised itself to fall ,
And she swifter springs to the rising seas ,
Enjoy it still , therein i take no pleasure ;
Why mourning comes , by bliss convey 'd ,
Hence all the good from opulence that springs ,
The raging winds rush thro ' the hollow wound ,
_ for only rubbish comes my way . _
That hath made fatal entrance here ,
Music has no heart to follow ,
Where now great busy cities stand .
Now for the panics that never fail !
Have goblins seized thy soul , o dame ,
The message that the setting sun shall send .
To hide your worship ; and i understood ,
The words you breathed have reached his ear ;
Tooth of rat the way must clear .
A radiant thing made out of dreams ;
Like a soft pillow offered for the head ,
Lest brave ships drive and break against the shore .
Laughing water draws around it ,
A new blood filled the herbs ,
And with grim laughter thrust us out at gates .
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
So then this silence doth reveal
Yet on his breast the missile broke .
Grasping his spear , forth issued to arouse
On faithless love till life would cloy ,
Before the stars have left the skies ,
Ere that light burned there in the central pane
Archduchess anne sat carved in frost ,
Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
I felt as one might feel who should behold
When justices hold equal scales ,
The god of life has placed it there .
" now the time has come for parting
And name a counsel for the trees --
Analyse worlds that long since passed away ,
The picture news was suddenly pushed in .
And where my treasures lie , from my own stores
My heart was filled with marvel and dream ,
Not mine those moments when the roses lay
And saw his dreams come true .
Except on religion , none ventured to speak --
Love to a storm of passion growing , swept
Like lotus leaves his full eyes beamed :
With all the woes which follow sin ;
Hell trembled at the hideous name , and sighed
Gave me to face the orient . nor our way
We rub clothes with a fate that hurries past !
Like some great mountain set upon the plain ,
The birds are to their haunts withdrawn ,
My forces put to rout ;
Or fill with sudden tears the eyes that read .
A warmer couch with numerous carpets spread .
With mad rage . strife incarnate spurred them on ,
Those ten which he maintained , to bloody fight ;
That blew to blazing all my hate ,
With him the palace into smoke would go .
And saw love 's flames within them burning bright ,
A rose-flushed figure putting by the grey ,
And bore by turns the wholesome cane
Her art pursuing in the spider 's shape .
And while the tears unceasing ran
" okba lifts the arm of death ,
That lay along the boughs , instinct with life ,
Time only makes the subtle ferment strong .
From the pillar struck three colors ,
In such a mansion , as scarce thought finds words
While death chokes loudest injuries :
Where the gay vessels go ,
Giving thee an air that 's somewhat better fitted
Like the shining soul of a jest ;
The balm thy touch to mortal bruises brings .
It made him whistle , it made him sing ;
And the broad blown breaths of the sea .
Since satan fell , whom folly overthrew ,
Vengeance follows after crime ,
Blessed , who brought to gracious birth
Forgot the careful prologue he 'd prepared ,
This maxim i give to a youth of nineteen ;
Yet all the flock jumped on the same .
Flowers in veins of trees ; bringing such peace
And oft in clouds is wholly lost .
Armed burghers kept their watch and ward .
While to the fleet atrides bends his way .
Two wrongs do n't make much of a right .
The monarch agamemnon saw , and thus
" it will melt when comes the summer . "
And art reflected images to art .
Hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim ,
That i was heard with favour ; peace returned
From their dilated orbits bound before
A finch , whose tongue knew no control ,
By weariness and woe too great to bear .
The scene may fade that gave them birth ,
So the infinite runs away .
She , with a voice in sadness lost ,
I have possessed more joy than earth can lend :
In his own bosom delves ,
A sound came from the land ;
Only made the fire burn brighter ,
To which no single sacrifice may fall ;
And find forgiveness where the shadows stir
Many a jest told of the keys betraying
Therefore i seek the faith that sets it right
And it is not touched with blight .
Nor once turned back to give her thanks :
The sorrow that brings thee its pain .
My love and fortune first did run ;
And so , that the sick the salvation may find
Then a wind rose behind me . so we met
Her dreaded arm a beamy javelin bore ,
For using thy name offers fifty excuses .
Time has watched them pause and pass
And hearts were weary and nigh to break ,
The quaint old carvings loom ,
We rarely note the flutter of his wing .
Wyllyam shot so wonderous well ,
And tear the twinkling stars from trembling sky .
When darkness filled the earth till the ninth hour .
And our souls are filled with thee .
Out of the night that mighty voice arose ;
The spear receiving from the hand , he placed
Who is directed by a wife
Tormented chaos found repose .
And thrice the mournful answer came ,
Glory may to my god be brought .
That fills its circle in the sky .
Resolved to share his fortune in the field .
Are drawn , a bloody slaughter to achieve .
And may some other harp give praise ,
The strong thigh and the agile thigh were met ,
She , trusting to the pledge she held ,
I can hear their voices calling ,
Half the answer hangs upon a thread !
The sea i sail has never yet been passed ;
And gentle wishes long subdued ,
No word they utter 'd could our ears retain ;
He trembles lest the rites proceed ,
Provided it do hopeless hang ,
But never the fluted pipes shall go
Doth cause the ocean to attend upon her ,
Seeing that it portrayed his enemy .
Where the rain may fall upon me ,
There passed a weary time . each throat
To see thy charms displayed .
Of retribution fiercely works in me . "
When winter stript the summer 's bowers .
An ' what d'you reckon ail her ?
The dangerous path that i was treading in ;
And roman triumphs rising on the gold :
And molten fire are singing songs of hate ,
Fighting alone , worn to the bone ,
This saw the sacred mother of the gods ,
Such serene tidings moved such human smart .
Culled from the mountained slain where havoc sprawled
The brothers have put off the plumes of war ,
That swept those golden strings .
The woods and fields their pleasing toils deny .
And from th ' immortal gods their lineage came .
But mark you , if her pride shall stoop ,
Give us love , and give us peace ! "
And , wedged in hollow blooms , the bees
And melts my passion 's mortal cry
Thus long debating in himself he stood :
Why should we leave the soil our fathers cleared ,
All in the river reflected in quiet colours .
Where love and wisdom shall lie hid ,
The wild-rose breathes its wild perfume ;
To tutor me a better course to lead .
Although against them come ,
It shows me how precious the moments that fly .
And every tremulous longing , stirred
Look loveliest in , shed their luxurious glow
Suns beat on them ; tempests downpour ,
Mist and silence poured like wine , --
Transfigured by the light of her own passion ,
Refer the choice to fill the vacant throne .
Prepared with joy the road to take ,
And victory sing .
Giving notice of the feast-day
May bear the broadening type of man .
Yielding to pangs too great to bear ,
Kings are -- feed what brings the fruit . "
And days of joy and gaiety were spent .
But he who takes his cross and follows christ
Subtly under my skin runs fire ecstatic ;
Fills all the air with a languid perfume .
We gave no other bond .
Nor tears latinus from his purpose stayed ,
Shall give me an ounce of gold so bright ;
From bowl to bowl the homely beverage flows ;
On sell , that rich beyond all custom showed .
We went two and two ,
Then he spoke the words which follow :
Making wild music bold and high ,
Nash breathed the words that raised the veil anew ,
Excepting there where joy is made eternal .
The forest wilds around him spread ?
And now there came both mist and snow ,
Shook , and a trembling seized the temple door .
But , when first he breathed his vow ,
Whose hands , unseen , the tenfold storms control ;
Blind bartimeus , hold thy peace !
To melt in full satiety of grief ! "
That earlier loosed the knot great newton tied , "
A harsher truth might teach
It can not bring less than gladness ,
A sense of shame -- yet mixed with satisfaction ,
And on palm sunday bore his bough of green .
The barren slopes that fall away
Livid and yellow the green landscape lies .
While tears of rage stand burning in their eye .
Or the wreck that struck last tide --
And thankfulness because the world was wrought
In woods bright venus with adonis strayed ;
Had given him to the headsman 's stroke ,
And , filled with honest anger , overthrew
Since michael gives no roast nor stew ,
What i felt and i suffered i told .
Not if the way through demons led
And panic sent to myriad furtive things
In drizzling penance found relief ;
Walls and ceilings creaked and murmured .
And yet they made a starry call --
Gone thy sway o'er savage natures ;
Maids , to this day , their story tell :
Who is the angel that cometh ?
To bosoms where only resentment may dwell ;
Along the christian 's path as he pursues
Since christians antioch did to bondage bring ,
Is some late death lined there , alas ? -
No touch gave she to hound in leash ,
Great guns let it blow , high or low ,
Snapping at roughnecks who made foolish howls ,
The brave and base in equal honor stand ,
The flowery path , by pleasure led .
The sharp , sharp arrow sent i.
And then a fear such bliss might leave me .
My great travail so gladly spent ,
This stood while hector and achilles raged .
But caught a sort of chill ;
A song of menace rumbled . thus he came ,
I saw that things were getting serious ,
Where the place lay ; and still more few
To find a king their freedoms to support :
His talk was like a stream which runs
Or to the thousand things i found to tell .
And brave the imminent doom , and fix his faith
Of worth and might the noble badge he bore ,
Without however the apprehensions attributed to the pagan
Crowned with the mingled blossoms held their feast :
Was choked with grief and terror too .
O minstrel harp , still must thine accents sleep ?
Who raise , in turn , your wrath .
Clouds follow clouds , and mountains mountains urge ;
If but a friendly hint be thrown ,
The strain with rapture that with fire was penned .
No weak uncertain plans they made .
Sing at thy mother 's breast . month followed month
His sire , when in the wood he laid
" i willingly to thee this truth impart ,
Thus threatened us , and made us thus afraid .
But serve his will ;
A nice and suttle happiness i see
As though it drifted down from a star .
Her waiting face to waiting heaven turned ,
His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs .
In shades of horror leave the world to mourn ,
Bring they fresh tidings of the pestilence ?
Did come from too much sunshine . her alarms
To fiercer , weightier battles give expression .
And the latin taught by the old friar
Love looked back as he took his flight ?
And rome 's wide empire trembled at his name .
There came an eastern voice of solemn mood : --
What hope in flight , what power to stand ,
The lovely lights across the marshes pass ,
Decay and silence sadly drape
Shall from this mass of sin be freed .
Whence tyber first unlocks his mighty flood . "
A happy fate now hovers round thee ,
He raised a cry , by woe distraught ,
“ thy own demerits ask : take the reward
And love shall make our spirits gay . ”
Three things another 's modest wishes bound ,
And odors fill the air ;
And spreads the seas with silvery light .
With a noise of rains that rumble .
" ' taste the food that stands before you :
That leads unto thy sacred street .
And from her breast all sorrow drove .
And the sobs of the mounting waves that rise
My forces put to rout ,
An ' each took aff his several way ,
Down to oblivion going ,
And kept credit with my heart ,
Who taunts the ordeal should the fire have tried .
A cloud hung over the darkened brow --
" without one virtue left to shield the blow ;
The warm wind comes in rushes ,
And mean deeds creep to darkness from her gaze .
The castle betokens a date long gone by .
And clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts ,
Celestial truth , revealed certainty !
Of sleep , declare that strife allows short truce ;
And trifles make him sick and pale ;
But of a single combat fame speaks clear . "
Of golden horns that sang to rest
For me , nor may thy courtesy prevail .
This line ran thus in the first edition :
I fairly lost my temper in the fight ,
To stay the foe from fooling ,
When toil my aged strength subdued ,
Which made their marriage prospects bright and cheering ,
For swift as lightning came the thought to me ,
Took all the romance out of me .
And the dark moons beat
Tournaments stricken , and the joustings run ,
Drawing threads that they were weaving ,
Laid on the icy and immovable lips .
Most of all when lunch is laid
Of sweet praise i truly feel .
Then runs along with public plagues and woes ,
Foreseen , which would be given by certainty !
The battle lost , no help nor hope remained ;
With other things the doctor brings
Parted , alas ! i carry from its source ,
The big blue ocean lies around in the sun
To send life flowing somehow through me ;
Can break the gloom of an eternal night ;
As after winter follows spring ;
Beloved thrush , pour forth your notes divine !
A horn 'd magician locked in death ,
As she and the sunshine came :
" flies from thee , soon she shall follow ,
Above the city hangs the moon ,
From what far land are the boughs ye bear ,
As his last hour ran its sand ,
The shade of him magnanimous made reply ,
Gives hope and fervor , nearer draws his theme ,
For all to seek increasing scripture light ,
The fires burn 'd upon the altar bright ,
Unfinished morning fades and slips away .
With blazing stars and gliding fires for gold ,
And homage pays to that dread might ,
She brooks no man 's control ,
Resign whatever did of life remain ,
The pile went on embodying ,
Fire ascending seeks the sun :
Those tones which make the music of the past .
Plastered upon them by foul mists that rise ,
Take care they do n't tumble through crevices small ,
So hollow , and so faintly blown ,
And next the prussians . this to set afoot
Till the dread penalty be paid .
Are given that lovers never may
The new melodies in beauty reached the divine .
Driven with that weak blast which winter leaves
Both urge their oars , and fortune both supplies ,
In italy shall wage successful war ,
That the dazzled people followed ;
And smooth as a snow-cloud could go .
And seeks to woo them to a brighter world .
Light as entrailed blossoms , that shalt find
The heat commanding in my heart doth sit .
Hast thou his prowess never seen ?
Sounds of bells came faintly stealing ,
The family vault receives another lord .
There they went ,
Derive incitements to renew thy rage ;
First enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls
What though no credit doubting wits may give ,
Let mercy shed the soft and manly tear ,
With random slaughter drives the adventurous train ;
Afar will democracy chase it ,
At length the aged priam gave command :
I trust god 's finger points it also out .
Your fortune i 'll make then straightway . "
The truth the wise men sought
We give the slip , we steal away ,
The direction playful winds blew
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead ,
From the dark pulpit , and our gaze there met
Then came the guard that never knew repose ,
Turning the heroine 's zeal to tears , --
Whose height misplaced may pierce me like a shame ,
A laden sleep draws with its heavy breath
Wherein she suffering , all her spirits languish ,
To drown my broad , deep misery .
And these girls who swing their oars
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway ,
And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth ,
That thou hast thy health recovered
Colored like green wood when flame kindles it .
While the sun allows .
No baffled hope or memory darkly clad ;
The happiest heart that ever beat
Yet bravely hold their ground ;
Is delft , with all its wares displayed ;
That made her face an ashen pale ,
A theme for poetry , you see --
Threatens him , plunged in that abortive gulf .
Were severed from the haunts of men
Gives hope and fervor , nearer draws his theme ,
I strive to bring into the light of day ;
And darkness straightway stole across the deep ,
Made promise of the way her sect enjoins .
Astern and to leeward lies the land ,
Grant that the lord of all saw fit
Breath 's a ware that will not keep .
In britain 's court kept up the game ;
To show the beauty and power of life .
To hint at a life to come .
As morning hears before it run
The princes set their faces for the mount .
Like a jealous frenzy wrought ,
In conflict rang their cry of might ,
And through their hollow aisles it plays
Where portals swing forever in
When southern change of kings brought sorrow ,
The knight that to our foes new tidings brings ,
A sunbeam fell and lit with mystic grace
To warkworth cell the echoes rolled ,
A savage life he led and out of sight ,
Were strewn with shadows -- wavering and dim --
Can give a bliss o'ermatching thine ,
But something pricked and stung and numbed it .
Which , by thy mouth , apollo shall convey :
Round about him spun the landscape ,
To make its music heard .
Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare .
But thou hast got a bickering brother ,
Methinks i feel new strength within me rise ,
Comes like a wind and passes like a fire .
A clear will come after a cloudy day . _
My comrades devoured ; but my appetite failed me ,
Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came ,
The flying tidings whirled .
In hell itself , then , laws are reckoned ?
To conquer and to spare ; for coward souls
In her grief the words which follow :
While seven sands ran secretly . " --
Rose all around and filled her drowsy ears .
The flocks on flowery braes lay still ,
Where far from peaceful hearth and home lay strife ,
Where no disease reigns , or infection comes
Her heart knew no fear ;
This horseshoe will i nail upon the threshold .
The south wind always brings us rain ;
God will not leave my heart to break ,
Which sudden grew and grew , and turned the blue
They on a storm of laughter should be blown
The joy of her joy hath forever fled ;
All heaven leaned down to watch the exciting race .
It kindled in thine eyes the lovelight , showed
And the lines he well considers ;
Their fragrance forced by art too soon
To mark the summer 's mortuary .
Till the autumn 's floor is rolled
Would that my hand might gather here
Till freedom should her claims recall ,
But the words came softer , lower ,
A cat is catching flies on cushioned seats ;
My doom i find is fixed above ;
Unnnmber 'd towns and villages arise .
Through these th ' excited horses held their way .
But with the winds must go ,
Filling the air with praise ,
The hermit crowd around him pressed ,
To take of love a newe thorst ,
Touched the mist and made it glance
In a wind that makes no pause ....
A winged soul , flies through a joyful heaven .
Wild , send thee pleasure 's devious way ,
Comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears ,
Feeling pain the flame had given ,
To bring rome in unto the way of life ,
Straight through the stars , nor bending to the north
Whose sacred music e'er shall float
To win the worship of that prophet pure --
Contempt of death on cool reflection founded ,
Mourning some years , perhaps , healed partly then
By driving winds the spreading flames are borne !
To helpless hatred of him . the wind sang
So still and deep the water lies ,
And there we took one tutor as to read :
They bring the gods again ;
Tears that brought their meed .
Fate gave , what chance shall not control ,
Whereof there came that grief and mourning sore ,
Take on a tender tone .
Sorrow hath made thee more beautiful , sister ,
But the river of life went flowing ,
A spirit pent beneath the threshold lay ;
I yielded a love that 's thrown away ,
Yet love will dream and faith will trust ,
Drew near , his sorrow to expel ,
Of insects , which against you rise in arms .
And with their yelping voices make appear
The lake is folded softly by the shore ,
Even old kohen saw a journey south ,
Loath to rebuke my soul and bid it arise .
Wherever truth may lead , --
Of hope and faith , that make life wise ;
And he made oath to cherish them
And the hearth-stones sing in pleasure .
While their pure prayers like incense are ascending :
Green rioting on olden ways it falls :
There has sprung up a thriving town .
He sees no way through these perplexities ;
More benefits remain , and claimed as rights ,
June saw his father 's overthrow ,
Of love that swam the sparkling hellespont
It carried a shiver everywhere
So cobby went where nobby led .
Who pierced his heart as they encountering joined .
Yet the destroyer fate had lured him on
It would give me joy unceasing
Soon the weary thread be spun ,
Let brother unto brother give the hand ,
And in adding to his riches .
There shot a streaming lamp along the sky ,
His grounds however specious shown ,
Called down the dreams of sunset into stone .
But all things counter to the hopes ensue
Some quiet home that lies away ,
And here a while , where no wind brings
It comes to be the right , and then again
To feel the wildfire burn ,
For strength to serve thee still .
There is a settled trouble in his air
The prophet mission which his steps obey --
And the genial seasons run ;
And heels over head turned poor paddy malone .
Sweet dread doth o'er my spirit steal ,
Back to the world my thoughts are led ,
The moaning wind went wandering round
To your sharp judgement now made known ,
Blindly lost in folly 's maze ,
My heart was like an altar lit with flame ,
Due reverence paid to god above ,
The death that would have set me free .
The mists lie along the iris-purple valleys ;
And reasons for your failures began to arise
That runs so icy clear ;
I feel my spirit in my bosom fired
By affliction touched and saddened .
Our sorrows in sack shall lie steeping ,
Visions arise of a scene of mirth ,
But never shalt thou set thereon a name ,
And with a father 's sorrows mix his own !
I took sweet summer by her lovely hair ,
With fugitive things not good to swallow ,
Till on my breast a throbbing bosom lies ;
Of ages long gone by :
Upon their pastor , whom they viewed as bent
And turned him homeward as they prayed .
Scene appealed to fancy ; for , when
Through the shining hauberks cutting deadly way .
Ther fathers kept ther solemn voo ,
His wide eyes staring , blood upon his breast .
That goes to the beautiful , beautiful wood ;
There came a respite to her pain ;
Slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet
Be what ye dream ! and earth shall see
Do not give this suitor welcome ,
He could restore to health death-wounded men ,
That my familiar thoughts embrace
The boasting challenge ran ,
When these had passed , bearing upon his brow
Like breadths of topaz , packed a night ,
I struggle towards the light -- but oh ,
I saw it filled with foes ,
My clumsy mind knows how to put together ;
My fingers ran among the tassels faded ;
Made bliss more hard to bear than pain .
Nor blasted were their wedded days with strife ;
His mind at peace reads nature like a book .
Is it the wind that moaneth bleak ?
The glory from his gray hairs gone
Throughout the world your growing fame has spread ,
Where clustering rainbow-coloured bubbles clung
Active it finds , to its own substance draws ,
From warring matter -- wandering shot the star
Till the said sum be satisfied and paid . "
But when it comes to coupin ' horse ,
But with my numbers mix my sighs ;
A sudden horror struck their aching sight .
But their wise heart knows many things
My father also died , consumed with moan ,
To such a fair sight elsewhere could give birth ;
High muses ! let him hurry to the ending .
And the temples miss the priest --
For the rich help of books he always took ,
His arm around the lady threw :
I take the day as it behaves ,
" one that carried me in infancy ,
And let him make his great discoveries there .
Its violence past death and what is seen .
Nods , and becks , and wreathed smiles
The procession moves off in a double quick pace ,
And praises clamorous shall make for all
Or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains ,
This subtle speech was aimed to please
In the museum too , his cain , that stands
With that he passed on sadly , and i knew
When loneliness hath somewhat touched his brain ,
Slowly the sea went down as the wind fell .
Glory doth follow , courage goes before ;
Athena tore away the nightmare-fiend
Pale as the light the moon beams shed ,
The final course was ushered in at last ,
Of the strange rapture that thy features know ? "
With what it takes away ; the voice of birds
The tidings to his master bore :
Then rose the shout of giants loud
Doth every beast keep holiday ; --
To please my host and meet my reckoning ;
And misses teased the hunger of his brain .
“ behold , o king , the car prepared :
To numbers bow 'd each list ' ning hill ;
Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently ,
Oil made he and wine anew , and taught mankind
It chanced that while the pious troops of france
The future only holds thee and can hold thee .
And when his rain was spent and from clear skies
As from the cloud the forked lightning glared .
And the fire gives no assistance .
That drains the blood of suffering men ;
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead ,
Then sweeps the royal esther by ;
Where friendship dwells an ' freedom reigns ,
But mighty terror came on all
It drew to the great gate of the northern way
I bring the gift of faith .
Across the leagues that sink and rise
The wind has gone to sleep within the trees --
Only made the fire burn brighter ,
And all things set in good array !
It was falling by candle-light too .
And the long line comes gleaming on ,
To reap the harvest of our midnight hair ;
I will make answer even to the thought ,
It settled , sunk to his left hand ,
The wind , the tempest roaring high ,
For love has bound me hand an ' fit ,
The chest wherein its might reposed ,
And straight their flames with tenfold fierceness burn :
Fast mounting in rebellion , since in vain
When cupid brings a pair of hearts ,
Dead are the lips where love laughed or sang ,
And watched the languid hours pass ;
The lion-haunted thickets hold apart .
From yonder east he springs ,
Lotus and lily blooms expand .
And thither on that eve the tidings flew :
He stayed the game to breathe some words of love
In its top , there shines the moonlight ,
Nor can be torn asunder without death .
Those delphic lines with deep impression took ,
When heaving sighs afford their soft relief ,
The tears and takes the farewell of each friend ,
Two planets rushing from aspect maligne
Where tears shall fall or have of old --
Both your fortunes to blend
Bravely i fare forth into night --
The ancient greek his chariot ran ,
Such power his fervent rites had won .
Like the full moon in heaven displayed ;
To pierce the years with a joyous tear ;
Many a widow raises the mournful shriek ,
His cherished wish that would have made
Melting away like southern snows ,
When fierce orlando deals the fatal blow .
Of beryl tint should make a ring ;
It prates of rifled mint and thyme .
The proclamation made for may :
And met with mighty showers and pouring rain
But as they reached its shore ,
The trees are afraid to put forth buds ,
Strong in the strength that penance earned ,
Of pale green leaves that made the sapphire deep
I put my trumpet , with its stress and noise
Of homely toil , may serve to show
Purple with beating blood of the hallowed grape .
Their joy , whose heart is swift to feel
The sun dissolves frost 's mantle hoary ,
A curse upon each king who leads his state ,
When daylight is gone and darkness brings dread ,
Comes a pause in the day 's occupations ,
And her own in the shroud lay stark ;
To his ear there came a murmur
Yet are scarce ripe enough at best to show
To his youngster take his treat !
The vow which god among his angels hears --
My muse pronounce aloud , there 's nothing good ,
Is given by joy to me .
What made my heart so sore ?
My bindings up would break thee ,
But her mother to her cries made answer :
With sloth hath found it difficult to dwell ;
Could not restrain her glowing rage ,
The red rays pierce the waters flowing
Each shadow makes him stop , each murmur stay :
Our mystic art and skill to show ;
The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
The biting axe of florence . farther on ,
Charged with delicious wine . they , turning , wrought
About him winged blessings stand
Such lords deserved ill the other house to fill .
As the nations sat together , grimly waiting --
Semblance of worth , not substance , gently raised
And hear the music of her fountains play ?
One seed of spring has well returned its twenty ,
Now sees glide through the heavenly courts which lie ,
Shall call down wretchedness and shame ,
Before the years of doubt and trouble came .
He slew ; dread groans arose of dying men
That led great ships to anchor in the night
All that had come within his observation ,
The former he four million slaves set free .
Wherein he showed the reason why ,
The air is sweet with violets , running wild
Who dimly hearest voices call on thee ,
To follow half on which the eye dilates
His sword sir axel well can handle . ”
The flowers that spring upon the clyde
And very pale . the minutes pass ;
That strange old story still comes true . --
And drop a smile to the bringer ;
The plain is endless space expressed ;
Those eager eyes gaze on and banish sleep ;
The watchful guard upon him swept ;
In melancholy gloom , the pinnace passed ;
And missals wrought by hooded monks ,
Where lay no weapon , till the last
But skulls of mantling mead they hold ;
And all the palace household , followed them
Held out for her annuity .
That airy cadence stooped and bore me in .
The wife made battle for him with his friends ;
The fleet behind was jamming ; the monitor hung
Mark how the shifting winds from west arise ,
And bonds your aching body keep ? "
Ulysses braced for decency his loins
Occasions , find we still to mourn .
Her love thought to obtain ;
Of evils , and , excessive , overturns
Only to sink and die within his heart .
To soften each corroding hour ,
He learns to use a hundred cunning wiles .
Would hold you pounded here through all the seasons ?
And kings with commons share one dust .
" my child , the chase i follow far ,
One in whose love , i felt , were given
What but sands or snows hath earth to give ?
Though dust has spread the long-abandoned boards ,
Inseparablie thine , to him shalt beare
A witness may be brought to swear a lie ,
Yet feel no heat but what our loves impart ,
None stays to question if the road be fair .
Around thy brow a glory she hath thrown ;
To share the joy such scene would kindle there !
But fatal voyages , alas , they make :
And that apocalypse turns thee pale ;
As night is withdrawn
Love , in a generous heart set soon aglow ,
And all the time fate had his end prepared .
Of days has rifled of his strength .
The twilight standing lingers ,
This to the lunar sphere directs the fire ,
On slumbering lids to draw anew
He had pledged a hate unto me and mine ,
His strength was broken , his heart was bursting ,
But sore it ached , and fast it beat ,
The calm of prayer comes to men ,
The starry host , by gloomy silence led ,
The happy spring in buds expression found .
And held communion with the angels . so
How vast a change an hour may bring !
But ere i half-way reached the end ,
Because it fears not change ; enter thou in ,
But give to the living thy passion of tears
Nor for a party give his vote :
And lived her life with curbed white wings ,
Then grateful greece with streaming eyes might raise
Thereupon fiercely arose in our men the stern resolution
And like two lofty pines in death they lay .
I shrink in despair from the task !
Many a jest told of the keys betraying
Thy mortal passage when it comes . ascend
And then drew my consent ;
To raise the storm of bravery .
For fairy law says that a fairy must die
For beauties that from worth arise
Should serve the strivings of a widening age ,
They bore the burden from the wood .
Bridal rites go on so slowly ?
From a twig 's having lashed across it open .
Gold and snow he mixeth in spite ,
Thereto in angry accents sir gunther made reply ,
And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts ,
The flame that fired your embers ? ...
The glass that had whirled us thither away :
Of crowded ocean , took his way .
That nourished them and gave them birth ,
-- for god has taken sight from me !
" now i make thee truthful answer ,
And so she lives , and plays her part .
Hearts that with rising morn arise !
Were counted fearful sin .
Blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend
Unwilling tears could summon ,
Such food as falls to simple servants ' share ;
The good stars met in your horoscope ,
Thus addressed his fleeing people :
From which it follows he had strong
( clear are his old eyes burning ) ,
God , what a shining handful of happiness ,
" the middle distance , too , is placed
Some , as prisoners , draw breath .
And journeying eastward , eden found at last !
Greater than our strength can bear ,
Unto temptation god exposeth some ,
Twilight , a timid fawn , went glimmering by ,
And the warder 's voice hath treason sung ;
The fangs that tore his father 's throat .
The race of brahma comes .
And self-dissolution is barred .
Words unkind were heaped upon me ,
The way to vanquish or evade ;
A growl of fierce approval answered him ,
Who is the angel that cometh ?
His flaring beams , me , goddess , bring
I shall feel my own lips tremble
Scattering the dust of ages ,
They can restore youth to the withered frame .
Sprung from thy cradle fragrant flowers shall spread ,
To his brandimart in haste the warrior goes ;
But hah ! what discord strikes my listening ear ?
Of blind occasions , when the world has come
And bask in the sunshine reflected
And angry tempests gather ;
The dewdrops lent their aid and threw
And many a scene forgot , the heart will hold
And cast the dark foundations deep ,
Swelled with new life , the darkening elm on high
But scarce was each to his slumber laid ,
Of all the souls that stand create
Wi ' music wild the woodlands rang ,
And all most reverenced most provoked the fear .
And , drowning , read its meaning , dear .
When the norsemen prepare for the fight ! "
And shame had followed long ere this ,
Meanwhile , the song grown silent at the farm ;
With beard that floats to his waist ;
Black dusk comes hard on the steps or day ,
And mingling the pure light it brings
To meet thy kiss at morning hours ?
They to our thirteen stars shall bend ;
And raise them all against the foe .
That i go on and tell you what i think
A melody which made him doubt his ears ,
It had gone nere thy bone . ’
They melt , they vanish from my eyes .
The birds will go when the fall goes ,
And give more of rest .
Intends to pass triumphant , and give laws .
She push ’d her lingering infant into life :
As above the falls she cast her eye .
His soul the knight committed to our lord ,
Our brother ’s arms the just success have found :
Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds .
That every hope , which rises and grows broad
Taking and giving radiance , and the slopes
The violet hills are lost in gloom .
And quench with wine the yet remaining fire .
The real genii of our doom may dwell --
In which the spirit still lives on !
The red stream , issuing from her azure veins ,
Such music came as in the woods
But never a fear my craft will feel .
Thy soul from mine , and left me desolate .
From north and south came flash on flash --
The moment came , disorder split the realm ;
To see what my black hen doth lay .
So are ye welcome , sages ; thus i feel
Can blot the star that shines on paris now .
I come of a high race .
I cherish his because in me it bides :
" not as man should he be reckoned
And slumber owned its magic power --
Nor day nor night could i find rest ,
But now the last despair surrounds our host ;
That keep the names , that keep the bones ,
On the errors it forgives ;
Unchangeable . it must go .
And view how wealth , when properly applied ,
And soon the sheaves lay piled around ,
And their spirits hither bring me ;
And workhouse prisons raised upon the site .
The fatal day was come ; the priests prepare
A voice rang through the house of sleep ,
Or dart destroying in the forked glare ,
The whisper trembling in the wind :
The trivial cause , or sentence justly given ;
They gave him credit for cunning and skill ,
And drew you to this hive of rosy bloom ?
To a life compact witnessed by the sky ,
So many a happy day they spent ,
To beat the woods and hunt the game .
A great host followed him , in battle skilled ,
Within their garden set their academe : --
And leads into day again , -- its priestliness
For iron winter held her firm ;
There comes a happy pause , for human strength
Or as summer flowers fanned
Love gives it energy , love gave it birth .
On waves that battling beat and break with might ,
And prophesies of things to come .
Or make one mourner weep the less ?
Ere nation follows nation to their thrall ;
Beating the walls of a mute despair .
Were caught within the record of her wrongs ,
Yet the thought comes thrilling through all my pain :
So tangled in its custom 'd toils that smile
While my father lay in his mortal illness .
Till her end should come ; )
To light the fire of poesy .
The weeds that grow where once corn stood alive ,
Thou bindest up the broken heart ,
Which sees itself beginning in the seeds ,
He passed the stages of his age and youth
For this merry jest thou hast shown unto me ;
And the spell is about us spun !
The choice we make , or justify it made ;
The sad reality comes o'er my mind .
Where the kemps carouse were keeping ,
Almost that passage had made morning there
Or on the beach making thy lonely range ,
Where at her feet kept ward upon the bank
In each bright bud , a slumbering silence lies .
Catch rays of sunshine from them as we meet ,
And with their love would have enfolded him .
And thee . a pleasant sight the morning showed ;
No later light has lighten 'd up my heaven ,
God keeps an open house for you .
While crowds to show him honour strove .
The tortured copse bends to and fro
And swept away the foeman 's ranks
The moon when daylight drops away ,
Together bound by peaceful joy --
Columbus found th ' american to girt
God gave thee jurisdiction of thy soul .
The glorious saint this answer made :
The time has come when brothers must fight
At others ' misery moan ,
The little child , she shed
And raspberries the sun hath kissed .
Until his soul was filled with ecstacy .
O'er my heart will loose with kisses
That tarnished held but so the more
Pleasures above , for tortures felt below :
And lightning from its small eyes poured ;
Whose sharp declivity shoots off secure
Shake him when storms make mountains of their plains -
With downcast eyes , their silent grief express 'd ;
Her pulse plays fast and feeble .
And here the commune stretched a barricade ,
The kiss that through his quivering lips she met .
There should oblivion stop the heaving sigh ,
Youth still beckons everywhere .
Which make to flash these colours of the flame .
And wraps the woods in a purple haze ;
Triumphal arch , that fill ' st the sky
Among the children of illusion went :
That hath kept watch o'er man 's mortality ;
The living virtue now had shone approved ,
How all our copper had gone for his service !
Downcast , through the garden goes :
And let na the sea come in . "
And free will is subdued by appetite .
Or turn to nourishment digested well .
The summer knows and suffers it ;
His golden locks time hath to silver turned ;
Love is the fuel which maintains the fire .
About its mother 's heart , and brought
Moulded the court 's high atmosphere to breathe ,
Our bud of beauty grew ;
From early spring till frost comes in the fall
That filled the field scarce brought him to confess
Those lines that i before have writ do lie ,
Through dusty time its rose will draw men on ,
Nor made atonement when he did amiss ,
Cradled , is borne on the crest of emotion ,
His sad faint words addressed the queen :
Where their hid treasures lie ;
Could we retrace the fifty years gone by —
Where ordered bands their station kept ,
Ceasing a while from utterance of doom ,
An oar my hand must bear ; a shepherd eyes
Damsel , that none whom fame can show
But made the law and kept it , --
Advice is sporting while infection breeds :
She fell away in her first ages spring ,
And in their eyes and faces read his doom ;
Hung over him , the valley lay beneath ,
Sung by some knight in days gone overlong ,
As the springs to meet the sunshine ,
I saw his wisdom infinite ,
Had given aeronauts the slip .
And straight their flames with tenfold fierceness burn :
The word they shall perforce let stand ,
The truth prevailed , and with disgrace
From words there can be no iota taken .
Was quite made up by warm affection 's glow .
' soon gave the flocks a different appearance , --
To call to heart a peace for ever flown .
Where all the riches lie , that she
The glorious pomp he found ,
But brings with it eternall punishment ,
Are you feeling well this morning ?
The threshold steals into the palace-court ,
Such dread his awful visage on them cast .
Thy blast of judgment fills with fires of death .
The golden eve its lustre poured ,
And lay a way of dew and flowers
My soul would take wings with tee ;
The rest mad fortune gives or takes away :
A restless shadow through the chamber waving :
For this our banner holds the sky :
Feet in the jungle that leave no mark !
And compassing the warrior , form a round .
Do go merrily on ,
That will take him ' to his slumber ,
All , all , the present evil teach ,
Whose radiant morning soul did give thee birth ,
A little thing to flatter and make weep ,
And every picket went straight up and down ,
And bearing it all for the love of them .
Brand , burn up , bite into its grace --
For game they joyous issued forth ,
Our father has mended the bathroom door
The purple coppice hang with blaze ;
Rally the legions and lead them home ,
And the old man that spoke before went on ,
Are bound in slavery 's fetters still :
The glimmering winds bring fragrance from afar .
So maggie runs , the witches follow ,
Let the hands of ukko follow ,
To pass into that rest , whence sounds so sweet
There he found work that did a day employ ,
And early autumn brought the day
And the wicked ones who follow ;
How oft we find when sickness brings distress ,
Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark ,
You stick to rules your grandma ' ranged ,
" and my millenium brings them home ,
Each hour was equal to the charge it brought .
Now mingling peace with strife ,
The chill night-blast to feel ,
What sudden ecstasy of joy is flowing !
To win her charms .
Of those who felt its loathsome breath ,
Fresh fuel adds , and stirs the boiling pot .
Where truth we find through musing 's fitful dream :
Has never flowed in vain .
And in my hand a forest lies asleep .
Safe be the highway where their feet may go ;
I felt as she danced the last set ;
Fitful , gloomy , piercing cold ;
But the dame felt depressed
In eden that float .
And merlin locked his hand in hers and said ,
Where are the wailing voices that should meet
Soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind :
More azure than before to spread above thee .
To set in the great new temple of my god
It tossed its head at the wooing breeze ;
A country to take and to keep ;
Where cringing groans once rose unsummed ,
As the leaves that float in their idle play ,
Still from one sorrow to another thrown :
Virtue could see to do what virtue would
There came a voice from the realm of thought ,
With the muses to take refuge .
Shall take again my soul when done with earth ,
That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel ;
And not a mask went unimproved away :
" ring out false pride in place and blood ,
Long held the limits of the paths of men :
That keeps my love to her sae warm ,
But waits that all his love may feel ,
And nature gladly gave them place ,
Ye never stood with us ' neath summer skies ,
Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill .
Your statements usually hold more or less .
Even on the knot a narrow rift is made ,
The cross of truth to bear ,
If e'er thy breast with freedom glowed ,
He found himself alone , and friends retiring .
It was because a woful dread possessed .
The red sap to carry upwards to the sun .
His early life had given the best ;
Slew polydorus , and his wealth possessed .
You see each grief is noted ;
And weary , from the pyre a space withdrawn ,
And death must dig the level where these agree .
It feels the breath of spring , and every may
The breach he makes no wisdom can repair :
The claims you fiercely won are lost and sold ;
Against the poets their own arms they turned ,
What rocks and shelves , and sands lay round
Only my heart , only my heart responds .
Lips that fashioned hell or bliss , --
I sped to thee for whom i feel ,
Out on the hills the scarlet maples shone --
The swelling teats . with admiration struck ,
A quickening rhythm showed he plied the spur .
Bring forth the roll of fame ,
Truths which , from action 's paths retired ,
' sometimes with wishes mingles tears ;
If he would give consent .
Now again he hunts the lost-words ,
That of the forest , every fan they broke .
And the state of his soul with questions tried ;
But ah , the evil days come round !
The white moon hang like a breast revealed
A candles glimmering , if it come but nie ,
And on the low far sea the clouds collected .
Pierced his heart , and he fell lifeless .
And sunshine tipped the pointed roofs with gold .
What happy man to equal glories bring ?
For the poor make no new friends ,
With eager speed the well-known journey took ,
Smiling , i made reply . _
The star that ruled my birthday hath betrayed me ,
From him his restless charger broke astray ,
The foul cause hinted in the vile surmise ,
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
But if she scorn the guilt that mars --
Sacred to love this spot shall ever stand
And there on a reef we come to grief ,
And his lips moved , " poor loving fool !
She set her mark upon that throng ...
And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth
Ere the very last of the night was spent .
Now dabbles in the crystal wave , to chase
Must loveliness find root within decay ,
And from the hermit ’s presence went .
And that the heart of italy must beat ,
" and why gives this the only prime
At once made heaven and earth with darkness blind ,
As old time makes these decay ,
She took the tried clay of the common road --
Full weight must be transferred upon my head .
And what his storms have blasted and defaced
And great achilles shine again in arms .
The silver waters that lay mute ,
He in the monster 's eyes the radiance throws ,
Short respite ; it is all that war allows .
Falling through pride , yet keeping pride ,
Till the king to milo gave his sign ,
Is raised on high . -- no pagan but adores
Love , in you , went passing by ,
But how reverently does he touch this mysterious subject !
And where shall mother 's bosom find ,
That lay before me in that mystic gaze .
Though placed in paradise , for earth has still
Such mixture was not held a stain )
Or as the rose that takes no care
Which in each brother 's history reads its own .
To us some sorrow brings .
An outrage offered to his majesty , )
But i will beat my wings above the pitch ;
Or taunt morose , but if it ever chanced ,
Shuddering because that evil thing had passed .
And the line of the woods go reeling black ,
And filling it with such wild dreams ,
Flirtations budding , coming into flower ;
Had not a poor old cobbler chanced upon him ,
Business has been going on here .
There came a bitter cry
A power that held the ways --
And leave thy funeral rites to me ?
It makes me stronger as she prays --
Softly stealing over land and sea ,
His grand event was when the barn took fire ,
Till sorrow 's voice shall catch the tone
And from their lids a thrill was sent ,
And my heart worked at them unduly .
The lonely lilies rise ;
What his skillful hands have fashioned .
To the wisdom told to him .
The gleam of rapture from her visage flies ,
To cure the wound because you made the sore .
All must run the christian race .
His helping hand , his brother to sustain .
Of the wind as it passes !
And mine eyes are blurred with tears ,
Then came rare recollection , with a mouth
When sweet loss stood nearest ?
Or fool my liberty away .
Gabriel , and michael , and him who made
And frequent round him rolls his sullen eyes ,
But what could all their art attain ? --
Comes the sound of children , singing ,
And as often he found the devil to pay ;
But at the last her beaten blood drew back
Let foolish tears no more be shed ,
No sign our gladness shook ;
Give the vengeance due
In night and dew to lie upon the mountains ;
The thirteenth trump you went and played
Who would have sunk without her friendly aid .
It silently ran by .
O tender time that love thinks long to see ,
And let the sound thereof ascend to heaven .
And voices in her rising storm ;
Turn thy tears to weeping joy .
And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied .
Believe love speaks it not , but lust ;
Was sweet with songs celestial , came a prayer
By truth unharmed our houses stand ;
And then his form to earth they cast ,
A strength to bear thy matchless misery :
Like to a stream that gains or loses breath ;
As one might think a star that heavenward led .
The primrose for a veil had spread
Until the autumn comes , old age enthrals ,
And showed the seasons of the sliding year ?
Upon the plains a thousand towns arise ,
The maidens ' doors of life lead out
What food our spirits feed on . palestine
His quizzical , grey eyes can somehow mark
It bears our commerce to the sea ,
And led the soul along a way of tears ,
Life strangely out of death renewing ;
But all transfigured with angelic light !
With fixed deposits always go .
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
This was an awkward test , as juan found ,
Marvel it is , god stays so tolerant .
Still quivering , with her senses dazed ,
And squeezes out the lifeblood of the vine .
And thy relenting heart would kindly warm .
Pensive she plied the melancholy loom ;
In saying this i feel that i rejoice .
What presses now , and what shall follow after :
Had often touched the soul of eginhard .
And no proud honour to thyself redounds .
Wrung from a spirit seldom eased by tears .
Of life shall bear you from the strange worlds over
O thou ! who pour 'd the patriotic tide ,
How tenderly the twilights fell !
May the day that gave christ birth
To keep that day along her shore ,
Little cares , nor feels disheartened ,
I follow , follow : is it she ?
Spake to her the words that follow :
He saw ten thousand living authors pass ,
As if they sought but saw no mercy there ;
Thy husband , him to follow thou art bound ;
The dark cave 's portal gliding by ,
He felt that soul-sustaining evidence ,
That i took from the glorious temple of god
That providence takes us in tow :
And lose my desolation there ,
Have changed the kingdom found !
And when at last he lost his breath ,
And where the treasures of his empire lay ;
On truth and justice shall be laid ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
_ how to look when speaking _
A proper chalice made to hold the shy
You then whose judgment the right course would steer ,
But that he caught the age 's malady ,
Then by countless stars is followed ;
The broad stream bore her far away ,
And the steady wind blew yet more cool ;
From brian 's hand the symbol took :
Which anger fain had made more hard than stone .
Of perfume shall fling up into the air ,
And that he bore in his hot flight
Hope hath not lost her ray !
Who made it holy for his use alone .
Not to feel sickness or remorse of murder .
One word that might leave satisfied his lip --
Do you see any signs of my giving in ?
And there they laid their dead to sleep
Of passion than prayer ever breathed . by the power
Have all the hopes of ages come to naught ?
Seemed only the dream echo faint and sweet
And each flickers , still attempting to escape .
By faith alone our march we kept .
And daily strifes arise , and angry words .
And , fronting his lonely home ,
Each evening sees it fall .
Peace lost , heart withered , feeling dead ?
In fields where roses fade .
And sadly given to the mortal sin
Whenever his wages would fall due ! --
" these are no longer real tears which rise ,
And thoughts of this has since oft made him weep
What strange faces of dreams , voices that called ,
Years passed , and in earliest youth i knelt
Their freedom only can restrain ,
To catch again the glory shed ,
That measured five cubits between hoof and horn .
Oh , children take long to grow !
The train came early in to-night ,
Love wrought such things as bred my smart ,
That a tender dream of her face may rise
But a trouble weigh 'd upon her
Her sun of life had set in gloom --
Them from the northern winds . ere comes the light
The winter sun has stored his rays ,
No earthly power could break asunder
In lurid gleams of crimson broke ;
By the lonely , sighing sea ,
Young romance raised his dreamy eyes ,
Chimera there spues fire and brimstone out ,
The damned ship lurched and slithered . quiet and quick
Soon to the grave descends each honoured name
And slain with laughter rolled the gilded squire .
And discord raging bathes the purple plain ;
Of those long vigils and the tears that fell
That checks me with its memories , drawing near :
My heart thrilled with pleasure so keen it was pain
Now man can not rest in his pleasure and toil
Through life 's pitfalls safely trod .
Whose faithful soul regards the right ,
And to the avenging sea which whelmed the foe
That the great trees made .
Angry grew and sighed for vengeance ;
Still troubled by the god who reigned within ,
The charm he wears within ,
The haschish of the west , which makes
A car triumphal : on two wheels it came
Release their souls from anguish dark ,
Cast their fortunes in the balance ,
Its memory lives in music 's breath .
And here with heart intrepid meets his fate ;
I say again -- to his defence take heed .
And moves her pity with his tears .
Above all stateliest men which followed him .
Hoping thereby to make amends
And that , with growing ecstacy ,
On freedom 's lightly soaring arches
" ' taste the food that stands before you :
Of red sea winds , a prodigy was cast .
Midnight goes , but he watches still
The myrtles leaned to read and read .
But if the soul be made an auction mart ,
His cherub soul has passed to its eclipse ,
To raise a _ pious riot _ there .
Torches pale to extinction ?
Only by the warmth that comes
Had , sinking , left me overwhelmed with night .
As lovers fall into a swoon :
Ship money charles raises the ship money tax ;
That treads its circle in the night !
And i shall meet good days and mirth ,
A presence nigh , betrayed by shadows thrown
But by the shadow o'er our fortunes thrown ;
Of a thousand songs swept on and on ,
Whose wealth brings want , whose want increase ;
To compass great estates , and get the sway .
The man was moved , and silence fell again ;
High in the crystal brimmers flowed ,
The only throb she gives
Baring truth 's face , and letting drift
He gave one last , one bitter groan --
Shall find occasion just to blame thy speech
He looked , nor sought her wistful , downcast eyes
She blushed ; and blushing plunged into the wave .
That sees through tears the mummers leap ,
Or mark the rolling year ?
" shall we give ourselves to singing ,
That fell from baby eyes of blue ;
That aims to trace the secrets of the skies :
Low in the dust see regal splendour laid :
His hot flushed cheeks , or lifted wantonly
Dragged it so far , he made of that alone
Friendship or love draws freshly forth .
That for his goodness bore his child good will ,
And on your form and features leave a blight ;
Rain has washed the evening blue .
With the white charmed ships sliding through .
So many and so various laws are given ;
Of greatest anguish could the memory keep ;
But answer made she none .
' if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues ,
I see them raise the storm of war ,
I love my rich , and i admit
The pity that was felt for me .
My heart flies west but eastward move my feet ;
Shall wave with a glory that never shall wane .
That pride to humble and our rights restore .
And that fear makes me sad . ”
Who takes eight various forms -- was glowing there .
Till the light returned and the night grew pale ;
But the envious fortune of war delivered the austrian
And feel no emotion my bosom to swell ?
Has swept the broad heaven clear again . "
Constant they follow , where injustice flies .
The swallowing seas that tore the land
And the shadows fall longer from the high mountains .
Whatever sweets salute the northern sky
We paled with love , we shook with love ,
Away to the west as the sun went down ;
Through all its fetters now triumphant broke ,
So like a painted battle the war stood
With dye that from her lids and lashes came ,
So fear goes crawling up their hearts .
Shall gather delight from the transport of ours ;
The use of riches in discretion lies ;
Some sorrows come from evil thought , but some
If they give us a job to do .
He stores the milk that feeds the babe ,
And makes the word miltonic mean sublime ,
It chanced the lord of battles came
Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen ,
" put such ignorance into her cleverness ? "
As that which might suffice to make him sane .
The friends so linked together
Like sentries of the sky , issued the hour
I knew that my time had come . i shuddered
Wearied himself , one gave himself to ease ;
And clouds are blown and torn upon high forests ,
And the daylight into the darkness dies ,
Can pass the flight of souls adoring ,
Failed of the music that he made .
Following thy lead , illustrious atchison ,
Their songs fill with music thy sensitive ear ,
And their pent choler and their rage expose :
Sweet words and kisses came anon --
And youth comes back into the heart .
The darkness fluttered by approaching feet ,
And from my beard the fat away have swept ;
The cyclops here their heavy hammers deal ;
When , with his second bottle rallied ,
Or alma bell had made a waste of life ,
These seeds cast a film over eyes which weep .
And holds dominion o'er the body all .
Day like a tragic actor plays his role
So upon agramant this counsel wrought ,
Poured his recruited anger on kohen .
And eagerly the sun leapt up the sky ,
Which that fierce life did hold ,
From war 's inferno comes the phantom file ,
And when forgotten centuries had passed ,
The placid gods grant gifts where they belong :
Freedom 's sword will strongly draw ,
In whom the utmost signs of age appears ,
Never doubted clouds would break ,
Laughing till heaven was opened in gladness
So the quarrel arose and i went to law .
To hide the fault i see ;
But worse than that at fifty lost her mind ,
What dreams of splendour blinded us and fled !
Enquiry should be held about the thing .
And his heart outran his footsteps ;
There to yield thee to thy slumbers .
The evil by a woman wrought .
Till lost among the light that shone
Fair-haired sneezoff made his issue ,
Giving no thought to applause .
Now filtering winds thin winnow through the woods
With sweet attraction still engage ,
Flesh of rotten trees will make him . "
Time caught in meshes of eternity --
A day or two of anxious life you gain ;
To see their judgments hang upon thy voice ;
The orchards spangles hung .
But even so , my shame must still remain .
Heart and mind are wrung with grief ,
The life forth issuing with the weapon 's point .
Laugh 'd aloud with proud lips curled ,
Seems to echo the far-away calling of children
Well i perceived the venom of her meaning .
And the west wind blew most fiercely ,
That comes direct from thee .
The hushed air shivered with the throb it gave ,
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
Old friendships around it will cling .
It fell , for al his wicchecraft ,
The waves broke on the door-step ; fishermen
And soften all the hills with mist ,
The wind will blow , the dawn will glow ,
The offering earlier meant :
Again the old spirit-wind will blow
They fled in fright ; fear overtook them ;
With men and women who by want are driven
Swift as the word the vain illusion fled ,
What the words meant -- i was freed !
And centres its gaze on me ;
Patroclus , that his body might suffer no change .
Gay colts that never felt a brand
None can escape from death . say that ye come
If sighs and sorrows reach a place like this ,
And all the craggy mountains yield .
Where the great wall round china goes ,
Safely and soon they reach their destined place ,
Whence like a bee it found its cell ,
Restless it rolls , now fixed , and now anon
And wealth may lose its charm for him ,
The flowery spring leads sunny summer ,
A pilgrim down the paths that disappear
Gave him his daughter ; but when tidings came
And as the slave that is given in barter .
And to my troubles this one comfort bring ,
Homewards he bends his solitary way .
They fled to bliss or woe !
Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness .
And still the restless wind comes forth ,
Foretells the heaviest tempest , it displays
Her rosy cheek leaned on her lily hand ,
Where heart and lungs now lie .
But chilling winds around it blew ;
And drag them surely down to shame and death ?
Sweet summer ! unto you this swallow drew ,
With fuller profits lead an easier life ,
How like st. george , invincible i stand ,
To thine , which now absorbs within its sphere
Might only bring you pain ;
On the southern sky hangs heavily far and sad .
Time touched eternity that day ; --
Weareth that form , which influence of the soul
How gushed the life-blood of her brave --
Broke up , shall heave the ocean to usurp
And a world in the world man looks upon .
Where great hippotades the sceptre bore ,
And to the saint their reverence paid ,
Where the glacier 's teeth hang white ,
Missing no shot , however rashly made
To catch the diamonds gay ,
To its last loneliness must creep away .
With foolish pride my heart was never fired ,
White vapours float along the glen ,
Sweet with imprisoned ambergris and musk ;
With _ sin _ 's disease grown desperate ?
By noon , and let thy good days pass ,
When a hundred years are gone !
With threads of quivering light shot through and through .
When ocean ran swallowing shore ,
To clear those junkers out of parliament .
That wrapped his soul in peaceful avallon .
His menace will fulfil , who made his boast
His eye first glanced where euryclea spreads
That brings him home again .
And all seemed peaceful more than words could say .
This dread catastrophe soon sobered him ,
Base were the deed thy lips would teach ,
They 'd melt into tears at your smile . "
Have i not culled as sweet before :
Then lifted up her voice , and cried aloud
The times approach when men of might ,
I press to bear no haughty sway ;
Breaking the silence of the seas
They 'd pass as a dream of the night .
For his spirit with grief was stirred ,
In radiant adoration tranced ,
The land of dreams goes stretching away
When every one his eyes that way convey 'd .
It passes , and we stay :
That constance held affection to the veil ;
They carried the news to king louis .
Pale precipices frowned above the track
The blush of shame was gone as on his face
And blend amid destruction swift the latin people lost .
Till my heart flies forth at last
Were filled with it by night and day .
“ threaten 'd to spread . impatient of delay
It lay so helpless , so forlorn ,
A patriot gamester playing for a crown ,
Pushed tensely round his hips the coat tails draw ,
Mystery , half veiled and half revealed ;
She takes no part , for her soul is sick
And freed his soul the nearest way .
Strange birds called to me flashing by .
The purple mediterranean kissed the land .
He shrank not from its horror , nor withdrew
As the sunlight that plays on a stream ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
That paved his narrow cell ; and long he lay
Him will i slay , and lock his pining ghost
We extract for our readers the intelligence given ,
Of the matter made a botch ;
Who , voiced by many a worthy witness still ,
To tread the humble paths of earth .
They count on good cheer this christmas morn !
That makes your blood run cold .
A voice cries through the sunrise : " time is
Shall bring us to our goal ,
Inquired , what vision comes ? the seer replied :
Then he took the spark of fire ,
So to my eyes a sorrowful vision came
Valour is school 'd and glory is secured ,
And no heart-swelling meets god 's compelling ,
With blue wings folded o'er our dreaming sleep .
The vessel takes its mournful way ,
And fill my bosom with a sweet surprize .
To lead the pilgrim soul to beauty above :
But foreign griefs possess 'd not power to chase
The babbling waves made murmurous pause to hear :
Two dollars an acre would git the land .
Just remember -- light is coming ,
When all the god came rushing on her soul .
And he would call the fleeting year to stay .
Breaking the clouds where it was nurst ,
Whose twilight goes before approaching day .
I laid a love that was dead or dying ,
Can spring from mutual slaughter ! lo , i hate
Which formed her nature set a thought on kings ,
That stayed the soul from unity
Turning to scorn with lips divine
The nefas power was washed away ;
But by the gods was this destruction brought .
( i laughed like the dead who feel the thaw
Here sickness can not enter nor old age ,
Oh , when shall i the country see ,
Ejected , to make room for -- human earth ;
Where wanton zephyrs blew them .
Passing that way his benediction give .
Of mystery . dream after dream went by ,
Sufficient strength to draw the mighty bow ?
Yet the great knight in his mid-sickness made
Till tossed on fortune 's faithless sea ,
Shown resentment at the outrage .
This side the woodland we have reached ;
Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed
Then come fair fragrant dreams as though
Belinda now , whom thirst of fame invites ,
Where burdened hearts find rest in thee awhile ;
Ever the unhappy lover might survey ;
Oft morn rises brightly ,
Thus the spirits went and wandered ,
That , though my soul may never see salvation ,
Bringing their dreams home from the uncharted sea .
It leads you to the realms of peace ;
Three shillings he could make a day ,
But every dart flies past and rocks rebound
The ancient right is gone , the new remains
Hope daily weaves fresh roses for his brow ,
For sun and wind have plighted faith to her
There came dark israel ,
That cast a dusky glow upon her face .
And clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts ,
Rant oaths in voices cracked and hoarse :
Some other means shall work my heart 's desire ,
The walls and towers are warmed and gleam .
Which there meets thine ,
When change itself can give no more ,
And time drew near when he again must fight
When his daily course is run ,
The violets whisper from the shade ,
The music stopped and i stood still ,
For sorrow bends the stoutest soul ,
To thee my meaning will more plainly teach .
Where love has entered , death is also there .
The hovering lamps , which nod and tremble by
To which the said spectacles ought to belong .
A torrid and tortuous tempest stung
Guided by counsel from the spirit land ,
And the hall made empty now
Until they find a lustier than themselves . '
Part of the christian people should be set ,
And the little reeds sighed _ abide , abide _
Such woes as wicked kings shall feel .
Mangles , returning horrible forms .
Proved well the love he gave her ,
The channel which gave access to the sea
The coloring of romance it wore .
For something from our hearts is gone .
Such a theme as this portray ,
Which sings unendingly about his throne .
Making its sweetest , faintest breath
There came a lapse between the showers ;
Which heaven planted us to please ,
Why goest thou hurrying to the feeble shade
Where my joy may work unnoticed
Pleading , longing , brimmed with tears ...
Love 's dearest joys they never prove ,
And all distaste from frail affection takes .
A firmament reflected in a sea ;
What charm to show her beauty hides a snake ,
My meadows all take in the light and grow ;
The pressed flowers took a wondrous shape ,
And bitter envy in their hearts sprang up .
Crowned with eternal fame , they sit sublime ,
Then chance an ' fortune are sae guided ,
Give the vengeance due
All music and all silence held thereby ;
With the deluge of summer it receives ;
See , how they grapple the night as it rolls
Were centred in thy smile .
More grace than other women 's lips bestow ,
To thee alone he takes his fatal way .
That curled o'er your battle-line ;
Which makes thy casting down so great .
And lifting faces of despair .
Then all beams of longing focused
Whatever comes , let 's be content withal :
When sorrow all our heart would ask ,
And his sad voice came low and weak ,
With pain i read the words they writ
Our creed , say you , needs revising ,
Thus went that beautiful multitude , nor far ,
These charms shall work thy soul 's eternal health ,
Pointed at her in derision ,
That lit him o'er the trackless tide ;
Their lonely graves were made ;
Would they have stayed their wild , wild love ,
To pass for sterling truth in open day .
This ode is addressed to a swallow .
For there thy faithful oracles shall stand ,
Love than this which inly takes its fill ,
To those that stood in need ,
Five scimitars , wi ' murder crusted ;
That brimmed with nectar in the primal plan .
Who passed for the dead this spring ,
Of warriors rose on every hand .
With her , as years successive glide ,
And happy heart , that pays its toll
It gives no light at such sad time
When sickness pressed with healing cordials came ;
Struggles and frees itself to find the sky .
In storm and night went down .
Her breath comes quick , she battles with the storm
And only the darkness laid against my face ,
Unfurl the flaming of a thousand dreams .
My heart is on the point of cracking .
That fire is burning , still unquenched .
To blast or ban a mortal hope or faith .
The halting troop a line had made ,
Then glitters out again and sweeps the sea :
Forth ran patroclus through the camp of greece .
And join with thee calm peace , and quiet ,
A morn where summer blends wi ' spring ,
Where violets gaze upward to the sky !
With such rare doctrine as gives iron life .
Yet with an empty , white emotion stirred ,
Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire ,
To stop the chariot ; but the chariot flies .
Your company i most of all affect ,
A world for every kiss i 'd give her .
That hang low down where golden rivers run .
Still surging dark against the christian bound
Does it not go on preaching ?
Captive to thee , drawn by their own desire ,
Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove ;
The little stars sat one by one ,
And ills preparing for the sons of troy .
The land can show such front to war
From the same sunlight one draws crimson deep ,
Feel the large freedom which in faith is given ,
Here banished found they mischief-making loke
Did primitive christians ever train ?
Where prostrate error hails the rising sun ?
Where she and they that night had made abode .
Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe .
And mist blew off from teme ,
The child moans ; the hours slip
“ yet his disguise ulysses ' cunning found :
For her dear johnny 's absence made amends .
When youth and beauty made a summer morn ,
Ere long put an end to the game .
Again she yielded to despair ,
The cock awakes and spreads his wings ;
While passion still her bosom stirred .
In art or nature aught so passing sweet ,
Their meaning for the feelings gone ;
The only art her guilt to cover ,
Where many a life was brought to dust ,
He passed to evil ones ; began to stray ,
Of moonlight , creeping through the grated door ,
As courage came , we boldly faced 'em ,
For from the day the tidings reached her door
Since thou from them dost borrow scent ,
His warlike bands the holy henry leads ;
But smoke-dried strephon seeks the bliss
More often comes the word divine
As for grief to be taken aback ;
The melancholy waters lie .
Three old hermits took the air
But with the boon a task is given :
Involving both , convey 'd them safe away .
That spread a wilderness indeed ;
What ' comes of all the birds
Where in his blood full many a hero lay .
To man she gave the flame refined ,
The deathblow was , dealt silently
And rise like miracles among the flowers .
That also with them goes material for thinking !
In sun-bright chariots led the way .
Pompeius fled , his mighty soul prepared
Upon her cheek the color went and came
That night we felt our love would hold ,
So through the hush his hissing murmur stole --
Text follows the edition of 1809 .
It swung into its azure roads again ;
Shall make thy actions with their ends to meet .
She holds her way , and i look with joy
There lies no shadow of a sin :
Some message did the winds deliver
In briefest time shall meet his fate .
Not fancy 's hand should join my courtly lip
Down fell the duke , his joints dissolved asunder ,
Then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain ,
And chased the clouds and brought the sun again .
Of happiness it seemed to promise him ,
Their deaths indeed might well demand our tears :
Which writ and folded with the nicest art ,
He found what oft the generous bosom seeks ,
To rise and take our liberty .
Those radiant structures raised by labouring gods ,
To make the cretans bloodier in battle .
And downward shattered to the pavement flung them .
And through the mist there goes a cry ,
His limbs relaxed , and sleep possessed his frame .
And jaws that gape with pestilential death .
But tidings of summer the young roses bring .
I see the promise of the years --
The chains the state has bound on him !
And golden boxes they took their snuff in ;
Would bring soft reminiscence in its trail
What a trust for a mortal to hold !
By drying up our joy in everything ,
That i had but been playing with his love ,
Yet fear itself soon drew me with quick breath
In dreams of rapture i have seen thee pass
And sweet will shakespeare long ago is gone !
Blow wide the buds , which night has swelled ?
Which scattered within your pate may stray ;
Save terrors still more awful than before ;
Their sons , they gave , their immortality .
And sixty feet the fountain leapt .
" fear doth at every portal knock ;
Of protestant plymouth held his memory long ;
But angels come to lead frail minds to rest
But for all that 's gone and come ,
These valiant stories of the world to come ?
For meat , shall give thee melody .
From the first fiddle , set her trembling .
The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud ,
My beauty , which the loftier it climbs ,
You gather from the scenes of strife and death --
Truth must purchase truth .
And is devotion thought too much on earth ,
Is cause of half the poverty we feel ,
Upon her perfect cheek was shed ,
On the soft passion , and the taste refined ,
That obvious science asks small learning 's aid .
The road winds onward white and long ,
Which to this mystery belong ,
Has broke the bond of dying use . "
It hides the scars with almost human hands .
I have buried grief and sorrow
Beyond my pale i know not where they go .
The stubborn oaks and forests dance around .
Their bodies three on biers they set ,
Maple , the head made thick and sharply whirled .
Give me the merle 's mellow note ,
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran ,
Yet no watch the rest will keep ,
Scarce his voice ventured , low and weak ,
Can circumvent or hinder or control
The lotus-leaves which heal the wounds of death
Have spent their earnings in festivity ,
And yielded towns were set aflame ;
And frightened waves rush wildly back
Making new year 's calls .
But you who seek to give and merit fame ,
A laugh that came horribly hopping o'er us
You give fine sketch of bird and fowl ,
It gave a commission to kill one another .
Light misdirected ever leads astray ;
Which the whole girth of god secures .
The plague that none can stay .
Wildly the breakers rolled ,
And now another spring makes green the meadows ,
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
The awful fight raged fiercer yet .
Prosperity more searching of the mind :
And veiled his wrath in scornful word :
Thus ráma showed his love the rill
And here i 'll stand to test my power ,
They follow their uniform march forlorn ;
The dull dusk fills with rain ;
Thither at once my heart would fly .
One sigh of all the mystery in thee found .
But no sunlight may soften that soulless stare .
And deemed the stag must turn to bay ,
But time which none can bind ,
The more be to appease her anger sought ,
Fruits on the woodland branches lay ,
One day a stir was made that street within ,
With pen dipped in the golden sun ,
And istar 's music moved your mouth
His clouded eye confessed his fear ;
And ours makes answer o'er the snow .
The bents and braes give ear ;
I bring not runes nor charms , but bending lowly
It comes on the 11th of october !
And find naught but pride and scorn ;
Merely to show your worth ,
The gift of song is given ,
How lightly all the angels went ,
My soul , disdainful and disgusted , sought
Which , like the plants that throw
Through this dread shape the suffering ages look ;
And annals graved in characters of flame .
His gory chest unveils life 's panting source ;
The little one when slumber wrought ,
To settle her annuity .
To stir the scandal with a suit at law .
And the saft breeze shall bring ,
Whilst nature 's beauteous spirit fled away
Dead days that have gone before .
Did the truth at once disclose .
What sighs are born of deep enraptured joy !
Being enamoured of a damask rose
The light bestowed by heaven ; nor freshly shines
And those they loved their steps shall tread ,
Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her ,
Seems but to make the dimness darker yet ;
Disgrace once mounted , clings beside ;
In its own fashion , the sharp point it moved
And show its vileness by a holiness .
The sifted golden sun comes to us blue
And whisper saft the tender tale ,
They swooped down to take a dive ,
As closely following as the running thread
Happy if sorrow for ever may pass her by .
That quaintly crowns your graceful head ,
Through him the gale of life blew high ;
That he to power makes way by arms ,
Rolled to meet a common fate ;
From what once lovely lip it springs unseen !
And shot from crooked lips a haggard smile .
Joy from her bosom quickly fled .
By thy opinion , which makes certain to me ,
If ' chance , by lonely contemplation led ,
Shielded by faith , with truth begirt ,
So far remote , with diminution seen ,
The big drops hang on purple dates ;
In a garden where the whitethorn spreads her leaves
It speaks of peace that comes after strife ,
Thy presence here should stern atrides see ,
And as such i am bound to respect you ;
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway ,
And mary 's left to sigh .
How happy the scenes from which thou art driven !
Those he approves that ply the trade ,
And winter 's gloomy form impends ,
And to drive terror from my mind ,
Wherever fruits of christian love are found
Toil only gives the soul to shine ,
That love thus shoots , and firmly roots
But that success attends him ; if mishap ,
Vain thine efforts — all thy treasures wasting !
That loomed along the rim where day had gone .
The moving things that bring decay
But splendid -- as he mostly saw himself .
And large the heart that did his child restore .
That follow their footsteps as they dance
Whisper their faded vows
Can toil be severe which a smile can repay ?
How his strong engines he might aptly frame ,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
The fulness of the dawn is given !
Mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips .
On high designs the wakeful hours employ ;
That virtue walks ashamed , with downcast head ,
Lest they should break the compact they had made .
Casts her errors on the waters .
And even home scenes failed to make him glad .
And this shall raise thy glory high . ”
And so they made report that all the dreams
The name lord god chooses to go by , made
Those limbs upon that cold earth laid ,
And pity with just vengeance joined ;
The poor in spirit felt a friend was near .
Nor taking heed of either man or beast ,
Without getting kicked -- we knew each other .
Gives precious bitterness to the wind ;
That in the sun did rivulets run ,
We watched the trailing seasons loiter by ,
Our mercy shall be shown .
What holds your fields with harvests full ,
In vain believers flash devotion 's fire ,
That lifted his brown hair . with lingering gaze
But sadness on the soul of ida fell ,
_ on first looking into chapman 's homer _
Of miserable life shall soon be spent ,
Time passed : forgot james taylor and his shame --
On the crests that flash by .
And from her lips unwitting came a moan ,
" on facts well ascertained which insight brings ,
Flowers and stars take for thy alphabet .
I give the first watch of the night
The dust-stained wanderer finds ease .
While the sign of battle flew
From her hands the fire dropped downward
She flashed around one fearful glance --
They spare each consecrated bower .
What but that self to man doth nature teach ?
Noisily autumn , makes a sense of peace
When better blood gave vigour , nor the snow
And feebly flickered into rest !
Then broke the silence of those saints concordant
No lustre lost that life had given ;
And gives her empire to his dread command ,
Since god left her radiance here --
The iron shall cease , the golden race arise ,
You wives and maids give ear-o !
To welcome life , and die a living death ;
Flowers with deeper beauties shine ;
Which lapped his battle-tireless limbs . but still
And stirred each generous heart to flame .
That lies unstirred at summer 's heart ;
Yet blinds our eyes with never lifting shade .
Like his , shall speak of peace ! "
At early morn swept daisy dare , --
To call to mind his former cheats ,
Of lonely lives shall read their type in thine :
The watches kept ;
Love lit a beacon in thine eyes ,
That nature has given the lovely young man :
The ploughman from the sun his season takes ;
' twill chase that pensive tear ;
Had common things to do and bear ,
That cradled in their folds the infant dawn .
The stars already near to bring the time ,
The ring that bound him to her spell ?
Love with us goes wandering still ,
Whose presence makes me feel that i am bound ,
Which milton held . -- in everything we are sprung
What general had not feared at such revolt ?
From whence all nations draw the streams of gain .
Like dark sea-tides flooding an empty cave .
But seeing draghignazzo also took
Who could each several warrior 's name declare ,
His mighty club no longer beat
Its frightening description worn ;
When the cool wind came freshly from the hills ;
Britain , that pays her patriots with her spoils ?
What this implies rinaldo makes demand :
To other points attention drew .
No warning there her sister 's spirit gave ,
An anarchist would fight . upon the whole ,
For now the watch comes round to me . "
With tears whose course no effort could confine ,
And all that mighty heart is lying still !
Who turnus ' younger sister took to wife .
Wherein no bubble tells its humble source ;
Streams have run back at murmurs of her tongue ,
I find the smiling features of
What one short sigh so easily removed ? --
And i have winged it with desire ,
The joy that is wrapped in that youngster small ?
Ask god who knows . for frequent tears have run
Old and haggard and worn with pain ;
They rattled ' round , the sights to see ,
Shot the gleam of a saw with bristling teeth .
Curly gold locks cover foolish brains ,
In answer set ? what agency doth this ? "
And altars blaze with consecrated fires ;
Decay crept in , unquickening the mass , --
I tread on the pride of greece and rome ;
And windy capes that tried their slender spars ,
And sweeping all his theories to naught :
Well may the nations say that christ is born .
Firm peace recover 'd soon and wonted calm ;
Our pulses beat together , and our beings
Where god meets hearts with gentlest grace ?
To bear with , nay encourage , truth .
A theme that might an angel 's tongue employ ;
Of arts is assembled in you , --
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given ,
But one charm remains behind ,
And it is given thee to rejoice :
Feel warm enough to raise the sap , which plays
On the wide lawn the snow lay deep ,
" whence is this arrogance within you couched ?
For every clerk anon right held with other ;
Thus higher shall my kingdom / stand in majesty .
There sits quiescent on the floods that show
And seeing it , thou strugglest painfully ,
To veil a joy too sacred to be seen .
Three times round has the sun gone , jean ,
My heart is wasted with my woe ,
And add the weapon , deftly planned ,
To see _ her _ happy -- to reflect
Than serpent 's sting produce more deadly throes .
The night wears on : -- my thirst i quench
But the wine of god came down ,
Open the life unto the good .
When suffering rent my weary heart ,
And silence held the scene ;
So by your art you spring up in two noons
That a glance at his face made you heated .
When the storm has ceased to blow !
And the notes of pleasure follow .
War wins the looks which love would fain engage .
Like wintry clouds in masses roll 'd ,
I fetched a lusty tone ,
To break the peace or hatch a plot ;
" ah , bring swift compensation to my wish ,
And let me add , when reasons of the state
And the choice is cast within ,
My heart with hopeless love to pieces tore ,
Suddenly opened on some desolate place
Blows off the filth that hid the deeper sky ;
His glory hides . the victory won ,
To aid the new , romantic notion ,
And break the deep and dreamless rest .
And it with pity i regard .
To paint the sombre woes that held us then ,
And make our hearts resolved to all assays ,
And he gave them laws to obey ;
Quick the fearful pain departed .
Had made them sever from the living stock ,
For peace to flow wider than war can wound
Than to trace figures in the fire ! "
And my heart stood still to hear .
Such a strain as i can give .
What charm is seen through europe 's realms of strife
The walls fell back , night was aflower ,
Unworthy god , be by us shared ,
For how i give me chest a throw ,
Had not my verse extoll 'd thy name ,
So free and liberal as thy bounty flows ,
My homeward thoughts must sail alone .
So that her stifled fury she may vent :
Let not his treaty be so quickly closed
Of reeling ship with downward wrath is driven .
Which sought a passage through the leaves to find .
Fastidious , finical ones , we see ;
And his mortal anguish on him came .
Of common likings , which make some deplore
Where the river watered soil
Nature feels the touch of noon ;
That should wage war on those who are baptized ;
Nor time hath changed his hair to white ,
The writing must be letters maim 'd , that speak
That nature for her happiest children made :
't is there i come to laughing eyes
Know that my blessing lay in your forsaking .
And by thy presence purge the war of guilt ?
That makes for wedded bliss , my dear .
The sun went down , the full moon rose ,
Since as the oath was made so must i swing
And straight the sun was flecked with bars ,
Their own assuageless wings they give
And strangely stirred him . on the mantle stood
Only in legends dim are they remembered ,
By the day that gives glad light ;
That mocks the tear it forced to flow ;
The shade of bushes makes a shy retreat ?
Only three things leave behind thee :
Below , the woods bathe dewy in the june .
But when my summer days are gone ,
For very fear had made them pitiless ;
And fading-time does show
Now what a different aspect things assume ;
Let all wise husbands hence example take ;
The feather finds a wing to flye
' mid sweet interpositions moves along
What dream had filled her spirit
Words unkind were heaped upon me ,
Now backward i must set my sail , and ponder
And frequently has dropped a silent tear
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim ;
Like a toy balloon and softly bursted ,
Hath fallen wearied , where her beauty fills ,
Fury and scorn gradasso 's visage heats ,
In which all heavenly treasures locked are .
There comes the good lord president ,
Soft answers duly whispered to each soothing prayer .
That with their joyful shout should close
That you had let things pass , serene
We know thou art a teacher come from god ,
Onward ever time is passing ;
Which in my youth with happier hands i wove :
Sharply shot forth showers of arrows ,
The triumph grasped , and freedom won ,
Tale of such deep horror never met his ear .
Absence doth join and time doth settle .
His daily prayers for our souls to tell . "
We break the ox , and wear away the strength
And little is left to say ,
That merciless fell like tomahawks to work ,
Howe'er the shadows went and came ,
Seeking her that he may lay hands on her ;
Of midnight . then i wrought magnetic force
Remembered in their chant , i find .
And riddle what their prattling eyes would say .
To scale the highest heaven . huge as these
Slowly the shadows gather and fall ,
Till my love should come to shore .
Were filled with good english cheer .
Filling the air with monotone of woe :
The sun ascends , new warmth he gives ,
Up to the moon is cast --
But for all that 's gone and come ,
Lone sorrow came as life declined , and care ,
We our country 's bounds and pleasant pastures relinquish ,
And his heart bounded to the joyous tone .
That made his pathway through heaven bright ;
The next few years great strides are made ;
From the river rose a monster ,
Where both the tropics pour the burning day ,
Can lift to heaven an unpresumptuous eye ,
Though autumn 's mists hung cold and chill .
And rises in apocalypse :
And her intellect played but a small minor part .
The clamorous cranes go singing through the night .
Here pilgrims meet their travels to relate ,
A favourite virgin 's blooming form she took ,
Nor could his heart its woe contain .
The whistle blew before he reached the line ;
The french around . this sermon to them speaks :
Can you see where the future lies ?
All selfish thoughts were merged in one wild fear
" she is , " came struggling from his throat
Blue is the ocean , with a flashing breeze .
To you all the tyrants of europe shall bend
We may see how all things are
The sun and wind that joined to cool and heat
And many a lip the sob suppressed ,
And thought to noble issues led .
A look of pity hither cast ,
And on the highway lay , to show it
Arm , ere our vessels catch the spreading flame ;
Our eyes were drawn together , and the hue
A worldly heart within his frame made new ,
Mountains stretch 'd around ,
Gay , scanty finery to show , }
Thither brought by nine enchanters .
Where jealous monarchies might see ,
Waits for the holy hands that took
And lifted up her voice and wept .
So fatally the flying weapon sped ,
For they their occupation meant to change ,
Chill came the tempest 's lower ;
Your hands in which my whole happiness is hidden ,
Now my mind is filled with sorrow ,
Methinks he hid this sweet love favor
Their royal line excluding from the throne :
There shines i know not what of the divine ,
To give full ardour to the song combine ;
With goddess-like demeanour forth she went ;
Were all the bands that held his muscles drawn
And filled me with thy joy .
Answered in the words which follow :
To do without what blood remained these wounds .
The future brings us more , but never all .
And flying warriors , shake the solemn floors ;
First blew her away right out of the sky --
The way of hate that led to love .
And sharper than a nettle found its flock .
And a life that makes no noise ;
Lest its former powers shall weaken ;
A thousand thousand years have gone ,
And melts the clouds to gentle show ' rs .
I grant the boons which mortals seek . ”
And boldly rising for britannia 's laws ,
That lifts his tossing mane .
And reckon up what may be left of worth
The winds and waters breathe of love ,
Where i had hoped to come on paradise ,
When thine own glories shine !
Scarce stole a breeze to wave the leafy spray ,
I love ' neath the green boughs to lie ;
His way directed where the ancient led .
Rich is my house , its cellars heaped with store
All broke our vows , myself among the rest .
Great joy her hopeful spirit stirred
The lady her handmaid to questioning took :
From youthful follies , and his mind was turned
Take the leap that springs the need .
So cowards are courageous made through need .
The castle 's bound
The moment that your vapors rise ,
" it will not go for nought . "
Leave thy troubles to the elk-herds ,
They turn to me in sorrowful thought ;
One heart alone could make reply .
In the sound his breathing kept ;
And sent soft waters murmuring by ;
From ferny hollows , where cool waters laughed
The ravenous sees no fault : his greed
Sweet , as the vernal warblings borne along
And turns his kisses on her lips to sighs ,
The nightingale at stilly night doth lay ;
In his grave no peace he finds ,
Loud wails the wind and beats the driving rain ,
My heart breaks if it cling about thee ,
While this transformed into a monster strays ;
When one grave man his silence broke ,
And , sure as the autumn season came round ,
Fled from the carnage and escaped our wrath .
That proudly sat on zion 's holy hill ,
Thou art to all lost love the best ,
Sympathy could feel and show
Still fresh and new must it arise ?
And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream .
Dull and low his fire was burning ,
Ever belongs to common , vulgar men ,
Suffering no flowers except its own to mount ?
The lips were mute that had spoken love ,
His solitary cell hard by did stand :
That merry peal comes ringing loud ;
The same red blood then coursing through my veins .
Wherof sche made his herte change ,
And great art beaten down .
Nor can drive away these evils ,
Those glaring colours laid
He takes for accidental things of trial ;
Into her private cell , when nature rests .
Thou hast found a noble suitor ,
The cruel blows of the whips reversed
My pain i could not feel .
The gems within his boot he pent .
She , dazzled by that shining world afar ,
Bill took that pain without a sound
That brims the heart of man .
That stood in knightly need .
That would make your blood run cold ;
Bright and soft its farewell gave ,
I glory in the joys i feel ,
Thy strokes , great artist , so sublime appear ,
And to thy worship bring
And pour 'd the murmurs of the wounded heart :
Some forms not marked for death returned again ;
And catch the throbbing of a song
Kings would have plunged into their red revenge
Few sounds were heard to break the stillness round ,
Whose comforts smoothed her silent bed .
It shows us we have played enough
But she in heart his priesthood shared :
To guide her with accents adoring
End in the garbage barrel -- take no heed ;
And here 's to the days that are coming ,
Whence , further , first was planted in the gods
Death finds no entrance -- pain no victims there .
The midnight hour is come on us .
Nor did i bear the melody throughout .
And the sky was filled with lightning ,
I set there an ' thought of my trouble ,
And vengeful answer poured .
We 've but to spread this mantle wide ,
The glinting snowdrifts lie ;
And cut the ropes whereon the engine rode :
And a ' folk bound to sleep ,
And with its infinite music called once more
Old memories up to make him weep and mourn .
That poor half-love so many lovers heed .
With the dim gold that lit her hair ,
Take up the burden of a mighty grief
Like a far growling lightning-cloud it leaps .
And raised her eyes to heaven . there were tears
There found the houseless a cover once more ,
Brings tears of anguish to my eyes ;
This rustic sees the seasons come and go ,
Where memory lives , a saint enshrined --
And made it thicker ; while the phantom king
Whilst tears adown her features pour ’d :
Which once flashed as freedom 's star !
No parent now remains my griefs to share ,
That tricked your taste with cards and drink ,
If you would pass the dangers of the road .
With his harsh voice screamed in terror ,
When all the strings of boyish life were stirred
But the distance did not widen
Around , around , flew each sweet sound ,
Like gleam of star upon a dying rose .
Casts all its clustering foliage to the winds ,
The news come again , so sorrowful to hear --
Short the journey that is left thee ,
No aged parent now could stay his son ;
Well hast thou motioned , well thy thoughts employed ,
Of all flowers that breathe and shine .
The mists will vanish before his smile ,
Could i sell that gift , and go without ,
When christmas holidays are come ;
And a spear yet filled with courage ,
Angry then grew wainamoinen ,
Many a jest told of the keys betraying
Make thy name a word of beauty ,
No more divided , france shall rise afresh .
Confronted the conscious pictures stare , --
So poets be they plague 'd with naughty verse ,
Here the bones of birth have cried
Till my foolish heart grow sage ;
The thought of parting shall not lie
Yet triumphs breaking ; on it rushed and streamed
These holy rites perform 'd , they took their way
Gives me the glory of his radiant smile
But such a conduct makes the sample hard ;
Still follows thee , still follows thee .
Once , in error , i entered public life ;
What wretched errors hath my heart committed ,
There came a change -- the cloud rolled off ,
Broke but the bond of love which nature makes .
Reigns that dread stillness grief alone can leave .
For the bee with its sweetness has laded
And flames fill his eyes .
That widened when she fled .
And , finding for conversion too unripe
Warm through the radiant sky their wings beat breath .
And shady woods resound with dreadfull yells ;
With low vexed song from rose to lily went ,
And the hot blood ran from the hairy throat ,
And at the darkest hour came three or four
Mid the odor of incense raised in prayer , hallowed
My trust upon him set . ”
Was born to lift the splendour of this torch
Let not your roof with echoing grief resound ,
She patted all the world ; old empires peep 'd
Men shops shall take to hold their ware ;
Nowhere appeared the art which all this wrought .
All else have cast him from their very thought ,
There shines a face i have not seen
Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
From the flush of its petals spread .
These too shall perish . where thy soul shall go
The clouds pass
He would make his choice and wed ;
The points run in , and the houses veer ,
Of wedding where my heart goes not in whole .
To shed the blood of all and to destroy ,
Answer in the words which follow :
Was lovely , fail 'd my mind to move .
Of a creature by fancy some solitude made ,
Her thanks first rendered to the courteous lord ,
Till science grew and skill ,
After which outburst , sweeping through the door ,
Of the steps that we took to one fiddle ,
What madness made thee challenge the chief knight
And shining each in his domestic sphere ,
From the hard season gaining ? time will run
It lies , yet ere conception to prevent
Already have the greenwood trees laid low
So take it right or take it wrong ,
Doth human worth mount up ; and so ordains
Where silver 'd , feathery palm-trees rise
All the beer has left the goblets ,
Around the hall flashed gold and sunlit gems ,
And the peaks looked toward god alone .
Piercing the grey skies above ,
Resolved the conflict to sustain ,
And that remaining sage , to follow her .
Who aim at perfect holiness ,
That has come to claim his bride . "
Mounting until she cowered under him .
What mystic joy i felt ! what rapt devotion !
Must go for life with broken hands unhelped .
And pulses of vague quiet went and came .
The gourd is tagged with points of fog .
To help our flagging faith to rise ,
Capt. m. ah ! i see .
My life , no arm can save ! "
Now , as the frog this sentence spoke ,
Nor comfort come to my soul widow-ed ,
Then take the sunday with you through the week ,
When will return the glory of your prime ?
But fate the word has spoken :
A hope that god had given ?
Who shares that joy with grief .
Her eyes are sapphires set in snow ,
Does he study the wants of his own dominion ?
_ but only love may lead love in _
Hid in thine heart . let all be locked within
Which uncontrolled gives such monsters birth ;
And when we grasp the bliss ideal ,
Or show the same dislike to suitors ' kisses ;
Our heart to it now replies ,
A boy once went the world around ,
Beyond the notes of revelry to pass --
Its face , with some dim date long gone .
I work so hard to make my business pay .
" the love of god lives through eternity ,
Here death has given many a horrid wound !
The wind which stirred the tasseled corn
The carousal held in secret .
To battle with cupidity and sin .
Fantastic thoughts returned ;
His breast now these now other thoughts assail ,
From whom time holds his transient lease
While his face with rapture shines ; --
As when a wild boar turns upon the hound
And the truth come tell to me , o. "
Some finer ear that , listening , bends apart .
Love shall live , although he dye .
Of error , leads them by a tune entranced .
Great fame remained ; and ere it die away
And launched afar on the calm , blue deep .
My true-love sighed for sorrow ,
His aim was not to strike a blow at rome
The woman raged to touch the flame once more ,
Sighs and songs to blend
The subject 's rights should be maintained .
He drew his daily life from these ,
And feel vague promptings to wondrous love .
Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance ;
His shrunken ashes , raise this dome : how smiles
Right to the breast-bone went the stroke ;
No slough makes him despond ;
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres ,
He pass 'd like lightning -- then ceased every sound
When his scythe has laid it low ,
His limbs are cast in beauty 's mould ,
Where god had set him in the fight ;
Is grief too great for me to bear .
All things roll on with youth , --
The injian ocean sets an ' smiles
I 'll feel the vast earth-call ;
Nor credence to the world 's cries give ,
With innocence and meditation joined
The joyous light of life is spread :
A fluttering dream driven hither and thither . --
That smile when she treads on them ;
Take the thanks of a boy .
I touched the heart that loved me as a player
But soon these boding fancies fled ;
They are the dreams that never will come true .
And vent their anger impotent and loud .
Which made the strongest man among them cower .
And autumn lingers but to outsmile the may ;
Love flies the haunts of pomp and power ,
Her , armed with sorrow sore ;
Now harks the calling squalls .
That thy voluptuous traits came glimmering through .
For death shall bring to thee no sting ,
And toiled each day till night brought such fatigue
Deep in a pit my body lay
And on the table lay the magic chart ,
In death 's kindly bosom our last hope remains --
Than if three worlds confessed thy reign .
The queen she felt so sore aggrieved
Where the soul sees hope
One way remains -- i 'll tell him all --
And caught its tone with death 's prophetic ear ;
By duty bound to forfeit each his life ,
All still in the wood ’s stillness stood ,
What harm this troop wrought to the heathen bands ,
Here cloud-like billows roared and raced :
Till all the summer flowers went by --
Bringing the perfume of half-open flowers .
Then passed the conquering northern rout ,
There comes a healing purpose in my pain
That heart that lo'ed me dearly !
The little winds are dancing with the shadows
The keenest wits shall find ;
Love the mighty power which holds them . "
That thou wilt not go lightly nigh them ,
And his infallibility be heard .
The wretch upon life ’s tempest toss ’d
The limit fixed of the eternal counsel ,
I seek the wonder at the heart of man ;
Nothing passes for thorns to hold --
And fevered terror shook his very heart .
Or carry wars to some soft asian plain ?
The lessening coursers rise in spiral rings ,
There lies no middle way or land :
While streamed the forest 's green and gold ,
Nor was perfection made for man below :
Of the great shield , wherein the lion lies
The fog of superstition had not risen ;
Where still along the sea extends their line ;
My love will come to me .
For i felt the swing and the easy stride
My thought hath built a fancy of thy form ,
And when to-day their blooms i see ,
Thence there comes the lovely sunlight ,
Sidled to gain the sunny bench of age .
Must break , and life and i must part .
The lovely images they bring thee
Skimming the waves in their frolicsome glee .
When life comes to his own again , " -
But on the next he set himself to loosen
Strengthening its wings on what has been gathered ,
The silence has not stirred ;
It will break in music , i know ,
Which added doubly to my former fear .
To destruction , led on by his magical wand .
Winona gave him generous credit , too ,
But the winter came with an angry frown ,
And sorrow 'd when i went astray ;
To leave me straight bereaved .
As if it brought the memory of pain :
" on thy brows bind silken ribands
And with the cheerful oil revive the air .
Till the stagnant blood ran free and warm .
The sap of life stirred in the dreary limb .
A thousand arguments swarm round my pen ,
Presents gave she unto all the children .
Though softly clear the mournful cadence broke ,
A tear one moment dimmed his eye .
But the saxons were keeping christmas ,
His hands obtesting , and this prayer conceived :
A paper in milwaukee gives a prize ,
These words proceeded from his mouth divine :
And chase thee hence to lowest hell againe .
The mid-day bathing followed next ,
Till this stormy night be gone ,
Until he found with laughter and with tears ,
And the earth lay calm and still ,
That cries against my wish for thee . "
A bumper and away ; for the night wears .
A river ran , conducts his holy guide .
Where best the poet framed his piece ,
Lanely nights come on ,
The golden days have come for us :
't is not enough no harshness gives offence ,
Streamed wilder power that mingled with the sound .
Reflecting how thy fame has grown
How grows serenity ? and , wanting that ,
Some found it hard to train their log
Where the compressed teeth fixed it to forced calm .
How our hearts glowed and trembled as she read ,
Till passion lent a soul to art ,
And showed the fruit and firmness it affords .
The clifts , to where the church do bide
To hush them to peace and repose ;
Ringed with that desolation , saturn stood
The winds of slavery their seed had sown ;
The earth and sky that music filled ,
As the coffin-cold wraps round
Song brings us union and leads , reconciling
But night 's faint veil now wrapped the hill ,
I feel that i am weak ,
From the dim past arose .
In the soothing thoughts that spring
Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes ,
Swinging above the church ; the road swung round .
Truth stands alone ; thy coward lie
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell ;
On the crests that flash by .
In gardens you may note amid the dearth
And oft , as evening fell ,
The papers say , but still it may be true
God gave this law to keep ,
Fighting against an end he could discern ,
Stretch out their necks to gain the post ,
And the violet 's blue would tell by its hue
That bliss may claim them for her own .
When breasting battle 's fiercest wave --
Of roses that were ripe to fall ,
To make men think the sun of honor shone
Through the sweet green grasses springing ,
Will be reduced to lists of dates and facts ,
A dropsy gives the fatal blow .
Where the long reach of shadows play ,
Who managed steeled axe , or carried shield ,
Heedless of position took them ;
The evening they 'll hallow ,
And cares can make the sweetest love to frown :
The only glad thing that the sad land knew .
Arise and flee ! shake off the vile restraint
It crawled back to my heart again .
Like peace its soft white beams had lain ;
" the proudest strength you can assume ,
Take heed , ye shall not long escape .
To stay within their veins . chersydros sprang
Turning his eyes from the reproachful past ,
Himself above a foe to raise .
All the furies of fate circled round the man ,
Pure joys these winter nights around me lie ;
Of england floated from white towers of sail --
Pledged him to thrust dire ruin far from us ,
To follow him in fight . the rest he sends
The rocks have lain asleep so many a year ,
Anxiety grew alarm at his
Every good gone from them .
O guns , fall silent till the dead men hear
Care be banished , patience won ;
Peace let the dew send !
Their wistful eyes in floods of sorrow drown 'd .
Repullulation gives me here
Until it hangs divine and beautiful
Louder they talk , and louder come the strains
And drew forth flowing streams of waters clear ,
I boast me sprung from ancestry renown 'd
So many kind deeds she wrought :
Lies our buried faith , full near to perish ,
And on the spike that split the mother 's heart
Winds , unthrottle the wolves of war !
Around me shone keen eyes of men :
Total they mix , union of pure with pure
So that of all the mounting summer 's wealth
And thou shalt see thy thought another way .
And tuned him to her whimpering lust ,
It came to an end ,
That made ye once so vain .
But iron blows had hushed for aye
Spacious swank holds sway .
In princely virtues , followed near ,
Gladness bubbling from his mouth --
Yet the sunflower bends toward the sun .
But soon shall fade that bright deceit ,
That drowned in blood the morning smile !
Answered in the words which follow :
Its light poured softly in her lap . she saw
For which i left my body burned above .
Ere peal of closing battle rose ,
Its levity your conduct sway ,
Whose skill and courage set his foes at naught ;
The lotus of the lake receives
Which is very sad , you see .
She cast one weary vacant look around ,
Is gone ; our peace , our fearful innocence ,
Joy 's noble purple brightly flows !
A day of storm so often leaves
The weight within them strive to draw them down .
Round and round where the idols gaze
Some relic that might sain him
To this low earth was pleased to pass
They met with coldest glances ,
Which raised the dust , for hills and valleys broad
Is more than my heart can give .
How soon the summer 'll pass , --
And all alone went she .
The thunder of taman filled men with fear .
That melts the fogs in limpid air ,
To make proceedings null .
Hence have come ardent thoughts and waking dreams
Our present to labor binds us ,
To god the father makes his sacrifice
Damascus and all syria 's kingdom swayed ,
That path ; and hard behind him followed doom .
“ sufficient strength the deadly wound to give .
To reverse and undo the unholy spell .
That take place between chatham and cherry ,
We 'll draw the curtain while the family sleep --
Once , i recall , at the table i leaned
Is , learning to reduce his past expenses .
Your tree put forth these phantom flowers
Oh , long before the various tale could run ,
" too near the stars themselves have gone ,
Kingdoms may fall , and crumble to decay ,
Of the mass that closed it o'er ,
Some silver-fingered fountain steals the world .
Rising , the crumbled earth above them threw
Shall ever wash away , what men
Victory crowns the just .
When the sweet spasm turns to agony
Then all around loud thunders broke ,
Leaving poor willie froze to beat the band ,
The house roofs seemed to heave and sway ,
I seek , but hither come to crave the fight
Each age has deemed the new-born year
Where all his potentates in council sate .
Spreads havoc , and collects its scattered fires .
Of gilded helplessness be battered through
Drawn through arid veins of manhood ,
The fugitive from pangs that rack and tear ;
The pangs of a heart that is broken .
Which love makes for thee !
That cried to have its chaos shaped :
With recollections time can not destroy ,
'cause ginerly the side i take 's
Great doubts will find an answer .
The food passes endlessly , droll combinations in brown
Forth with their followers went th ' appointed guards ,
Where'er the walls of paris wound about ,
Each man in order fills his proper place .
And wade in liberty ?
In prayer and patience disciplined his soul ;
And feel the primal sex of heaven and poetry :
May thy blue pillars rise .
The voice ceased and a murmur ran through hell ,
To find a way fast did i go ,
With rifles singing back to victories ;
Till the new sorrow come , once more reminding us
In death her lost achilles , tears they shed ,
To give you poundage from my wages .
He joined the union , found himself in jail
My pure and happy heart can see ,
But when flushed autumn and the snows went by ,
My eyes with tears are aching . --
But a more perilous trial waits thee now , --
Had been gathering silent -- at last the storm broke
To make the world this harmony ,
A knight ’s hall gave them harbouring
Above the crooked roofs the clouds go sailing ;
Then came the war time . when its shadow beckoned
' that not a heart which in his level came
And question whence the building rose , and how ?
That a halo round him clings ;
Finding its strength beyond their power :
Ere it catches a flush from the rosy day ;
Deep are the days the old arts bring :
Which kept them silent in the page ;
At once the sounding breeze was laid :
The only eyes that watch my rite .
And tears swift flowing , thus he made reply :
While then came the thoughts of years soon sped ,
And cast the load of anguish from thine heart :
His loyalty is spread on his hollow breast
And little birds break out in rippling song !
The devil left his tracks :
Where paphia 's arms have hung in joy .
The war would end before we took a hand .
Wal life ’s sweetest moments wor flying away .
When the night fell and i had shaped myself
On which the sunbeam 's amber pale is thrown
Because the thought comes icy ;
Wilt thou then thy promise keep ?
But follow where it flies , and win
Bring grimly slaughter to the fleecy flocks ;
To his dear mother his whole soul looks back ,
Till the moon had long passed over .
Stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief .
Brings a third of magic import .
Now leading on the wars of god ,
I followed true , for me right good ,
My wishes are not always met ,
Of the path where the world may pass ) ,
That strange wild awe which haunted childhood thrills ,
And to the most of praise add something more ;
And the green earth sprang beautiful to day !
Till five more years were sped :
What madness has your alter 'd minds possess 'd ,
Where love to death lay sick .
But she , that rose the tallest of them all
Earth and heaven in blazing destruction !
Like the last echo born of a great cry ,
Only to yield thee gladness of my voice ,
Comes here to saunter , having made his bets ,
Or perhaps lilac with gold shotted through ?
In early times the pilgrims drew
Into stone had changed their waters .
That drove me here before the promised hour .
Over the clear red roofs they flow and pass .
Full fire is centered , swims and glows
But soon i found that sorrow , worn
Our impious battles the just gods provoke .
There breathe the passionate breath of orange-flowers --
The labouring fires come out against the dark ,
Black waters moan , through valleys struck with blight ,
The presence of a treasure , walls conceal ,
Softly , softly slumber comes ,
Dancing and flying , the little leaves went ;
If grief come early
And made proposals for that lovely maid ;
Sometimes with hatred , or the hatred turns
To make out my meaning by shrugs and grimaces ,
't was palm-sunday -- when descended ,
Sad but sweetly encircle the soul ,
Preventing fate directs the lance awry ,
Be wise , and use thy wisdom well ;
They shot through the great cathedral door ;
It would not call the dead to life again ;
No tree could ever bear them twice .
Where the grasses waved like the ripening grain
The year complete , fed with delicious fare
To catch other than the truth :
Are chas 'd by certainty , and terror turn 'd
A fancy came solemn and sad ,
With outworn loves long cast aside ,
That far outreaches all philosophy .
But tell of days in goodness spent ,
The final wave , when the tide goes out .
Higher , higher , gathering light ,
When politics came there , to mix
Upon thy hearse i shed no useless tear , --
Of little moments are the days to spare .
Suffering no flowers except its own to mount ?
Tom wilkin drest up in his best ,
Here a rich juice the royal vineyard pours ;
But when from one 's own cheeks comes bursting forth
Soon as its summer pomp the mead assumes ,
Which no spring of strength would quell ;
Imprisoned are , and not allow 'd to tread .
Branches of olive in their hands they bear ,
And found and kissed his love again ....
Great ones worthy the word that was to come ;
Of good goes out forever ; the beacon
I bet mowg 's the smartest cat
Get the field and win the day ;
But with the tenderest pity brought it home .
With furious wrath was stirred .
We 'd gained our first objective hours before
My failing heart he fortified ,
As lovers to whom time is whispering .
The heart of him who leaves the slumbering earth
For hearts that kindle , thoughts that glow ;
But she felt her strength was failing ,
Their spears like brittle glass to pieces went ,
I had felt the thrill that her presence brought ,
The bond which nature gives ,
In conducting this large and salubrious war ,
Have lighted up and led his age ,
Within he takes a day or two 's repose ;
Beneath the earth has fared , a fallen sun ,
Autumn winds sighing ;
The dreamful billows beat a rune
Where the trees are swinging their arms about .
And all thy heart lies open unto me .
And life 's wild ways with cautious fear explore .
So you would make death work your will .
Through eden took thir solitarie way .
Already freighted no more freight be placed .
And if he ca n’t restore the broken heart ,
And go their way for others ; making light
She only feels she moves towards bliss ,
While the leaves by their sad looks have spoken
Or be counted vulgar and set at naught .
And thousands of sighs swell their grand melody .
Comes the honey of all sweet ,
But i , whom griping penury surrounds ,
Wisdom , though fled far away .
To reach some point of excellence in art .
Which leaves a taxable balance of fifteen pounds .
Lethargic some , and mute ; some , giving loose
Toward air has driven where no shadow shrouds .
The purple soul comes floating in the flood .
Learn 'd things , that to his victory gave rise
The strange flowers ' perfume turns to singing ,
Sad from her eyes there rose --
Will not make the soft ore harden . '
Is but a part of what he bears .
I suffered chains and courted death ;
Love in her train stood ready for his prey .
But , set apart for sacred use , commands
Proffers and thanks had followed , with a round
To hold thy course among the heavenly stars ,
All that life so cruel robbed from thee .
Discovering that which makes the wind to blow . '
As any king 's son you might lightly see ,
And the blush on your cheek that lies --
My hopes are gone , my pleasures fled ,
By hosts of living thoughts are led ;
Uns nowadays -- all past joys fled --
Which hid my idol was a thing of clay ,
And their playtime they take ,
Kapo took the cones selected ,
The copious accents fall , with easy art ;
His mind to heaven could soar ; with mental eyes
I 'll meet the raging of the skies ,
And toss the miles aside for me .
But fill me with the old familiar juice ,
They 're taking riding lessons by a correspondence course ,
His wonderous course directed to the west :
Tossed into bright confusion .
Distress-guns was firing , the surf running high
Are those , which make thee beat thy wings below
So shone with light which ráma gave
't was sweet to follow him !
A land of peace where lost romance
Thy question shows me thy belief to be
Shapes like his were coming in the buds ;
And still the daintiest - go your ways ,
There 's fear afoot . comes more than once
Little of mortal life remained to me ,
Into each life some rain must fall ,
This is the virtue that sustained
Filled full of pride he flies to a tree
Their best defences to that side to bear ,
Through pureness filtered crystal-clear ,
An unsuspected storm . his hour was come .
Many a son is left without a father ,
Onward come the hour of woe ! "
The clouds their backs together laid ,
To save thy secret soul from nightly fears ,
And merged her rose-red beauty in july ,
Still to my soul these terrors cling ,
His face turned toward its tail .
Loudly they talked of his money that 's gone ,
Haply , it yet a throb may give --
And weariness of life , that makes me ready
As labor vainly lost .
A little wit to gain ;
If all things work together
Those raised new empires o'er the earth ,
Who shall these lingering notes redeem ,
'till every starving soul thine influence feel !
With meeting lips and mingling smiles they sup
To nonsense , reason 's self they turn ;
Making all the paris day colorful and sweet !
The sea her erst gifts recalling ;
I drank the heaven of her gaze with sighs --
The grass sucks green , the lily white .
Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew
Thirteen , to which the stone had lent
The drooping fir trees let their darkness trail
Eh ? the whole seems to fall into a shape
And you make light of it all ,
That all my sense in ravishment was lost .
For , as the word had gone about that waste
And let the sorrowing crowd about it grow ,
With meditation centred inwardly ,
Before the deeds were done which they displayed .
It never falters , stanch and brave .
My headache has gone . ' "
Would fain have taken my virginity .
Know where death will surely follow ,
A constant bounty which no friend has made ;
That bears the cross of war .
Whose dear lives were put in peril .
To rávaṇ bore the mournful tale .
The melody hung in the pallid night ,
Nearest the throne but held a place
That blushing red no guilty instance gave ,
And with a voice which woe made faint
Then cast away care , let sorrow cease ,
He will save humbled italy , and restore ,
But when her mother , filled with anxious care
Forgetting what good knights to virtue owe ,
And learned bards of it their ditties made ;
To perfect peace hath changed despair .
Lord , make it clear to me . "
A perfect spirit in himself he shaped ;
Give thou peace unto the cattle ,
Of shining metal in shillings counted ;
To take what paines may anie living wight :
Telling of the good work wrought ,
The dew that on the mountain lies ,
No path we shun , no darkness dread ,
The human heart asks love . but now i know
It never rests till meeting face to face ;
And she dropped me a curtsy .
A chestful scarce will yield one sterling crown .
But darkness that knows no end
Moves and directs thee ; then no flattery needs .
Then silence fell , and where the low cloud hung
Much wealth the bráhmans bore away ,
Whose influence is thine , and born of thee :
A period put to their sad misery !
What rocky heart to water will not wear ?
The winds of march are humming
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell .
Nor then till the viceroy stood by .
" thy daughter comes to drive me to despair .
Rejoiced , because their way lay heavenwards .
That comes with the pleasant night air .
It is nothing to me , the beauty said ,
In attitude and aspect formed to be
No day shall dawn but sees my pain ,
And those that heard him sickened where they lay .
Till evil wrought its spell ,
The holy oil ordained to burn
And hope , that laughs at present pain ,
To a quiver robin went ,
With wailing voices raise their liquid dirge .
Thus vents his grief in lonely sighs ,
Their courage quite subdued , the trojan host :
The sad bells bow the forehead on the hands .
Did in the midst on airy columns stand ;
And find thee still each day the same ;
To get us a charter of peace . ’
My fortunes all as fair as hers who lay
Of the spirits risen awhile ,
Along a stream that raced and ran
And set the wall between us once again .
The faith in which my father stood ,
The joyous wind is wandering free .
When lo ! there came a sudden light .
And the false foxe him helped to array .
For here lies the pleasure of living :
My childhood 's earliest thoughts are linked with thee ;
And thine infinite bosom that teaches
Where the abbey makes us we ;
Till the woods are taken quite ,
Whate'er the circling seasons yield ,
But early took the veil and hood ,
Such glory as her joyful eyes have drunken ,
Than beauty turned to sourness .
And the raven his nest has made
So fast the darts on either army pour ,
Thy heart while mine goes famished . glad ,
And leave them then as it left them now .
They fill with purest awe my swelling soul ;
Leave go my hands . fain would i walk alone
Its solemn tribute of affection brings .
Now chiefly venus spreads her empire sweet ,
An old song made by an aged old pate ,
And fragrant flora wears a lasting smile .
And all its branches , toning chill ,
Even in death some melody will make .
And the rough waves of life for ever laid !
And makes our snow less pure than our morality ;
Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns ;
What the trees of britain say . "
Of sleep , which instantly fell on me , called
A faith that is knowledge shall rise and grow .
Insult his wounds , and make them bleed anew .
To fight as one perforce made wroth
How arthur 's death were compassed and resolved
To meet the fate of poor red riding hood .
To seek for vengeance on the enemy ,
I cast all hope of my return away ;
The fleeting bloom to doom consigned .
And in the yellow sand the sparkling fragments lay .
Seem sprung from poison-sown disease .
Yet within my soul there dwelt
Nor solely dare encounter hostile rage ,
But such an assertion deserves only scorn ,
As fade the phantoms of a wizard 's cell
With endless change of rapturous duties fired ;
Of mortal shape his spirit wore .
Adown canals it came ,
Takes the peace that twilight brings :
Where ev'ry air that shakes
My humble hopes to nothing melt .
Till the tidings have filled the earth !
Thus onward as through life we go ,
She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand .
The which my drama cares not to rehearse ,
The flower within her bosom slips .
We can manage to make a street parade ,
Where joy in fullness crowns the conquering soul .
So fiercely flames ; so wildly comes the cry
To which for crest the golden dragon clung
And roses wither as they blow .
And there came to his chrism-loosing
The tie is broken that kept me back ,
The lion roars , the woods resound .
Grand as we were when treading royal ways .
An open heart that knows no wrong .
Held its reign in all the counties .
And all the lands the southern ocean wears ,
Where air would wash and long leaves cover me ,
Made a promise to that still , cold face ,
Then bring thy friends , secure from future harms ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
Sheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies .
To his songs the sun gave hearing ,
To ribe the royal corse they bear ,
Close watch , where thou art lowly laid .
Yon rising moon that looks for us again --
And prayer dissolved me in a fervent bliss .
No moan escaped him at the stinging pain .
( the sunlight settles on the sea ) --
Their gold and plate to strangers to be spent .
That blew against them slowly veered . the sails
Since it was made it had known change .
Sparkling , flashing in the sunshine ;
And wash the body whence the life has died ,
Soft tears his grief explaining .
Which his smiling features tell ,
And all your wrongs the proud oppressors rue !
And the lowering thunder grumbled ,
And what retain ? his intellect ?
On your hand as it waved adieu
Of holy things to make a sport ,
For the preacher whom we bring ,
Come on . i want to see the fun .
And down its mortal fissures sinks away .
Shall see the crime he strives to hide ,
The voice of praise may never reach .
The biting axe of florence . farther on ,
The page stopped weeping and smiled cold --
Who died with eyes set straight ahead , amid the
The bibliographies include books of verse only .
Prevented they should come to blows :
And leave the joys of christmas day ;
Thronging the shores around stand the pitying multitude ;
To raise its genius , and direct its rage .
Your strength shall gain ,
So dawning day has brought relief --
Had it brought the bride of beauty .
Thro swaying terrors of tormented tides ;
Wherefore i turned me to my counsel sage .
The pangs that guilty spirits bow ?
For i , as sunlight kills the morn ,
So as fortune with him wente ,
Where the low sun casts long shadows .
That came in neptune 's plea ,
That marked the pendulum 's time-measured stride
To take a rest .
He bade his heart go to her ,
That truth henceforth should fill your page ,
The blessed standard made to me reply ,
My eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears ,
And lack of pity made them cold .
Where work lay for the asking it seemed that men
Nor any bed to give the show
And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
Which made a sullen streamlet of each vein ,
When truth is found in falling tears ,
Would take the german presidency -- teddy . "
How we ever can get through
Through this dread shape the suffering ages look ;
I felt myself the worshiper
Tyrants fall in every foe !
And loud his shout of triumph rang .
And his proud hopes already win the prize .
And hills were hid in dusky shades of night :
There in the solemn night they interchanged
No partner now to sooth my aching heart ,
Her stature reached not to six palms in height ,
Carried away by the flood of emotion ,
Nor yet his tears and groans were stayed .
It spoke but one syllable -- " trust . "
And arrogant the dahlia lifts its head ,
Another still , to quiet and retrieve .
When slavery grasped at texas ?
Learn from fears to vanquish fears ;
And wing 'd winds pause to garner scents
Which ask herculean strength to break !
{ 64 } that time might be better spent .
Sam with his trumpet blew a rally ,
And round around him surged the dead
Full of soft streams and little winds that creep
With all its features gathered in a sneer .
Beneath my feet substantial darkness lay ,
And spent their anger on the dreaming child .
The dew fell fresh , the sun rose mild ,
The king off his hands the little gloves took ,
And vengeance take , with strains victorious ,
So manhood comes -- and so it surely goes ,
“ with pious duty her own cradle takes ,
That sits in the sun ;
On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes ,
Its bloody rain is dropping ;
And memory holds no least regret ,
The cloud his foes had follow 'd fast ,
Come and lift my shaken soul to the sacred
Forest on forest hung about his head
So bravely that fame has awarded the palm
Hath laid her babe to rest ;
And with no word into the deep hold passed .
Their voicings reach me speedily :
Which seem to linger in the holy place --
It joyed to give him light for light .
When evening comes , through the lone cottage pane ,
Why call for less than is already thine ?
They carry bluffs the highest
O never give the heart outright
Slurred by those added braveries ;
Where comfort turns to trouble ,
To thee our eyes with pride we lift ;
Seeking the lost cause and the brave defeat !
The little lives that swarmed beneath the moon ,
And that the spending made 'em glad .
That the cold wind makes in rivers .
Vague blossoms stirred by wings of eidolons ;
And turkeys sought the safest tree
But love was all that ever grew .
The air he went thro ' .
If he seeks and finds salvation ,
And perfumed flesh that sings and glows
Scarce from the stammering lips had faintly passed ,
The brief race of time well and patiently run ,
That the lips which thrilled to your lips of old
The wind got up with the morning --
Let us put on afresh our heavenly armor ,
That held your honored lady ! "
Who fed with moonbeams dropping silent dew ,
From the river winding clearly ,
He wins the garland ere he runs the race ;
Amidst heaven 's rolling heights this earth who stayed .
God gave thee gracious ministers
Where frightful rocks , were frowning big with fate ;
Which was made to make us free ,
We are the hard-luck folk , who strove
Where to repel him rose a foe .
Less dreadful death shall rise ,
Her trick of meddling grew so much .
At whom the gods in sport their weapons threw --
Till the stars had run away ,
And odin came , and laid his kingly hands
Round the table joy and peace prevail .
Down the wild wind of vision caught and whirled ,
That he made sign the battle should not be
O god , take the reins of my life !
By his contrarie is every thing declared .
My spirit , touched by mercy 's ray ,
Lakshmaṇ , the chief whose arrows laid
Tells the havoc that was made .
To match the music strains its wild essay ,
For mariage : and it fell so ,
Long after winter and her aching frost
I 'd teach thee change thy lover every day ,
Bear fleeting memories , that come and go ;
And easter sunday gleamed upon the sky ;
Make haste before a wasting life is gone !
Let wisdom and benevolence stand near ,
The snow fell hissing in the brine ,
And the word made manifest , --
And smile content to know what makes them sweet .
To his tent bore him his friends so true ,
Vain all the gifts that fortune can bestow .
See who they be that this pursuit do make ,
Till love gregor come hame ? "
Of rarest work the elfin art could mould ;
Cruel time can never seize that prey .
They only add them all in an appendix ,
The passage of the water take ,
And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds ,
The name of battlefield each one would bear ,
Her looks , her sighs betrayed it ;
The brave ones stand alone !
That lingers in the garden there .
The waves their ever restless motion stayed ;
The centuries leave nothing but your name ,
But life and love will soon come by .
As what the limits of our earth contain :
It sitteth at her side .
Where winds know how to sting ;
I would have given thee comfort in the work .
The heart that owns thy tyrant sway ,
To shifting cloud or hour ,
That succeeded , and over and through the refrain
Ere yet to nestor i the tale relate :
Than either ocean 's firths begin to toss
Hot july brings cooling showers ,
The precious odors poured ; --
Made promise of the way her sect enjoins .
Canst thou point out that flock to me ,
Her rainbow-radiant corslet clasped she then
For thee she feels sincerity of woe ;
He for the burthened sweet deliverance wrought ;
I fathered such a nature , whence it came .
The poor bosom beating against her .
But the pure ether of the soul remains .
And baubles galore which discretion enjoys --
There we find a nature also ,
All life went forth , and the forest fled
That runs from the city to gaul ,
Shakes the sacred lodge with terror ,
And seeing took fire for joy .
Here build , and dread no harsher sound ,
And by degrees from underneath it came
In these things there lies a deep meaning ;
An age with wisdom to assume ,
With horror sat they fast ;
Happiness comes out of fat .
Tell that it fears all night to rest alone ,
The old year greedily grasped his plunder ,
A place for slumber and sorrow to meet ;
The golden light should lie ,
On love scenes drawn from this dear family .
To show that one heart was loyal yet .
One tumult , one great rushing storm of wings
Will look to after souls who were not there
In silence shed the ceaseless tear ,
When your dauntless chiefs shall lead you ,
Of the octagon chapel , the dreamer lifted up
Loveliness over the strings of the heart may stray
And to the lady ’s saddening heart revealed
With brows whence all the light had fled .
And when the same it hath gone round
By incommunicable music stirred ;
They seemed as trees walking the earth ,
Forgot the scornful world that passed me by .
A countenance in which did meet
My brother sought the battles in kansuh ;
No window-bars shut out the stars ,
Keeping slow time with horrors in the blood .
And now the glittering mountains rise to view .
O'er the wide world new various forms arise ;
O'er my white sheets that fever spun .
My love hath deepened , with my wiser sense
Under whom every wickedness lay dead ,
So tallest trees that tour toward the skies ,
That ran with eddies multiplied ,
It flashes , guiding from afar
Med ' cine and food she bears .
The sergeant gives the poker a savage twist ;
There are hearts that want to sleep ;
What pines on every mountain sprung ,
The tither stooked raw ,
Without a god no day can rise ,
Hence a blessed soul is fled ,
I reckon , as i count my woes ,
There goes some prime oud cheese !
All lies as nature formed it , rough throughout ,
And playfully the lovers plague the fair .
Fathoms nine its sides extended ,
Has filled my heart with sore dismay . ”
And now my stately soul to hades shall descend .
Leave naught undone of what you have to do ,
And force the king from his intent . ”
Good minds and open actions take new might ,
Its fitful and mysterious dirges play .
And all bright trees their blossoms showed .
You prayed that conquest might your arms attend ,
And i 'm worn from the weather .
Their threats and fury all went wide ;
She could not figure forth a happy fate ,
They only claim a right to eat ,
Thy vision will lay hold upon me dead ,
For he wrote as his crosses came , and went
Far-called our navies melt away --
As the heart beneath did wield
The little pebbles lay .
The interpretation also may come true .
" here springs the forest from the single stem :
By all i hold most sacred and most solemn -
To their shrill protests make reply ,
Pushed on as by the hand of fate
Loud when wintry winds arise ,
" what of the garden i gave ? "
His swerve had brought but a minute 's rest ,
Heaven 's heaviest blow has fallen on me ,
It made me light and gave me wings .
Thy mortal passage when it comes . -- ascend
The coming years a gladsome change may bring .
And pour thy tale of sorrow in my ear .
A blessed calm was given .
To hide deceit , and give the harmless show
And custom lie upon thee with a weight
There mars its course arrested . then with shouts
Thou givest from thy vasty sides forlorn
Stupidly stand the factory chimneys staring over all ,
The favour 'd shore -- an ancient city lay ,
And shall she bear a heavier heart ,
The moon mounts up , the night is late :
At least to make a prey :
All these woes and hopes defeated ,
That shut for everlasting , came a clang ,
His fame full six miles round the country ran ;
Thus pledged the maid her vow of bliss ;
Cast his eyes upon the sunrise ,
The days went by with laughter and with love .
Yet i bear a heart shall support me still .
But if success i must never find ,
So shalt thou pierce the text 's disguise :
Will trace the story of endymion .
( it pains me this fact to relate ) ,
Bright rewards by god are given .
' mid the glowing fire they cast him .
This righteous path , by duty led :
And i could feel the little holes you made --
Then purcell touched the strings , while numbers hung
And hither tempt the pilgrim steps of spring .
Her fame to keep , her fame to recover .
Sad as the last which reddens over one
Joy like a stream flows through the christmas streets ,
Is there no way to pick a quarrel ,
Who makes me shed the silent tear .
And when her senses came again ,
Be crushed by dark grief , nor do thou lament
He took the occasion , as they stood intent ,
The mighty is fallen , our hope is departed --
Its schooling was giving ;
Than eagles have -- for days to come
To find the precious morning hours were lost .
And he went the fish to capture ,
Kind admonitions gave her not to mourn ,
With bridal chimes the echoes rang ,
And barking , cuts the wave with furious joy :
What it shall be , of revel mirth propelled ,
And counting each trial for truth as their gain !
But the debt we never can pay .
Power in counsel our folk to lead ,
Was swallowed up in the earthquake 's shock .
The frost hath wrought both night and day ,
For winter maketh the light heart sad ,
When outside the winds blow strong
And a line was drawn north-westerly
And far her restless feet swift glancing went .
And all that fortress found they full of war
Down the precipitous rocks they sprung ,
And she , in service , found a hidden way
And round his heart one strangling golden hair .
Bharat will share the empire still . ”
Her silence tells of treason hid :
What treasures lie beneath the waves
With drifting clouds , that trail the shadowy shower .
That breathed an odour as of nectar , yea ,
That presence filled the garden .
Shows the same sadness everywhere ,
The captain stuck by bold piggy .
And fix your claws in nicol 's heart ,
The lazy body lies at rest in ,
Which passes ghosts in currency like gold ,
And be harmed by this beauty of mine .
His body into prison lay ,
You bring back the days departed ,
Though its smoke shall hide the sun ,
All wisdom she , all thoughts that move
But , while constrained to hold even union less
All returning to dust and grass ,
In that sweet promise found ;
And stand here lonely , aching , chill ;
Where lances gleam and banners play ,
They made yon preacher zealous for the truth ;
When faith is lost , when honor dies ,
To walk and pass our long love 's day .
Our frailtie can sustain , thy tidings bring ,
Were fixed on his wild face and wan ;
Death introduced , through fierce antipathy :
Abide not till there come an evil day .
Possession sate his thirst , but still pursues
That keeps , till june , december 's snow .
The shouting cuckoo struck the time of year .
The chain which bound , or wish to break ,
She seized and bore the sacred charge
He gained a world ; he gave that world
The boatswain gave the dreadful word ,
Thine anger moved ; yet want i not a mind
No generous patron would a dinner give .
The charm it holds for the restless rover ;
And gave their silent thanks to god .
If fog and slush hold sway ;
With reverence when their names are breathed .
Heaven sends to guard the golden age ,
Hope , for such losses , made amends :
Which gave a lustre passing light .
And leaving quiet what no strength can move ,
That ere the ravished hour for richness heaved .
As lavish time comes down the way
Lifts up its face for thy promise given .
Cast thy heart , do not faint or wail ;
Darkness to daylight shall lift up thy paean ,
With sense of life on life , and makes
Whose billows rocked the drowsy honey-bee
Nor sorcery nor falsehood left . king carle
Sleep , with wings in darkness furled ?
Tho ' pestering clouds may sometimes blunt his rays ;
There 's youth in every breath we take ,
The sacred gem my arms embraced .
But the young maid gave him answer ,
For us let all the rage of torture burn ,
I raised the lids o ' the truth ,
And the piper found a use for
My cruel fate is held in other 's hands ,
Fresher shall the living grow .
Sent thee their tribute with each rolling wave ,
Behold tiresias , who his semblance changed ,
Still takes its sweet impression as it flies ,
The saddest heart might pleasure take
Would it blur the christmas glee ,
Whose feather flies from love .
His son and father alone he snatched from death ;
With stifling heat , heaving it up in sleep ,
With peace and oceans echoed glories in her ear
They roll along by any plan of gods .
Away each fine resemblance bore , }
All day we swayed from lovely hope to fear .
Her dream is shown to be inept ,
And yet dire fears will gather in our throat ,
The shepherd of the forest went .
And all the beauteous joy seems made
Like a ghost , that goes at sunrise ,
These shall recall that thou hast known
The far-heard echo of their music knew !
Mournful , from things defeated , in the throes
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
Saddening it is when the night has descended ,
Oh ! how thy praises sing ?
A true defence before the world can make :
Who only gave him birth and death ?
Now , therewithal , was come the night
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink .
No time the dear remembrance can remove ,
And from infinity there fell a balm ,
They who to warmer regions run ,
Red on my soul that branded cain ;
As showed vice had his hate and pity too .
Their nelson 's word , to beat the foe ,
It brings back that winter of mad delights ,
Until he gives death as he gave us life ,
Strong-smitten steady chords , ye seem to flow
Love warred with friendship : heart with conscience fought ,
While moonlight lies soft on the sea ,
And uncomplaining snows -- which make no sign ,
As spring 's sweet breathing comes the voice
By homespun beauty poured !
Soon will come the noontide ,
Something that would make his heart more light .
So here they fall to strife ;
I too may harbor witches , and some devil
And this dear heaven i set within my heart ,
Wild , conquering shudder , shaking herself free ,
In arms the glittering squadron rising round
They of our mortal diseases find never healing physician ;
Than that which struck us from our past surveys ?
Which threatened soon to overwhelm my senses :
My chestnut mare -- ca n't help feeling moved ,
What aspects old time in his progress has worn ,
Bade them rise up in beauty ,
Now enclosed in pangs of hunger ;
Those stabbing points of the sky
He found his error of the double race ;
With great revenge , immortal praise acquired ?
And quick leaves cast a shimmer of green
A frenzy of assurance grew ,
I like its claws caught in my lace ,
But sends it flood-tide and creates itself
Another 's wealth on his to lay ,
I found far sweeter than the scene below .
The roadside trees still dripped with dew ,
Half sob , half laughter , music swept along ;
Blind buds that snows have shaken ,
Where the lark fails of flight
Staid winter 's passed and spring 's about
Bring all the noblest traits together ,
Moves and directs thee ; then no flattery needs .
The name , that springs forever in my breast .
And this same flower that smiles to-day ,
Again their stories of destruction tell .
Which follow 'd great aeneas to the war :
Tears from that great heroic soul sprang up ;
The chill of death is passing , life will shortly
This flame of joy comes clamoring
Some to his feet with reverence pressed ,
About to seal my doom .
All things he saw showed double , and he groaned
The sawn wood followed ; last of all
And lit with purer flame the ethereal mind .
And now when night made dark the pole ,
The sun came dazzling through the leaves ,
Tears make the sparkles wet ,
Fletcher , whose fame no age can ever waste ,
From the dinned ways where chariots roll ,
I feel to treasure up your dying words .
The friendly gossip come from every land ;
Higher still the wall shoots upward . "
The weary find a shelter from all storms .
Feel warm enough to raise the sap , which plays
Which had recounted time for years and years ,
' the air is cut away before ,
That stout maroon leather , they pierced altogether ,
That were all his birthdays reckoned
Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise ;
But his sagacious eye an inmate owns :
What point it was that i had lately passed .
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill :
The breezes whisper round me still ,
My wits are collected , my aim is corrected ,
Now , soft as household spirit , comes the night
To swiftly rise an atom in a host ,
And quench the animating fire ,
The clouds like swans drift down the streaming atmosphere .
Filling the night with woe ,
Walks , and a sudden music plays ,
And love was welling in her eye
Pity seized me when i heard
So preparation soon was made with vigor .
Her sorrows share , and make them less ?
Perhaps my father , you can read its meaning .
The skilled musicians made a great new song .
The jasmine , throwing wide her elegant sweets ,
Yet blossoms that smile in the green woodland bower ,
Where hermit coats of skin displayed ,
Comes melody falling in silvery showers .
Who saw two eyes with longing burn .
Hath fortune willed me to entreat ; yet so
Filled with rapture , filled with fear .
The sharp steel on through his body passed ,
Thy dying soul still fed with living pain ,
The pleasant philomel her vespers sing .
To hide the blushes on my cheek that burned ,
Was lost . the voices died away : she sank
To watch her walks , his hundred eyes applied ;
The old witchcraft still is spread . "
Yet were these wretches marked for imminent death :
Neither felt , nor affected , the wish to conceal
Were all to follow , we should see
The fund being raised , there remained but to see
That moment brought vibhishaṇ near .
Nor speech nor grasp was left : his every limb
Now wind and sun have gone home ,
And they who feel for genius may repose
Which by just right should come of mighty gods ;
From prison strong to set you free ? "
Seem 'd , when those fancied chords were moved ,
The gathering gloom beguiled .
Full of cold clouds and moonbeams drifted
In wealth and multitude , factious they grow ;
Why should we pine or grieve at that ?
Though years have passed , i have remembrance yet
But then one hope arrived
The dogs ran out and barked so bold
No hurrying footstep bounds his own to meet ,
Why then should i account of little pain ,
Whatever in his eyes would make me fair .
That sent her crouching at the foot of spain ;
I heard her quick breath come and go ;
They should find her comrades shy and strange :
Vernal delight and joy , able to drive
Slow dropping o'er the threshold high doth come :
Last year came out our daughter dell ,
Two shots rang wild upon the air !
That adam felt , when from his opened side
The soul selects her own society ,
The light that on his resting place is shed .
From each to each had sprung those sparks which flew
And the billows gave me shelter , "
There is a garden made for our delight ,
" my prayer ascended and was heard ;
Through magic art could never match ,
No solemn host goes trailing by
Every leaf that courts the breeze ;
To that maxim of virtue made ashes and dust ,
Till lost amid the hungry blue ,
A fearful storm to bring such things to pass .
Dreamed of decay and stretched appealing arms ,
And not feel my sorrow ’s share ?
As thou dost thy fair curves show ,
There , in rising day ,
The strand that held the thousand ships ,
And i will meet and conquer all . ”
Who pinned his faith on ruskin ! "
And join these later days to that far time
The silent tear fell
I feel myself with kindred warmth indu 'd ;
The danish warships went ,
A troubled path whence light hath fled ;
Religion sunk in vague philosophy ,
With bloom and sweetness , freely ran and laughed
Now nearer to the stygian lake they draw :
Can she recall that mournful scene ,
For favouring winds came on .
They pressed to hear of wallace wight ,
Has traced the limits ; where no terrors float
The structure of the heavens , discern the whole
Not to nightingales give hearing ;
Send glory with him , make his courage firm !
And so my system stands protected . "
Than greece , triumphant , found that stormy day ,
Unknown to you taste secret , hidden joy .
Stops in the veins and numbness comes upon them .
Where life , the sower , stands ,
As much as his thin purse could bear .
Had left her lonely there .
At last the sun sank down , the rosy light
The war that sleeps on severn side ;
Yet for age it reserves its toy .
Where canker and corruption never comes ,
To her left hand came the blue .
Moving our hearts to joy and tears
Which a wind to pearl hath kissed ,
Think how my disappointment grew , }
The first land who rallies to battle
For if she wept when harry took his leave ,
But there thy soul shall build again
So shall authority with strength be join ’d .
Since for him life holds no beauty
Of fancy rise full springing : but not mine
This story hidden with the pain ,
That swept between the pillars white --
The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew ,
The oldest forests bowed their crowns of leaves ,
A sudden palsy seized his turning head ;
Cast their dark shadows on the snow ;
Their hands are only lent to the heinel .
His piping feeds the starved and warms the cold ,
My fears arose , i saw ills looming ,
Many there are whose prayers arise for this ;
From paradise , because it turned aside
Lighten th ' oppressive load which anguish bears ,
The maidens ’ hands in theirs they laid .
To feel for one short moment glad ,
His sinewy hands the wheel employs . "
A guard was set that he might not flee --
Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain .
A quizzical thin smile is showing ,
Wherefore a work of wonder shall be wrought ,
Yet they , too , soon confess themselves astray ,
Which ofte hath set this world unevene ,
Keeps to the banks that bar his tide .
Though laws and statutes here they made ,
Their panting mouths sucked in the nightly dew ;
But some years had fled away ;
All bathed in tears ; the melancholy train
Sad hearts lose all their sorrow ,
In february , and the song says may !
Your counsel in the strait i show . "
Always upheld by national support ,
And called for lights . along the shadowy aisles
To chase their gloom away .
I had grown used to living without you .
But catching a glimpse of his lordship 's rage ,
In comes the playmate that never was seen .
" come , follow our fairy band ! "
Eternal adamant composed his throne ;
Chearful and innocent the day he spends ,
In courage and strength pursue thine own endeavour .
" the night wind is moaning with mournful sigh ,
Then that old seer made answer playing on him
To tempt the son of god with terrors dire .
New lustre in the varied colors shone ,
I say , no one clear reason hath been given
Strikes through the wretch that scoffed at mercy 's law
To rise and dance with spring ;
Who hast with life imbued
Swiftly the brazen car comes on .
Almost of pain , runs through him when he sees
To hit the sense of human sight ;
To follow as a willing captive thine ;
Than enquiry she made for her dear betrothed knight .
A king might wish to hold in fee .
None shall stand in the way of the lord ,
Chains that bind the soul i 've proven
Held sad communion with himself :
Or favour gave or sought .
Admits it owns no everlasting nature .
Sweet stream , that winds through yonder glade
The flame of man 's redemption flickered there ,
Till twice a hundred years roll 'd o'er ;
The damp hill-slopes were quickened into green ,
Priests of unblemish 'd lives here make abode ,
Chaplains and brethren , called to such election .
And in such rites the pomp to lead .
Musing , seeking themes fitted for thee ,
See , gentle love a home may find
" his aid denied , more deadly symptoms came ,
Fatal to many , ere the camp they gain .
Those ships that bring the woman grain and meal .
The sage who takes his gold essays in vain
And the gates that showed the view !
Better than one might she keep faith with two ;
Yet took a poorer portion of the prize ,
Grief , ay , me ! hath struck my lute
Mark scotia 's fond returning eye --
Without sharp north , without declining west ?
Then from the press of shades a spirit threw
The ring which held the chain i tore ;
If fortune now compel thee to forego
By memories sadder than she can support ,
I see how folk live that hae riches ;
And merchandise ' whole genus take their birth :
Sleep will come when thou art fled .
To find their future orbs of rest ;
Where crystal streams through living turf had run ,
The sacrament that binds to the beloved ,
Our love was nature ; and the peace that floated
The bulls and bears together drew
The sword goes , and returns not ,
Did round this globe their courses run ;
He did his share to keep the peace ,
And , father , give us first to comprehend ,
Red flashed his eyes with angry glow :
Fairy-light made in the forest the snow ;
The moon swims in milkiness ,
Where fungous forms stood , gold and gray ,
And pour thy woes into no careless ear .
A marsh , where only flat leaves lie ,
Is matter , must with matter likewise fall .
Not to come forth and jeopardy his life .
There 's nothing that can ease my pain . "
That tells you all the secrets of the air ?
That breathe o'er isles where memories dwell
Will steal upon her loneliness . he plots
Seems reaching out white arms to draw him near --
Were twined together in the heart of christ .
For , with its call , comes yours ! "
What thing that passeth hem betwene :
Of flashing susurration , dashed and swirled
Where the stream is wandering ,
That which it took not as a loan .
No fears our trust shall move ;
Through the thought still spread beyond her :
Out of a dream the past will call .
As if that power but from one side came ,
To break the hun tribes .
And love has kept their memory green .
A nest of cabins , where the smoke upcurled
Woes i unfold , of woes a dismal train .
Which to express i can not language find ,
And as the evening falls brings darkness in .
The haze is swimming where the beeches stand ;
Which democrats would never bear .
Slackens a little , turn your calmer eyes
With throbs her vernal passion taught her , --
If you pitied the pain i bore .
The nations , stricken with their loss ,
Our feet are seamed with crimson scars ,
And thus six days and nights went by
What dread unsightly sights are spread
His daughter , pledged her faith to be
That seem 'd to breathe a grateful melody .
The tulips come to bloom again , the grass
No want of conscience hold it that i call
That it travels on to lament by mine . "
Like a spirit rising from the tomb ,
Where hands reached at the infinite then sank ,
Father , help our souls to rise ,
Now round us spreads the watery plain --
Who never knots of love more surer knit .
What i now feel in writing this adieu ,
And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array
The spell that holds him , and awake ;
She felt she could have given her life
As much , but not with anger , moved .
Till love came down it !
And drowsy pleasure soothed their blood .
No motion made as he a course would run ;
With the eye 's spirit running forth to meet
Because it rained , it made it so .
He that would free from malice pass his days
Sad it fell upon the heart of marko ,
Shall tell your soul the reason why .
A plainly set , but well-cut solitaire ,
The saints who made their dwelling there
As the bent given to philosophical and literary studies developed
Fixed to no spot is happiness sincere ,
Nor vengeance ever comes !
Whispering the gentle thoughts of god .
Angry grows , and much disheartened ,
Nor books nor schools its hidden wealth unveil .
To catch the countless prayers to heaven ascending --
And swift the troubling thought came o’er
Would cool the fever in his brain .
Sighed , and began to gather heart again ,
As rhymes direct the rage of art .
No tempest gave the shock :
There it became a voice , and issued thence
That lay in the house that
It sailed the sunlight , and struck red
By fortitude , with patience joined ,
The stern grey mountains rise ,
That no pomp of words could claim :
Soon the earth will veil my misery . "
Plish essays to pull him clear ;
To gain the boon his soul has sought ,
Why feign to spread a cheerful feast ,
And leading all his knighthood threw the kings
All wonderful , filled full of pains to come
Follow thou thy young wife 's wishes ,
By him against that race in vengeance stirred .
Till seas of seraph music round them rolled .
And happy spirit , that , unseen , reposes
Sometimes they bring a song -- a joyful cry ,
His tranquil eyes with rage were blurred ;
My rage , and these barbarities repay !
Grew thin as snow that lives on into may ;
And fills the earth with use and beauty . )
As tho ' it felt the pang of inward shame
Nor uglier follow the night-hag , when called
When less will be left to fate --
Divine æneas brings the dardan race ,
And the snows of woe 's winter are drifting
The secret longings that arise ,
He felt himself beyond all human aid ,
In plaintive voice his sorrows told .
Made it settle on the war-ship
Now i found their luscious cloying ,
Sis ' butterfly aimed to work all right ,
They went on sitting with their fellow-peers .
Is such a shy , transforming sorcery
For us he bears the sultry day ,
Her lord will find new pleasures .
His thunder on thy head , devouring fire .
It makes men rich in greatest poverty ,
And the petals that shoot in an intricate maze ,
Or past , though piercing fear .
Of patriots bursting with heroic rage ,
To scoop her grave beneath the crushing tide :
That eastward still shall spread for us
Then sweeps them onward in her mournful train .
For though the pope had seten them beside ,
Would make one 's home so cosy !
Now lashed to fury , see the waves rebel
So she spoke the words which follow ,
And one poor eye that bears no glint ,
They hung about his sketch like beasts at bait .
Which lays its bulk from shore to shore , --
A false pretence . waterland expressed his disapproval of
That ' neath his banners wrought out his command ,
How deadly was the glare it cast ,
And birks extend their fragrant arms
Bathed in their blood and breathless , lay .
Did thy still eyes follow me !
Whose bending canvas bears her to the shore :
Till it recover from the stormy thrill , --
Then received it . now it lies
Thus the ancient bard made answer :
Or the steep walls obstructed , round them cast
The raven was the fitting name he bore ;
For drinking and beauty , for fighting and love ?
" but a little time passed over ,
And drank the last life-glow ;
Saw the folly of resistance ,
So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith :
We want a chief to bear the brand ,
Where legions marched and wound ' mid snowy peaks ,
That i would never dim my faith
And vainly pierce the solemn gloom ,
Could my courage find fresh life !
No flaw deforms , no difficulty thwarts ,
In lengthened train meanwhile the snake went on ,
For true wisdom and joy go together ;
Till twice a hundred years rolled o'er ;
His ' minstrel ' lays ;
That haunted silence filled the shadowy room ;
Give glory to the lord ,
Let the willow drive them homeward ,
They take our best , the passing years --
" fortune what more remains , that thou on me
The morning comes from the east ,
Seven hundred years have well-nigh passed away ;
He passed in writing all the winter moons ;
Back to its own primordials goes away .
And pass in grief my time ,
Or in thick shade retired , from him to draw
That told him what they 'd like to say --
Till winter comes with icy thumbs
They fluttered off like withered souls of men .
The hearts of men bear worship unto her .
And deal a wound that lingers ;
Swift at their touch dissolved the ties , that clung
The trees put forth their bloom , that his embrace
And seized with horror in the shades of night ,
If meat the gods give , i the steam
For fourth of july had come .
When my looks go after you ,
When human is supported by divine .
Has not this war put by resist not evil ?
From the river winding clearly ,
You may find what you want in a scot .
“ and the devoted bodies gave to join .
In vain the faith that bore the cross ,
And round the body wrapt its funeral flames .
O'er each deep road the hero to sustain ,
And see such names of joy sit white upon
Mingled the gorgeous blossoms
Whose pining visions dim , forbidden hopes profound ,
Love flew with a whispered good-bye .
And waste the solitary day ,
As she threw blackness everywhere
When his bloody face broke into a grin
Which thy decree has made his own .
With their splendour the world rang .
The days that lengthen into years went on .
His bursting passion into plaints thus poured .
Holding joy not impossible to one
I give my youth to you !
And drew all eyes its love to trace --
Too surely ruined me and sapped my life .
And yet with modest shame combined ,
There falls the rhythmic beat of life and death :
To hear a footstep that will never come .
They see the flash with sudden lightnings flare ,
Marvelous darkness shadow 'd o'er the place .
From good to good , revolving here and there .
Who led by evil thoughts away
All have departed from this once gay haunt
And time will make your fingers deft
Yet through his veins a chill of terror ran .
And branches where the summer draws to head .
Thy proudest masterpieces tell us how .
Headlong he fell , distracted with the wound ,
Cold freezing fell the dew ,
And in her eyes still wear the dusky night .
I found the set face of despair .
In peace to save or war to kill ,
Till urged too far , revenge ! he cries ,
And the trifle which makes it black as night ,
Wasting in sparks as it streamed ,
The fishes spread on it their golden gills ;
Whose eye explored the dim arcade
His standard , and in church it offered ;
England , in this great fight to which you go
And sleeping birds , touched with a silly glee ,
While the sands o ' life shall run .
Each to-day is heavier made ;
To meet my coming , and my spear defy .
Of life ( whatever it was ) was blasted ;
I have met death in one i love ,
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
And brings the sign of sunset , shuts the door
But song sublimely cast
To follow time 's dying melodies through ,
To take revenge for sin and shameful crime
What deeds of darkness could it break ,
Forth to chase the elks i sent him ,
Had gained the thicket 's shade ;
And bring its snowy honours down .
All who turn to it . had this text divine
The cruel faith whose black walls hemmed him in ,
He up and down the forest bore the dame ,
The centuries pass as years ;
And there rose strange rumors and vague alarms
Or joining both in angry conversation ,
And laying down life 's weapons , passes on .
Strephon 's kiss was lost in jest ,
And ere the night began to fade ,
In the hush the evenings bring .
The ground all heaved in waves of fire that surged
Thou who givest us protection ,
The cold insistence of the tide would roll ,
So meanly passes , that all other lots
All life 's discords sweetly blending ,
And light of prayer is spreading heart to heart ;
Thus stood , in wonder rapture-fraught ,
Comes a message from above --
Now brings a smile , now brings a tear ;
In ages old , ere time instruction brought ,
Lets in the flood , whose waters follow fain ;
Will pass as a dream of the night !
This sovereign gift of peace that makes divine ;
But give to me the snoring breeze
Of this strange story fully certified
When an end to their jubilee comes :
By mirth and wit themselves made young ,
Whose thoughts to virtue still incline .
In youth there comes a west-wind
Ah ! come the day when from this bloody shore
" one foot goes , and one foot stands ,
So he made his bid for fame ,
The excess of joy would nearly make me mad !
The shores of ilion lay beneath their lee --
He leap 'd the present age ,
While a full year was counted by the moon ,
That final strain to the last height flew
Sleep 's peaceful fingers strayed .
His craft lost twenty thousand of my franks ;
But i the secrets of high heaven reveal .
That wrapped his soul in peaceful avallon .
The garden earth had made
Eastward the moon climbed , honey-pale .
Another sound my spirit hears ,
How twice the truce the latin crimes had marred .
The mobs of cattle go ;
Take sweet revenge for helen 's pangs of heart .
Takes life , takes form , from thee ,
Could pour my secret heart of woes ,
When spring renews its prime .
In various talk the cheerful hours they passed ,
' neath which our gleaming arrows thickly sped ,
Where distraught nature clean hath gone astray ,
Must hither in their gladness come .
They have set their teeth to the pole ;
Cooling this cruel , burning pain for ever .
From acute fever they send forth such reek . "
And bliss that wipes the tears of time
Nothing has thrown so much discredit on oriental studies ,
Though great presence of mind at emergence will rise .
Superior honour , when assumed , is lost ;
Of the great shield , wherein the lion lies
But heavier fates on hector ’s corse attend ,
The wind came briskly up this way ,
The opportunities of life are brought
That lingers in the garden there .
We missed that happiness we might have found .
And those accusing lips that made no sound .
Come follow them , the path to heaven their blood
To bear your pain and worry , and those nights
Fall flat , and shrink into a trivial toy ,
For once his spirits seemed to fail ,
But they 'll disperse when you a convert see .
Where the etrurian athens claims and keeps
Who hath felt with sense grown dim
And all the dew is gone .
Which passes through the veins itself to make them .
And from your awe they our devotion take .
In splendor strew the spangled green ,
The peace that sorrow can not give ;
Truth breathed by chearfulness .
We will preserve due distance from the range
With a woman who trades with sin .
Will turn the thing called love , aside to hate
To bid wild passion 's fiery flush depart ;
Will fall on your soul like rain ! --
And thither by his guidance was conveyed ,
The mystic quiet that we felt ,
What came of her ? the bitter nights
To meet his furious onset thrown ,
And force me to a smile .
There came a circus with a clown ,
As rocks that rise through shifting sands ;
The feelings and thoughts which no lips can tell ,
Still the pie went on showing her art ,
Of symbols watching him with friendly eyes .
And hope that makes her strong ,
My mouth spoke young , was early hushed ;
I care not though the truth i show ,
The presbyter laid by the book ,
With grief too fixed for woe or tear ;
Finding the yearnings that have crushed from me
The piony by the lily here shall blow .
Fearless of wrong , reposed his weary strength .
While morning 's precious moments fly :
Does grandeur carry more of good ;
Till from the south new winds arose ;
And streams released from winter 's chain ,
Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell ,
And tracking its course as it drifts afar .
To perfectness , and give unto the form
Then came a plaintive murmur , --
The numbing cold . and winter follows her ,
Hearts that with rising morn arise !
Can raise the dead !
Till it flashed to an angry flame
Gangs went out for navy pressing ,
And therefore my heart will bow , when dew
His prayers as usual said ,
A doubtful combat , love and honor fought .
( though the pale hands cling )
When memory pictures the smoke that curled
Born where heaven 's influence scarce can penetrate :
Of eyes that pass with fitful light .
Letting my number 'd moments run away --
The craggy glen here winds , with ivy hung ,
And torches glared and clattering feet
Everything comes
To hew away the stone walls that imprison
Oh , what a shout there went
And passed as elderly ,
Found in the fathers of old ,
With ineffectual ardour sought to rise .
And prayed , while silence filled the crowded hall :
And i was to resume my duties too ,
To hold him up stretched forth his friendly arm ,
The shadows creep and touch with quietness
Had nero played on burning rome the hose
But no trace of disease could find .
And seriously resolved on reformation .
A little yet his restless heart did move .
But the spiritual link is lost , alas !
Will find its proper level ; and they aim
And to the holy spirit , " rang aloud
Perhaps he felt in nature 's broad
But conscience told us this would never do !
And what a deadly length he keeps !
That bound a mountain 's brow like bay ,
It is the gift god left the human race
How often he embraced the empty air ,
Which yet doth make my world more bright .
With pride that bore no name ;
And help the ladies make a dash ;
I might make shift upon the keel
The scene is changed and years have onward sped ;
You will find yourselves exterminate .
' twere rapture then to toss in pain ,
From the lake came sounds of hammering ,
But tenderness carried the day ;
Whose dread effect the english duke has shown ;
Sprang backward , and with terror shook ,
October turned my maple 's leaves to gold ;
Except the straggling green which hides the wood .
Which on the sinners from behind they plied .
To thought 's fierce battle going .
So sit it wel a king to have
While kingdoms rise or fall upon a shake !
My wretched life i still sustain .
And this that breaks the ties of comradry
And purchase fame by deeds well done and wrought ;
Of janasthán in death is laid :
To that which england bore .
Of psyche 's fate he took no comforting ,
In order that thou see with how great reason
And therewith rose the army , and the fire
Such numbers fell by pestilential air !
That bound her breast which hope new-fired ,
With cheerful shouts they furl the gather 'd sail
Mute , knowing our two souls might never knit ;
Give strength the evil to forsake ,
Regardless of her son the parent stood .
Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne ,
To seek a more sacred and truthful array .
Its bushy crest waved dreadful ; last he seized ,
Greetings fly fast as we crowd through the door
Whose morals suffer when they 're told the truth ,
But sullen clouds the day deform ;
That all things hold of deity .
Woven by song , truth 's youthful beauty glowed ,
I was pressed even unto the sea .
That took his tired soul to keep
No look of thine can change this smile ,
Hard his breath came through his nostrils ,
What comes when memory meets the unfulfilled .
This windy tempest , till it blow up rain ,
As thus our song arose : " you stars ,
What comfort on this raging sea ?
Lore from experience , thought from toil to gain ,
Sincerest pleasure and sweet peace still bring ;
A calm repose then steals o'er me ,
Child 's happiness knows no alloy .
Through sleepless clear spring nights filled full of thee ,
Last night the clouds scattered away ;
Of that false law god holds in hate .
The pantheon 's shadow lay .
It fills the animals with fright ,
Who thrilled with light of love in every pore ,
In silent peace his way to heaven prepares ,
The query which thy fevered organs framed ,
And wake the dormant fire of death ?
To a son of worth thou hast given birth ,
The turbulent feelings that surged through his soul
The golden chain of years scarce dipped adown
It says that in thy breast capricious
And clasping loves , with hate and hearty blows ,
For lithe , tawny forms ever prowling for prey .
It rent and tore the veil which served to hide
Then the due rites of holiness observed .
And adds another day of care ;
And now our hunter looked for something new ,
The flu was raging . so they sent me down
And clearer comes the call of waters ;
E'er shed such guiding glories from it ,
Shall round their spreading fame be wreathed ,
Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes .
The salary question next came on the board .
And poured upon thy stricken life the balm
Which sweetly waived its right to scorn ;
And find divulged the secrets they would hide .
As ere ye too shook off our temporal coil ;
And , if our very memory wore to dust ,
Pass back and there beyond unfolds the sea .
So moved by pity , stirred by rue ,
Or pray , in murdering them he made such haste
Delight more dear than words can tell ,
Their old , familiar carols play ,
As the rain that 's left in a flower ,
It is blown by the mouth of wrath !
Wave us away , and keep thy solitude .
And leave the track of devils where men built .
It has given me a duty to perform .
A smile that shone as death may shine
Where love so smoothly ran ,
Won the spoils thy valor sought .
Once gave wild sweetness to , as to a tune
Obedience best of all can show . "
Until the lamps so often counted o'er ,
As o'er his charts columbus ran ,
Bring success from former failures ;
The years shall come and pass , but we
And he went to find the sunlight ,
And i this little ballad make ,
't is clear , are sightless bodies sweeping through
And the drummer above took up the beat
The beautiful spectre showed lovely and dim ;
Its leaves , by soft winds fann 'd ;
The roads they simply bound about
Whom envy 's tongue hath not declaimed ?
A new house of commons appeared to rise ,
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes :
Arose , and sorrow left her for awhile :
Where else hath summer tarried save in thee ?
The purple path ahead until the surf sang loud .
The heirs who her illustrious race should swell .
The warblers fall into silence in the trees
Never give a sassy answer back !
' neath which had often touched their lips .
Cast thy sighing to the pine-trees ,
And silent frenzy writhing bites his chains .
Where the hueless wind passes and cries unseen .
Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him .
With many others , news through france conveyed ;
And fearing as nearer and nearer drew
On that path , that grew for us
When these words reach 'd him . whereupon he bows
Not even wilful love possessed me , when ,
Then was called a council straight .
To seek wealth and power now
Upon their fleet our angry battle pour .
Ne maked him a spyced conscience ,
Yet , lying dormant on our fathers ' beds ,
Each , breathing death , resumed his dangerous post
The church had spoken . she that dwells
Now draw thy circle , speak thy spell ,
White halls and palaces their dwellings stand ;
While the uprising nations hail thy star ,
The future like a foe in ambush lies :
The order of the phrases makes
She left for memory to caress
And spread their guardian terrors round the land ;
The rising combat sounds along the shore .
To speke of love and his servise ,
So all night long swept the strange array ,
Aside to leave the fierce sky visible ;
Which others often show for pride ,
The flames leapt with him to the ledge ,
From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat ,
He pleasure in his countenance reveals ,
Dreams of the past that paint and draw
That set the pulses beating ,
Strange rushing sound arose ,
The sun had sunk beneath the west ,
For the mountains ' hoarse greetings came hollow
Excited for a spouse i hold so dear .
Meantime all forward drew : me terror seiz 'd
The anguish sits
Do n't you know november 's come ?
" does n't it rub off the bloom ? "
Christian faith glows in thee blest :
These threaten them and blaze abroad the fact ,
Whither their wasted squadrons make resort .
Her birth , and how hither she came ,
By name solicited to give him way .
Now mill keeps order in the land ,
And i am left to mourn my grief alone .
Those beautiful leaves to which spring gave birth
Whose eyes desire the light that lightened thee ,
As the incense flows from the censer .
Which came from the soul of the organ ,
Which publishers would put their trust in ;
Which all thy thoughts in silence keep !
By those brief words , accompanied with smiles ,
That seemed to reach the center of his soul ;
And the gray-beard thus made answer :
It bears me safely o'er each swelling wave .
Since appetite by this was turned to evil . "
And women chaste , these are the things which lift
What perilous mischance hath hither led
Inchanting daughter , thus the silence broke .
O'er the dun gloom a dreadful glimmering throw ;
To pay the debt they owe to shame ;
She cast not back a pitying eye :
A thousand lights their livid flames display ,
In fitful sleep the army lay ,
The laws are formed and placed on every side ;
Will be blown by the mild summer gale :
Why should we reck of hours that rend
Power laid his rod of rule aside
Here they lie who once learned here
To meet this tragic hour .
Tears rose , perhaps , to pity 's eye :
Wrong must be hated if the truth remain .
We draw from the most impious murder done
And leave it emptied of all else but truth .
Austere and fine the trees stand bare
See the woods waving . what late eve in fine
' you 'll get his character from walter scott :
Hardly had a year passed over --
So ugly things ca n't see
Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill .
And evening mists began to roll ,
And loses all remembrance of the sun .
Benign , of calm maturity , she stands
There came a glad surcease :
Where a heart still beat for thee , beloved .
The poet went out weeping -- the nightingale ceased
My trifles come as treasures from my mind :
The weight had grown beyond our strength to bear ,
To fields campanian , and held the walls
As when in evening , day and darkness strive
That wider still thy fame may spread .
Had xerophthalmia not come on .
The summertime comes , and the summertime goes --
When the sails no breeze is filling . "
To his black mouth his crooked shell applied ,
Shriek rose on shriek , -- the sabbath air
“ and duty ’s bonds my hands have tied .
Thou , that i count upon thy pity .
But never once lost sight of her .
And the dark ages suddenly return .
The flowers do fade , and wanton fields
This witness bore the saints of old
The great alonzo lies . the captive 's fate
In every breath that comes to his ears ,
With hot cheeks and sear 'd eyes
Where blooming trees their branches spread .
An ' our hearts wi ' love did beat ,
Would i could happier tidings show !
His providence extending everywhere ,
Or ever death has given him power of flight ,
The snow is almost gone ;
Fear came , and then the pride of sacrifice
Is he whose head conceived , whose hand prepared .
Ne'er old , though time passes ;
And paused where a cottage in loneliness stood .
Proof against fate in spicy urns to come ,
We coiled at ease ' neath the dripping trees
Tear falling on tear , sob following sob !
Pressed his wan and wistful face ,
Her half a league he would not have pursued .
By some whose patriot virtue has prevailed ,
Still he found three words were wanting ,
But , foodless , melancholy sit
I glared while we waited a half hour more .
Ring out the grief that saps the mind ,
That , ere the shadows of evening fell ,
The battle join 'd , the foe gave way ,
Then a defiant , ghastly face he raised ,
She turned her back , and grasped a monotone ;
Where noble thoughts and deeds should enter by :
To make of her a mansion fit
You see the reason why ,
Can not find the words of magic ,
Its width three hundred feet by measure shown .
There low he lies , in lasting rest ;
His merry pipe attunes the rural lay .
In a round error , which denied recess ;
To social cares from jarring passions freed ;
Beneath thy guidance reconciled ;
The stage the weight can scarcely bear .
Her banner it shall ride the air
Nature reigns and rules the whole ;
Whose merit dare apply it ,
Now the slender sum is told ?
Comes a vision white as a swan ,
And cattle lowing , rushing in a panic ,
That will win you a smile in return ;
Such tears she never shed before ;
Clear tokens of a heart oppressed with woe .
Thus he , with anger flashing from his eye ;
Behold thy friends are left to woe ,
One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days .
His soul hath felt to gain thy worthless heart !
That giveth me the captain of the church
Where horrid epicures debauch in blood .
The poplars held the sun , and he
Your independence to shield ?
Caught in the web of the years that pass ,
Of a great ship that steered into the stars ,
You might have spared the coming . raving spoken ,
To woeful war , by recklessness made strong .
Answer in the words which follow :
Lament its love , when wafted mild
Advancing , sowed the earth with orient pearl ,
The voices now that speak to me
And secret tears are bitter shedding ;
The old lady makes a dreadful clatter ,
( according to a form that 's set ) ,
What brave attempts for falling troy he made !
Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find ,
Our story started then . to sate their rage
And god 's slow laughter calls :
Be bound , " i added , trying
To show good humor when beset by boils ;
Ensuing , in the square was to be made .
The old hope is hardest to be lost :
That loves depart as the hours decay .
The night that covers and the lights that fade ,
And sweet sensations should have welcomed both ,
Ring out the grief that saps the mind ,
The proverb says it is a curse
Reckless of what might come at last ,
Ten hundred hundred years to rise and love ,
Unless good company be kept too long ;
Still follow fortune where she leads the way . ]
At midnight and his carnage plies : --
Is called to counsel and debate . ”
All birds and beasts lie hushed ; sleep steals away
Who bears the burning memory at her throat ,
The sorrow has come , and saddest tears
Is to existence brought ;
Till the windows speak and tremble ,
A land breeze shook the shrouds ,
Where haply , pity strays forlorn ,
Coughing a coffin brings ;
It came with the threat of a waning moon
Thy frame , robust and hardy , feels indeed
It is what the counties were made for .
That she shall fall a sacrifice
And struggled with herself , and grinned with fear
Thy light around , like his own sunshine , knows
Now wanton 'd lost in flags and reeds ,
She takes petitions , and dispenses laws ,
To wrong the wronger till he render right ;
For so the will did run .
His thoughts above all heavens uplifted were :
And i feel the chill of the depths that lie
Storm-death lifts its clawed paws ;
The flame shall feed on the fated man ,
Thin trees arise that shun each other 's shades .
Thus addressed the ancient louhi :
Were under her dominion placed .
And searching those dear eyes for human meaning ,
And , beauty dead , black chaos comes again .
To build and fix their glorious banishment .
But not from the lips that had gone before .
A bankrupt it soon would be found ,
To tread eternity .
But makes him oft repeat and piece his tale .
Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar ;
And mists ascend to the sun on high ,
Lies dark and wild , beat with perpetual storms
Whence comes this changing child ? --
As they beat the sad refrain , --
That he to quench the ill suspicion wrought ,
Of a departed brother , may be held
In angel and in god it puts no trust ;
A hundred ’s strength could overcome .
Beforehand of my thought , he made reply :
He falls , and falling bites the bloody plain .
Where lives brutus , caesar 's blood must flow ;
For treacherous peace , the freedom nature gave us ,
That neither tongue nor pen could follow it .
Yet one way remains : to the river
What terrors shivered o'er it
" shame on the tongue that breathes in tones divine
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell ,
All backward came with news of truce ;
And there dies slowly throbbing like a wounded bird .
He must instructions and credentials draw ,
Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies ;
Their annual wealth renew .
But when divinity comes cross me
Lost sheared sheep hurt her tender heart
To know that all the pains she had gone through
The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast ;
New partners have come and new faces ,
But as cover for nakedness -- guilt to relieve .
And rise again to immortality .
For the tired sun , now softly sinking down ,
Both lang and wentworth afterwards conducted newspapers
Sunshine freely falling ,
The wind-blown flame mounts the vaulted sky ,
She trod the weary round of life ,
The virtuous ring upon her finger placed ,
My heart -- my heart it leapeth
Until their term be run , and then they fall
't was union that gave liberty to all !
They played away their time at school ,
You stir the affections and wake recollections ,
Courage is left , but mated with despair ,
Now tyrants rise , once more to bind
Roaring from nether hell and filled with ice ,
A patriarch of other years appeared :
His wild veins glaring and flashing .
Whom fame affirms the semblance of the gods .
And to relieve you from this evil ,
The first great minister of india stood ,
For thus the world that peace shall find ,
Sweet loveliness , in black attired , lies .
And glad that he has gone to his reward ;
Each bound the other 's crucifix ,
All the colours turned to gravy ,
Flatly unjust , to bind with laws the free ,
Those senses , sprung as reason wholly is
Whom penance-rites have sanctified ?
Or fill with sudden tears the eyes that read .
In thee a type of man is seen ,
Sealed over a baby to strengthen some ties --
This hope still gives my body strength --
My garden was hung with the veil of spring -
Then migrate straightway into knights and commanders .
The sorrows we make to ourselves are false gods :
As if called up by love to grace
Organ and solemn service , sermon , bending priests ,
While other great ones stand , with downcast eyes ,
And through the heavens her early pathway takes ;
Fresh groves grow up , and their green branches shoot
Shall point his lonely bed .
At least that is the doctrine he presents ,
Drives blinding gales of doubt across their sun .
Whose theme is wrought of laughter and of tears
Nor sound nor motion made :
A prince the father of a people made .
And scrutinize him as he mounts the street .
Forests shall rise again where perished these ;
The earth , on whose fair bosom lay
The words leapt as a leaping sword ,
Gushed out , and deadly doom laid hold on him
That strikes into the heart of this rebellion ,
The wise , old world appears .
A gray sad land , where her girlhood grew
He gave the warnin ' , )
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice ,
Hath sat with grace these sixty years and more .
The different doom our fates assign :
And made for the ancient west highway
To place them ministers of the fifth moat ,
Which makes orrilo 's immortality .
They take their shapes and creep ,
Where our last kiss still warms the air ,
Shine forth the loving eyes we hold
We soar and sink together through the vast
They would keep her words with loving tears ,
Then , to minutest size reduced ,
Which seldom failed " from washington " to speak ;
Flowed the deep sweetness of a woman 's smile ,
Or lighting up the carvings strange and rare ,
Or peace with troy on hard conditions bought .
Though one sits stricken where its billows roll ?
So i again resorted to the lore
There he still led the singing and took part
In ancient times , as story tells ,
The murderous counsel to the queen relates .
That afternoon a sound arose of hoof
There came a wind like a bugle ;
Only a silver plectrum wakes the tone
And thus a higher goal is gained .
And paint the voice in magic numbers bound ;
And lose within thy honey 's charmed source
My rooms will receive me . but my rooms
She was taking painting lessons ,
The thing i strongly seized has turned to darkness ,
Left him , and darkness overspread his eyes .
Now have the people lost their cloak for crime :
To mourn for youth we 're not inclined ;
The way to gain domestic happiness :
Full to the bay a lordly city rose ;
It is not poetry that makes men poor ;
By wrath and bitter hate supplied .
As the swift seasons roll !
A triple mounted row of pillars laid
" she felt the fury of her ball ,
With a far-dashing stroke , and drawing deep
And enid fell in longing for a dress
When the birthday honors came ,
Give way no more to grief and gloom ,
Above him lent its grateful shade ,
Its little joys go out by one and one ,
When the struggling strength is gone ;
That the fond thought is chastened as it springs
None but dead men kept the fight .
The rose and jessamine , leaps wild in thee !
Before the few young hearts that hold
What scenes spread around her last days ,
With brow deject , the mournful vandal took
As from mere english flocks his muse can pull ,
Your charms would make me true :
Each fear that chilled their loves was past ,
Into the mist my guardian prows put forth ,
Shining in proud array , their stations hold .
His heart stood still .
But evening came , o'ershading
Steel and iron such strife may claim ;
Had turned our parish topsy-turvy ,
For which the human race keep such a coil !
Whose palms point either way ,
Lest the walk i have taken with gazing and peeping
Now do be cool and take a nap !
While seasons come and go !
With gold and flashing gems he came ,
Sweeter than lilith 's rose in eden grew --
Pride made the virtues of the pagan world .
While praising , calmed the youthful chieftain 's rage .
And make their show when hope is lost ,
As sad hearts feel when first alone with grief .
Seeing what dreadful work it leads to ;
Not the least am ' rous passion there allow ;
And with a passionate fear her mind is wrought .
A grief that never comes hath yet the smart ;
Is it to set a little blunder right ,
By sea or shore , but faced alone ,
That god is there the shadow shows .
He calls home my soul from dying ;
All served to spur their natures into storm .
From him , i first caught the sweet magical art
Whence our lives come and where they go .
And somewhere in the world his heart was breaking ;
And after following the saint and his banners ,
Still doth the file of hebrew dames proceed .
Sleep is coming soft and mild .
Than thy grim lid be closed on me .
A raw fife tickles a stupid song ,
By pity moved he can not choose but weep .
It holds like mine immortal . presently
Deathly and soft , a doom stole in .
The night was dark he 'd lost his way ;
We feared no more what the years might bring .
Nor wrought such havoc and such crimes abhorred ,
Scattered the moonlight 's smiles away .
No tearful angers torn of truthless love ,
To hold thee as the game of fools ,
You feel as in nightmares sometimes , when you slip
At many a dawn to take the forward track ,
Which me into the flames designed to cast ,
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread ,
Exalted high , and given him great renown .
But the eagle rushed against him ,
Storm , such as drove her under moonless heavens
Sweet nature appears with a tear in her eye ,
I saw the moonlight lying large and calm
But when night came with silence and the cry
By what it looked on : i can find
Sun , come down and break the dungeon door !
Where with the helmed head confined the bust .
Surges , sparkling , kissed the shore ;
When suddenly the truth did o'er me break ,
" these follow me , " the season says :
Fearful was the turmoil / that rose before the hall
But caesar 's reeked with slaughter and with guilt .
Where the water bounds the elfin land ,
Or moon or stars their wonted circles run .
And soft regret , she passed upon her way .
My wishes on my prayers take wings ,
For whom the darkness failed to mar
And the chalice filled with blood
Where the tiniest life-pulse trembled ,
In deference to their brethren , who made choice
Lest the children catch a taint ;
They push 'd before them . staggering he retired .
Drawing us near , coiling bright fold on fold ,
The flood was divided under the high heavens by holy
Till god released her of her pain ;
The clouds swing out from beyond the hills
Both house and homestead into seas are borne ,
But to show proof to all that he was god
And take the harmless folly of the time !
All vows and consecrations giving place .
Has brought thee death and endless shame .
The sacrifice , the pledges taken and given
The glorious music of the fight resound ;
Gladness and joy leaped up at every swell ;
That kissed the maiden all forlorn
No outlandish rhenish could with it compare !
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move ;
To build a city of abiding peace
Where the singers of saturn find tongue ,
The right of translation is reserved .
Through the moors i fain would reach the water —
Hope and joy his heart were filling .
By whom it grows . thus , silly girl ,
Sending joy and fragrance forth .
The hares run by me growing bold .
With pity like as fire that burned .
When the snow has gone that drifted them under ,
I should have caught the cadence of the sighs
Found peace of heart , gone gladly
Fill his heart and overflow it
Yet was his wrath not minded to obey
As a beggar he strayed and he preached and prayed
Echoed the plaudits thy own country gave .
Other pathways lead to somewhere ,
Helping me pass some otherwise long hours ;
And from the distant grange there comes
With blackness bound , and all
That word still quivered in his throat ,
The milk drawn from the mountain goat
Might catch the light of his smile so sweet ,
Which sent him , whimpering , off to jerry --
How every time with every time is knit ,
In dreary dungeons woeful scenes have passed ,
To catch at pleasures as they go ,
To break the awful loneliness
( putting aside your heartlessness
Our eyes went upward to the summit of it ,
The cause removed , habitual griefs remain ,
By quickly making one of two .
Which a grove of myrtles made ,
Sits rosy , trembling with full love for night ,
Whether clear or filled with trouble . "
Soul and sinew firmly strung --
To earth 's derisive echoes given ;
Till spirit infused to life gave birth .
A timorous thing ran the innocent hind ,
And as the veteran his task pursued ,
To-night not an old picture came ;
And powder smoke that filled the sky ,
Making observations thorough
Could melt to tears the stern and cold ,
' midst dismal darkness the black clouds were driven ,
And song goes up in flame :
My thought with eyes and wings made wide makes way
Which nowhere burns with purer beauty blent ,
But either failed to make the kingdom one .
Bad luck will surely follow !
And call on cheering hope to see
From disgrace his memory 's saved by thee ;
Evening gilds the ocean 's swell ,
The little it takes to make life bright ,
The flame of a clear-burning lamp ascended
New power shall flow through us to all ,
And give new triumphs to immortal song :
The heroic bosom beats no more !
Gentle hope will never stay
And all her winds that blow .
' to tempt the dangerous gloom ;
Gathering her brows like gathering storm ,
And sorrow wander hand in hand .
A glory sent from heaven covered him
Of the waters it should travel .
Now nine years have brought him change of joy ;
I take delight in kind to pay thee back .
May envy these the battle-scars they bring ,
That saw his triumph , saw the hero fall ;
The songs that make her grieve .
They went by chance , amid their talk ,
And i wait for my ship to come in .
The lightnings swept across the ship ,
As that sweet plant which opens every hue
Was melted by her poet 's lyric woe ,
And grief would fain the memory forego
Thy sleep makes ridiculous .
Which is to bring the fell destroyer low .
Received since they were led salvation to embrace .
Upon the chance that led him thus astray ;
Far off , i see the season
All in fairyland it chanced !
Black death attends behind the grecian wall ,
That life may bring to me .
It lifts again its spotless star .
What went before -- by way of episode ,
Is raging , and the trenches float with gore ,
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Think of the day that gave it birth ,
The past is also stored in thee ,
No more to feel the headache of my woe !
Oh , sweet youth , how soon it fades !
With sword in hand flamboyant angels surged ;
She find the one beloved name .
" and when i felt unhappy i would look
Come here to wake maternal joys ,
That hang upon their christmas pegs
Hardly had i the voice to make response ,
Such serene tidings moved such human smart .
Till other 's tongue reveal them . fervent love
Changed his cheer , and cleared his moody grace ,
A raging grief consumed my frame ,
Rising and setting , unto thee surrender
Like him that upward still sought to aspire ,
The battle winks and thuds in blundering strife .
As life itself that love-look drew :
But my sweet love no more may see .
Mohammed to a trench they bear ,
Sweet august spent the roses ' gold ,
Thou trumpet set for shakespeare 's lips to blow !
And not with horror and amazement shrink ,
Smile ever shone , 't was like the grace
Or will the vast pile o'er him pass .
A furious stroke he made .
These wings from fleeting riches , make them stay
The forest wall stood high .
With a hollow boiling voice it speaks
Through silken curtains drift again
Where everything of weight unites together ,
Beauty of white limbs that gleam
A quiet grave till doomsday rend the earth .
From each throat came liquid music ,
Tales that tumble and tales that trick ,
That those dark shades their inward guilt can hide .
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast ;
Coming on gregory wenner swept his soul
It ended , and the morrow brought the task .
Two winding sheets above it laid ;
In battles what disasters fall ,
And with such song the hollow ways were stirred
And who went the pace in england long ago .
And lull the spirit while they fill the mind ,
Give black and white an equal vote .
Let the men go to war
And fear and ignorance afford delight .
The keys committed of this lovely flower .
Glide on , in the glory and gladness sent
And that o'erwhelming honour paid ,
Thou givest us youth that turns to age ;
Might claim the breath i shape to prayer .
His work was over , his reward was come ,
Into time 's stream , may stir the tide ,
Is instant made no worth a louse ,
Hour after hour went by ; a shadow slipped
And he , while sobs his utterance broke ,
Brings the glad music closer to the soul .
Now wee make love , as all on fire ,
That all may taste the folly of their king ,
And keeps in god and man his trust ,
The writing must be letters maim 'd , that speak
Till the moon has taken flight ;
The monks to him made answer ,
The clouds are collecting to burst on your head ,
Like him , to follow new delight .
With all of desolation , that now lies
Each soul that , hitting hard and hit ,
When sweet airs come seaward
No angry hand shall rise to brush thy wings .
The branches gave them sustenance , whate'er
And all the while make harsh lament -- so here
From the shore come the scents of a garden ,
Far other aims his heart had learned to prize ,
Lay down thy wrath , and let the tranquil air
Amidst the flowers they lie ;
And overcome us like a summer 's cloud ? "
And mayest them make it better to deserve ,
And long and still the morning shadows lay
My eye explores the regions of the blessed ,
The thunder of the wrath outpoured ,
And to greet thee upward flies ,
And the storm has ceased to blow .
Meantime went zephyrus across the sea ,
Found that which fed half envy , half esteem .
Ceases not to ply his hammer ,
And , as they caught the sounds on air ,
That always must surround a diadem ,
Has spread a snowy pall .
And life can show no joy for me ;
I dreamed until the day was gone ;
Till faint from his lip a soft melody broke ,
Where the gay company of trees look down
But he who takes his cross and follows christ
There runs a sound as of the sea ;
On comfort snatched , and anguish done ,
Should give safe passage to his routed foe :
One thing you ca n't help liking about john ,
My tiresome petticoat keeps on flapping about ;
Of sin and of sorrow , to struggle above ,
Around one deeper light , revealed by law ,
The leaves dance round her with delight ,
That only brief contingencies it makes ;
The songs ascending in your praise
Those titles vanish , and that strength decay , --
The cock assumed an air forlorn ,
And slowly beat her silver wings
And then i found the sky was overcast ;
A heaven thy loving words expressed ,
That these lovely spirits bring ?
And thinks a deluge comes to drown the land ;
The cold remains of lustre gone ,
To the words the south wind said
Then , seized with giddiness and fear ,
We saw you spread leander 's sail ,
Centrale was fastened in this way .
And proudly summon 'd me to yield ,
New statutes rise , and stronger laws succeed ;
Unto the gods , and put forth things of price
Of memories that go not out of mind ;
And , covering with prisons and churches the land ,
But terror has caught us now .
The different colour 'd ranks in blood engage ,
And clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts ,
Melting on flowers as tears melt from the eye .
A blissful seat in heaven will win .
We hold because our memory is
To bend thee to thy lover ’s will .
Spice of the roses let the summer own .
There may have come a change --
And schoolward would follow the lass
That one lost chord divine ,
So fair a bride shall pass to-day !
By them the gospel is advanced
Which cruel war beats down even with the plain ,
And tears from manly eyelids fell .
We find the path to many a bright romance ,
May go as far as dreams have gone ;
Charms not like that which childhood knows ,
Is this the place where tragic armies meet ?
Till sleep had fallen on all the house .
Dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire ,
Without the joy it longed to know .
Faint with the load that on him lay ,
Such aspect wears in her bloom
Star after star they came .
Nor drew his visions down .
Meanwhile patroclus pours along the plains ,
Half frightened at this love that ran
The word that shall give me rest .
Behold the green shall find itself turned gold
Of blushes that flutter and flee
I fall thinking of that lady ,
The sun which lit that garden wholly ,
The roses first came red .
That gives the means into your power :
And never a saint took pity on
How the nipping wind does drive
Till his smile ceasing waxed compassionate
The canvas running up in a proud sweep ,
In years that bring the philosophic mind .
For i would frame a song to-day
Therefore i eager followed , and did curse
Has climbed to where the keyboard stands , --
With the low winds are blending ,
Were polished so bright they sparked in the sun .
Till fierce oppression stronger grew ,
But now being lifted into high society ,
Now stand ye forth who shall this prize dispute .
Where death and freedom found one lion 's lair ,
An ample bay , a rock the haven makes ,
Thou shalt , with more than mortal pleasures fed ,
She said , and from the fight conducted forth
March ! nor heed those arms that hold thee ,
For what remains ; let funeral flames be fed
Naked of heart , his cruel course he runs ,
A letter in the herald says some generals allow
Then since with love my prayers bear no boot ,
He brought himself to tremble in each vein .
And fruit and lotus buds that crowned
But the unrest that gave power
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment .
To give colours to the flowers ,
Now has the night her dusky veil withdrawn ,
And like proud xerxes lash the angry waves ,
Her wrath broke down , whose wrath was stubborn !
Made the wide country echo to your moan ,
Why , yet to show that thou art just ,
My rising fears , with murmuring fraught ,
Where long extended plains of pleasure lay .
The manhood that should yours resist . "
Until among them came the vision gleaming
Might not in death their spirits vex .
Has always struck me as extremely curious .
His rusty armour , took his belt withal ,
A fear of the disasters storm might bring ;
Gusts of bad air rose in a choking smother ;
Upholds the fabric that his wisdom planned ,
In time 's great periods shall return to naught ;
Brightly the joyous stream shall flow ,
From whom their power and all creation came ? "
Upon my praises following , of the eighth
Till darkness fell ; and while the other girls
I feel within my blood old battles flow --
I see no fault his fame to dim .
Each to bear a heavy burden .
And yet , when friendship sees thee trace ,
They gently sunk beneath the swelling tide .
Oh ! go to sleep , my baby dear ,
We hush our hearts and go to sleep ;
And in the hamlets that about it lie .
And to all flowers ally 'd in blood ,
So the convoy ca n't get through !
As autumn suns shed round them when they set .
To leave the flagging spirit doubly weak ;
The clock struck one ,
Onward they traced the wide and lonesome main ,
To quench thy thirst , we offer thee
Follow your captains , crown your kings ,
There very weeping suffers not to weep ;
I 'd pluck every thorn from your path in life
In front of these came addison . in him
To-morrow the last flowers are blown .
So through his river mine shall reach thy sea ,
One dimple in those rose-cheeks hid ;
What terrors shook his frame ! )
All the leaves listen upon all the bushes ,
The figures hunched with pain ,
Of rain that sobs through thorn and pine
The angel spread his wings in flight .
Through all the long green fields has spread ,
May health and fortune on thee smile .
The day shall come , that great avenging day ,
O merry maids who shared our cheer ,
About his altar , handling holy things ,
To win that day had come .
It sent before their time . "
For horror hath not ceased to overwhelm
And lengthening veins absorb the refluent flood ;
The great blessing of heaven descends not in rain .
In benediction loud he raised
Sore my heart would rue .
Low bows his head when jesus meets his ears ,
Full many a cup of joy may flow ,
To be fit when the day should come !
But found the pois ' ning scenes of riot
They bring to life things good and new .
Serves well her modest blush to cover ;
By me , who the wreath has made .
Against one champion moved for love of me ,
With honest pride the gift i take ,
The appetite remains , that this is ask 'd ,
Within an age of doubt kept clean your faith ,
Which few pence had made too dear
Society , grown weary of the load ,
Gathering its strength up to pursue the race ;
Where they like swallows coming out of time
" this form confesses whence it came ;
No slightest shade of fault i see ,
Perhaps would make provision for his wife
A wreath reflecting of eternal beams .
Where knots of trembling cowslips bow 'd .
So beautiful , came foul and-twenty elders ,
Or to the boats the baggage bore .
Then with expanded wings he steers his flight
That nods beside the fire .
That turns for spiritual vision on itself ;
With the sixth azzo whom all virtues love ;
That madness pens , or folly sings .
Musician , with the lifted resolute face ,
A broad and smiling valley lay : --
Swift through the air the missile sang :
A petal falls from the dreamland rose .
All other names is given .
To the churchyard forth they bear ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
My heart leaped up with untold joy ,
To bid them come aboard , and take such rest
Was filled with indignation bitter :
He took the tide of fortune at the flood ;
She twines around each kindred heart ,
The jury takes the part of polly ,
Goth hom to take avisement :
New gathered , and ambrosial smell diffused .
Weak man whose days are quickly told .
_ we should be dazed and terror struck , _
The soft eyes thrill , the silent footsteps glide .
The pigs can see the wind . '
Light as a flower fell ,
To brush with sweet eclipse the morning star ,
They flung among the patriots of shannon shore .
And that thou put me not to further speech ,
The sadness that came suddenly
Old honoured tales that earth may tell to me ,
Ere these hills own night 's dark sway ,
What mournful faces peopled the sad night ,
This happy day with acclamations greet ,
Of your bright beauty which is yet to come .
Beside the bed where parting life was laid ,
Mourn the keep-sake thou hast broken ?
Made much of his dread malice vain .
Old glory fairly shouts my way :
The snows lie thick around us
Mutely the door slides sullen in the stone ,
Where the jaws of death stand open ,
It fell about the martinmas tyde ,
Still further lay our threatened death behind ,
Widening knowledge surely brings
Had melted , and fresh winds began to blow ,
And , with rage growing wild ,
The walk round the homestead close followed by rover ,
Darkness shall wrap , as it had never been .
All my dreams of bliss are flown ;
The blazing fire , and forth there came
Their souls were scattered and their blood was shed ,
The man that brought the challenge proud before .
Like sorrow came upon me , heavier still ,
All creatures which the wide world held .
Such cunning art cymosco would assay :
Sir rat went on , nor stayed
This loose abandoned slang spilled all around ,
Thou gentle stream , soft circlets weaving ,
And rises late and carries his head low .
And overhead the wandering ivy and vine ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Their setting hour of darkness had not seen ,
And you whom distant nations send to war !
Deeply sunk in thought , he cries ,
Give greater pleasure and less pain
His glory made the heavens afraid ;
The ransom of this one poor life shall pay .
My master made reply , " to be tormented ;
The object of mistaken satire make ;
Scared at the cry the startled mother gave ,
What discord drowns sweet music 's feast !
Like to a baleful doom which bringeth down
That virgin bloom where blushes went and came
An order from a thousand bugles tossed ,
The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds
With clouds that curl in purple and pearl ,
" to the northward stretched the desert ,
Which held so long that ancient pair in peace .
To bearded lips , while eye spoke unto eye .
Seem 'd as all nature struggled to expire .
It never rests till meeting face to face ;
" empty words will break no portals ,
With lips that brim with laughter
How the rest of the alphabet brings up the rear
His blighted prospects did not make him sad .
A different figure one would make .
As north from south -- the impulse felt before ,
Ere seven years came about .
A little voice that one day came
For the sweetest hours are the ones that bring
Melting she passed into the mind ,
Let the old life be covered by the new :
At once the cornel rattled in the skies ;
Hard fate will not allow ;
To yield you the office you still maintain ?
Sinks all dissolving into pleasure 's dream ,
At ruddle 's and take warning .
And to whom i was like to give offence .
Thick darkness o’er the sun was spread .
To catch the rippling rain , --
Long as there lingers gloom to chase ,
The happy dreams that gladdened all our youth ,
He gave you breath and life , and will again
But lead me privately , so that the world
And by degrees from underneath it came
And when she cast her eyes on the afflicted ,
Then followed tears , -- like autumn rain .
Where the flowers sleep in the perfumed breeze ;
Reduced to crave the good i once could give :
Low at her feet a wealth of flowers lies ;
The tide comes in . the moonlight flood and glory
The curse was fallen now . and cried she through
" what counsel give ye touching those i kept ,
The fires that over sodom fell
He gave the ring that bore his name ,
Thy mournful destiny we sorrow 'd o'er ,
It made me grow all cold and pale ,
His form , dilating , swelled and rose .
Into the arms of joy could leap .
Its melancholy , long , withdrawing roar ,
Dogged by the living ; till it reached
O'er the broad vessels rolls the swelling tide :
There , like a fallen star , the dame
Wherewith they made his cerement wet ,
One single form thy majesty displayed .
By malison of theirs is not so lost
I shall not see another day .
When all the valley followed after kysh
Thou owest ! not alone these swelling tears ,
Whate'er they take they can restore
Catch the gleam of sunny hair .
Than youth conceal 'd in thine .
Had wasted rudely her once flowerlike form ,
With terror that stops still the blood .
And every flower that sad embroidery wears :
Feeling content to leave them all ,
When proud gomorrah reared its head
In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast .
Like acceptation from the world will find .
Then came the bitter , sudden change ,
And thus with gentle words address ’d the god :
Seeming now to draw to land ,
Has not more chance for eating up a man ?
The cry of lamentation now spread so far around
Shall find a doom for many . had the star
So keen the panting of his heart ye hear .
Abide the issue , she her choice shall make ;
Where lightnings fiercely play around ;
I feel myself quietly falling in love .
A light that sings along the waves of light ,
The sun runs round and the rain is wet
With increasing daylight the sentinel takes a sheltered position ,
So long delays her flowers to bear ;
In comes the playmate that never was seen .
The work will stand , and not disgrace ,
And we by faith see glory shining through
A hundred years have passed since first the order
In fierce theatric battles hackt and torn ,
Of beauty buried in the dark . and hers
And truths that had seemed very far , revealed themselves
Now , matthew , let us try to match
That kept it all so still ,
The mighty wood , with pomp , receives
And must i lose what would have been delight ,
Nor had he else preserved his honour clear :
They seek a god again !
Henceforth no credit give ;
From the homestead went in sorrow ,
This drew from phylacus his noble line ;
Affect no honour but what she can give ;
Who to the maiden ’s marriage come ,
Of treasures rare , of joys that thrill ,
A purer , vital heat shot from the sun
Thy loving hands will set
Whose staff folded my thoughts before my birth ,
They keep me from all sin and error grave ,
But , looking still on her , i stand amazed
Within her eyelids sate the swelling tear ,
With joys along their course to shine ,
Those sadnesses which speak the heart 's desire ;
Sweep thy rooms and make them cheery ,
Lured from heaven by her dreamy blush ;
Whose tender heart for woe can feel ,
To make them thereby mindful of their own
Here i pass a happy life .
Great glad mouths open and fair cheeks made red
My weak heart sees spectres ,
From north to south the flaming fluid ran ;
There let the music that 's sweeter than words
They move through heaven 's ethereal blue ;
Thus , thus we live , and spend the hours
The vision is gone , the splendour faded ,
And the waves beat , and the winds roar ,
I heard a rose that murmured from her pot :
In the summer just passed over ,
Out from her toes the scrawling roots were sent
Where the tamil and malay tell their lore
The flowing arteries of trade .
True love , long sought and found at last ,
For me , my heart that erst did go
What means this stately tablature ,
Exclaiming , drew me towards him from the place ,
Dusk dawn in heaven still strives with daylight clear
Shall we deny the journey 's gathered lore --
Give him emotion , though pain !
A swarm of arrows singing to the mark ,
Cheering his men , and spreading deaths around :
Earth builds upon earth castles and towers ,
My pathway leads to palestine .
The life that has long gone by .
The classic ode of days gone by , --
Into faint sunshine ; there the ivy hangs
That never sailing on its waters saw
Till pride had made her eyes grow bright ,
White flowers fell as the night wind blew .
With little seamanship ; and comes a gale ,
Once vague and lost to me ,
Of aventine spread oft a lake of blood .
Our hearts eternal truth in silence swore ;
To give the feather 'd arrow wings to kill ,
To me high favour have ye shown ;
It is true pleasure -- there is seen
For faith leans thoughtful in a place of graves ,
And away for ever their grief they cast .
She heard the torrents meet .
And threat to break the thread by force ;
Not to court perils that honour could miss .
It made him very sad to think
He fell into a rage of wrath ,
Laden with flower and fruit , whereof they gave
All the simple faith has gone
The wild horse flies from the hurricane ,
His soul to see a higher plan
We have reined the lightning , probed the flower :
With god 's people take your place ,
Methought the world was bound with final frost ;
With eyes of envious hate had seen
Which ne'er may discharge the magnificent debt ?
What promise of morn is left unbroken ?
An era will come , to begin its career ,
While twelve thy steps attend .
And raising hands of reverence said
Grim is the face that looks into the night
How came they to be --
There goes my ink ! )
Man from vitality ; these bleed within ;
But with that peace the power to act returned ;
A sigh or tear can not that boon impart ,
Beyond was made a sea , whose azure flood
Then smitten by the shafts that came
The sea whose faith naught else can shake ,
For certain sorrow brings
To which those rustics rude shall make pretence .
And to bear witness of that blessed light
Would of his death read some newspaper mention .
Nor turned her face of dread ,
Quick ! proceed to the proof ! " --
Which leads to where she 'll meet again
Albeit such grace and passing sweetness shewed
And fast the flames roll 'd on .
But hating lies , the simple truth will tell ,
The wind blew from the south ;
Dalica most , who thus her aim pursued .
These earlier signs they give that presage doom .
Her distress would leave us rueing :
Nor double the pangs i sustain ?
The nightingale that in the branches sang ,
Only the snow can reach her as she lies ,
His feathered shaft , that through the flowing air
By charms within a ring confined .
" what makes the oak-tree grow
In despair he casts askance
O'er karl the flood of sorrow swept ;
As the days went rolling onward ,
The royal nymphs approach divinely bright ;
Feeling it break , with bleeding groans they pine ,
But the time came of famished hours ,
Can save thy heritage and confirm that power
The loveliest form she e'er gave birth .
Each wind brings sad alarms .
The wealth that a world could offer
The garb of the highlands is mingled with blue ,
That comes from nonconformist purses .
Less for the flowers than what the flowers convey ,
" and evening hush broken by homing wings , "
Had bared his barren beauty to the moon ,
When rhymes came fast and blood beat clear ;
And to their feet the congregation bounded .
And sank me in despair and misery ,
I come once more to touch the hand that reached
Sweet hue of eastern sapphire , that was spread
And shows your lack of history and reflection ;
Where the fishing fleets put in ,
And casements fronting magic meres .
And the inner voice speaks out :
While april in the lilacs stirred ,
That gained will not leave grief behind ,
Of my young heart came laden with rich prize ,
And , while they past , a fragrance threw ,
A carnival gladdens the hills in june ,
And purple thistles upward thrust ,
We get the secret in a thousand years ,
Olivier too lies stretched ; nor has retrieved ,
Love spread his purple pinions wide ,
And open up the gates of prescience .
Love in a shower of blossoms came
The moaning wind went wandering round
I knew my home where i had choice to feel
The dust replaced in hoisted roads ,
To lay that field of princely virtue waste ,
Too blindly have reposed my trust ;
Turn on the poet 's eyes
Dishonour must have followed and disgrace ;
The beauty that shall never die or pass : --
This horror never born of thee . "
Above herself : and then there came the thought ,
Came thither where that foaming river ran ;
How fair an entrance breaks the way to love !
As if they had caught the purple hues
Added a charm , was passed confuting .
To bathing rites themselves addressed ,
Our plighted vows to heaven are flown ;
As the tide comes tumbling in .
And teach the fiery mischief where to fall .
Now thereby , ladies , hangs a tale ,
Beheld the poet 's awful form arise :
_ tears will spring where woes are deep _ .
Would i could freight ye with such spirit power ,
She leaves to better worlds all finer clay .
Though the night was made for loving ,
Together we have spent such days and years ;
Those shades imploring , went beneath a weight
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow ,
In vain , for time does them efface ;
Is living in the life they lead .
The third and fourth deduc 'd we see ;
Had often wrought some fury on myself ,
Exist by nature , nor were wrought with hands
Was all the stronger circled by romance .
And my cheeks shall have lost their hue ?
And evening on its darkness fell
The flowers that the forests hold
When shepherds homeward lead their tinkling flocks .
Our witnesses arise . ours is the truth ,
Whom it was that venus led --
The wind sprang up before the knight would cease .
That much of comfort could not there be found ,
And the slime lies naked , like a thing ashamed
Into thy footprint flows the indwelling wine ;
The clouds have begun to frown ;
Pressing hands and whispering passion ,
Since father adam set the human pace
His faithful followers , highest honour give ;
Not questioning why they knelt , feeling in thee
Which makes thee wonder ; and so purge the cloud
All daylight wanting to disperse the gloom :
All eyes take one direction , for he comes ,
The lash take thou , and the resplendent reins ,
Of lowly life , and make it great ,
O health , why make me inhabit heaviness ? --
While perfumed beauty danced in sinuous robes ,
A son with victories that wear
Along the path that winds the wave beside ,
Be filled with praise .
And oft , as evening fell ,
There came a sudden tiny puff of smoke --
While these lays and incantations
Active it finds , to its own substance draws ,
To panchavaṭí took their way .
But when the music paused , he ceased to shed
Ere the shadows of night come drooping down . --
" when beauty 's streaming eyes her woes express ,
To shake the faith of tipperary !
A fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery
And the fixed reward will give thee . "
Wrapped in the view of ages that are passed ,
Could wake a dream , more soothing or sublime ,
For blasts would rise and rave and cease ,
Breaking all their hearts for me ,
And all but i get tidings of their friends ;
And everyone came back to common sense ,
He held his peace ; and godfrey answered so :
Shall lie within his ken .
The name , that springs forever in my breast .
That they had met resistance , i could see ,
Or prose or verse it glows like burnished gold ;
So romantic , and makes such a noise
Thus leads you wandering in the silent night ? "
So high that all the virtues there did come
O let the blissfull heart hold it fast
And i forgive the wrongs that live ,
Saw good things altered and old friends fare forth ,
Whoso goes to war for nothing ,
I had not buried then so many hopes !
These powers enfold the greek and trojan train
It will make thee tall and queenly ;
Clouds when they intercept our sight ,
He held his dialogues ! and they did teach
The music that tuned it is o'er ;
Innocent lives to make them foully dead !
And meet its changes as they come ,
The story off by saying : it was hopeless ,
Where the pale cloudlets fly ,
While the other sweeps the waters .
Ask of this fragment , reared by roman hands ,
( a pastime little found to thrive
Began the sorrows that i feel even now .
Confounded , thetis in her bosom hid .
They make a yell , retreat , and fly :
Their naked branches swing ;
That only serves to make us grieve
A great white silence has descended and sits
No gospel has come down that cures
Driven by the frenzied prophetess of troy .
Where time is lost and no life gleams .
The giant king his mandate gave :
As present shift allowed . and sudden stress
Following the flag ,
And gifts in turn , confirming friendship , gives .
It will not lead through solitudes
As fate allows but seldom here ;
For thousands serve a monarch ’s will ,
That rose still higher o'er the wavy brine .
To pulp before i go to sleep !
Down his own the tears begin to run .
Thy watery columns squirted to the clouds !
Have unaware stood in your royal presence .
An odour leaves behind ,
And with her magic singing kept she --
Angry grew and cried for vengeance ;
Since she got her annuity .
I feel that it might say unto the blind :
To see love coming and see love depart .
My home went waste for lack of care ,
O'er hill and dale their azure hues revealing ,
To torture self , or come at power to hurt
Although the soul seemed shaken as it prayed . )
Time in its ruthlessness has willed
Which led where the eye scarce dared follow
And settles in season his worldly affairs :
A fiery day dawned in the window , shook
Reeling along the path he held his way .
And troy sends forth one universal groan .
Never rise from the level of " turf " .
Joy may come as some master plays !
To give you comfort as you think ,
Renewed the furious battle , fight and fray ,
Alone enabled thee some griefs to bear .
Icy chill was daphne caught .
Dies sighing where it rose
Answered in the words which follow :
I 'm filled with longing more and more ,
Purple dust sifting through fingers of ivory :
The miracle of life should ever pass
The truest scotland ever knew .
And all my love was so absorbed in him ,
And pure as psyche ere she grew a wife --
This made owd nick fair raging mad ,
With all its tender foliage meets the ground
And fought with rage incessant
It drank beneath his orient eye ,
Turns , and forth stretches eager for the food ,
Sweet love has laid his hand across my eyes .
They spend their mornings baking cakes ,
Over what monsters night extends her reign :
The waters babble as they run --
By oracles of blackness barred .
And the great sea opened and swallowed pain ,
Shivering to meet the light ; and millions pray ,
Which the dripping o ' dew drags down .
Could have brought forth so beautiful a birth ; --
It filled my soul with a love divine .
Realize now what the terrible thunder meant .
No mouths to feed or coat to mend ,
He saw that the malice of satan was pressing ,
The soul to whom that love was given
Of paler fire , that plant that swings
But i read the truth of your noble heart
Shall die and leave his errand unfulfilled .
On which account our story made a halt ,
Who holds by everlasting law
The saffron morn , with early blushes spread ,
And lifts its plumes of pride
Count ganelon his own house seeks , to make
Deep silence spread her gloomy wings around ,
What helps one 's beauty , youthful blood ?
This can unlock the gates of joy ;
To the rippling song of gladness from the
So mixed with pain ,
( the following lists include poetical works only )
It admits honest laughter , and needs honest tears .
To breathe the scent of lavender and rose ,
And the leaves stirred ,
Have taken much lately to whispering in doorways ;
Still calling on his lost patroclus ' shade .
And says in him thy fair appearance lies .
Nor from those appetites sustained annoy ,
Achilles closes with his hated foe ,
Victorious he his mighty triumph holds ,
Those over whom false fortune 's wheel had rolled ,
Which chilled the trembling foe with fear
Where guilty spirits feel eternal pain ;
And , seeking , found but grief and pain .
The air lies hush 'd above the peaceful roof ,
If it be morn or evening to discern .
That spring came on forever , "
Now is my fearful judgment felt ,
You strung to melody the grecian lyre ,
Who with his fear is put beside his part ,
Fill the golden hours with gladness ,
To him that hath shall more be given .
And goodness which make very youth .
Lighter every test goes by ;
Not only cures patients but makes 'em so merry ,
Its glimmer borrowed from the grove or porch ;
Into the rising surges of the pines ,
Still through decaying ages as they glide ,
Half breeze , half spray , came whistling by .
To join thy loved -- that happy band
My mamma ca n't help cry ,
Thus to make thee free and useful ? '
To him , the shepherd folds his flocks .
The later sleepers , where the garden lies ,
I wonder 'd why all thy complaints were made ,
For time means tucker , and tramp you must ,
And a hurt is made well by a kiss .
The keyhole wandered through .
Splitting in rage the edges
Bleeding with thorns of petty strife ,
Her fanfares echoing still their wild applause ,
The world and its giving belonged to him .
Cast his eyes upon the sunrise ,
In tears to find her solace , and to love
These trees -- a veil just half withdrawn ,
Leading the pack of the passions followed .
Of sacrificial fires burst their rings
According as the skies their shadows threw .
And gave to her each youthful joy so tender .
They will follow thee and slay thee ,
And the moonlight , stormy striven .
In peace unless their sins are washed away
It tore off the scales from the eyelids
Sprinkles its swell with blossoms , and lays forth
The answering cheers of plebs and senate rolled
Of a lighted instant and have it gone . "
Some manly scion may conceal . "
And wonders kindly come to pass
My heart has lain in a golden muse ,
_ his soul shone from his eyes and laid _
Will rise in each eye ,
Old hate revived upon rinaldo 's side ;
And golden carp in the shadows flashed ,
To wind his fond arms round his gentle bride .
The translator turns it thus :
Their wails o'er the wilderness passed ;
But fell as love would scorn to fall !
Arriving where the thracian squadrons lay ,
And flashing up , with the blush that flushed
As many miles aloft . that fury stayed --
The eager ring of beaters closing in
Thus joyful troy maintain ’d the watch of night ;
The name should keep or hide from view .
The freshness shall wither and fade like the grass ;
All hearts still follow 'd , as you flew ,
Mixes , though even to greece we run ,
And earth receives her sacred gift of sleep .
It caught like fire the main ,
Nor streamlet whispered from its hidden source ;
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
Which answers me -- yet leaves me wondering still ,
He 's soft and tender , pray take heed ,
The rites have waited long . " the chief commands
Tears pass away
The shadows kissed her woe-worn face ,
While joys above my mind can move ,
An ancient crier through the village passed ,
And the clouds began to gather ,
The thoughts that arise in me .
The farthing went for water ,
Shouldst keep our father ’s promise true :
Is making fearful havoc in our host ,
And thus we lost our paradise !
There comes just now this happy thought --
Then deep below , where orchards show
The desultory numbers ; let them stand ,
" whence comes achilles ' pity for the greeks
The future tenour will to thee unfold . "
There goes my dinner bell ! i hear it saying
Keeping that respite gratefully in mind .
Desires are barren and tears yield no fruit .
The frailties which a friend makes known ;
Which follows soonest on the sin ;
That voice which rises unto god ,
For pain and anguish thrown aside ,
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
Touched with the sad and sorrowful scene ,
Making self-merit of the antique worth
And drive these sinful thoughts away .
" love for the virtue which attended me
Into their breast my soul they take ,
But shadows ever man pursue .
That ever with a frolic welcome took
And thousands poured to heaven the pitying sigh devout ;
Like to a moving vintage down they came ,
( sprung from a race whose rising blood
The tear-stained eyes where the shadow lies ,
Over the conflict vaguely hovering --
To face the sea-wolf 's leap .
When , his pulse failing , passion speechless lies ,
The gray old ash that so bravely stood ,
I leave my heart behind me .
Calm as a full cloud resting on a hill ,
Tears , of cockatrices shed :
The joyous tidings found their way .
And proud creusa to the temple led ;
And my wisdom-songs find welcome . "
I summon up remembrance of things past ,
Shall , in the vengeance it dispenseth , find
Until at last a whisper passed :
And of those words your full avengers make ?
Worth being rich to hold in fee .
Hers is the beauty that no man shall share .
All the adventure of the night made known ;
The flame that burst from out the sheen
Left dry the yellow shore . onward it came ,
Visions of very heavy meals arise
The great hierarchal standard was to move ;
And thanks and praises seem 'd to run
These serve him in his days of joy
Wondered if any life lay locked in thee :
As coroner merival took evidence
I miss him while gather the shadows of night ;
That glided through your gloomy hall .
Of charm the laws of nature keep ?
To drive the cold winter away .
Abide the lowering tempest , when a day
Not once she paused her breath to take ;
Still surging dark against the christian bound
It makes us weep to want it overmuch ,
Was filled with pride and happiness ,
Badge of thy faith calls back thy care ,
To show her sunshine _ has _ been there .
The queen of speech her richest blessings shed ;
The hours i spent with thee , dear heart ,
In its most ravishing sweetness rudely broken .
Reached king valdemar , the imperious ,
And the flood of their doom went flying ,
And rough furze crept along the ground .
And the mane shall swim the wind :
Making thee feel thyself a man with men .
And arrogance well recommends them ;
As mountains wear them ; and you never wore
That aims to trace the secrets of the skies ;
“ save that a golden bow the goddess bears ;
There only stayed . one army struck -- their foes
And , oh , the joy he spreads .
The mournful region lies a naked waste .
And thus it chanced one winter 's night ,
The one that touched my youth --
A thousand petty cares arise each day
Nature 's hush 'd giants stood to guard and girth
With the doctrines that i here conceal .
Their eyes that red with lust of vengeance burn :
Ah , let him wake ! the moments fly :
To cheer the lonely , lift the frail ,
When may calls forth a thousand flowers
Half is mine , although i follow ;
Crying , slip thy scales , and slough !
And he spoke the words which follow :
The scar that renewed our woe .
His proud lips lifting up with scorn , --
And hearken what the frightful sounds convey .
And into our thought there come the journeyings
Around thee weaving their mysterious chain ?
Earth and heaven went past them
And the dire curse was fallen alonzo 's doom .
Dispenses , when she takes her daily round
Comes the painter mixing soul-tints
Wide hills lay silent in the sun ,
My days go on , while false hours prophesy
Who call and take some favourite tome ,
A-musing as he onward went ,
The green whey rises separate .
Bowing and laughing when breezes blow free ;
To let the employee sheer starvation shirk .
Tears on my mustache are rolling .
With the strong foe , and to abandon hope .
Our lips found words scarce sweet enough ,
Till the last dear companion drops smiling away ?
As faithful characters he drew
The substance and the light of her have fed
Why didst thou fail to give the alarm ,
Lang may she stand to prop the land ,
With wisdom 's followers has taken part ;
The latter half of the quotation runs thus --
So graced the sunshine of that day .
She slept that we might take pleasure .
With fortune ’s favouring signs , addressed :
The cradle and the coffin bound its ends ;
By those fair bodies that its splendour pressed .
In britannie was none to match with mee ,
And in their tortured eyes i stand forgiven .
But the strains still arise
Loving the things that their fathers wrought --
The fountain that runs by philosophy 's shrine ,
And theirs who follow thee , what time thy bark
First heard , or in its future issue shown .
Of mighty shadows , whose dim forms despond
Adown her cheek a salt tear stole ,
She puts the period often from his place ,
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds ;
Will serve to keep the world thy friend :
There harmony and love reside ,
That we wash our hearts , and hands .
Till wisdom give the sacred nine ,
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes .
Nothing that can dim your blue eyes
And the stranger thy birthright hath taken .
Who lightest holds his life .
Over the bluish-black fields softly passes ,
Breast and breath sank .
Which down from fiesole came long ago ,
To him , that laid her cherished husband low .
Away to the sky-line stretching far --
Frosts that bite or winds that blow !
Like him whose fetters dropped away
Such power to guilt was given .
Wild fury in his bosom woke ,
An ' bore fraternal greetin 's
Of fancy rise full springing : but not mine
In feeling which , the bosom felt
Trembled and seemed as it would melt away ,
Wise poets , that wrapped truth in tales ,
Their chaos of confusion came --
Of the true city should discern the tower .
Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view .
Which makes me for to weep .
When peaceful folk in beds lay snug asleep :
In sorrow sung love 's lore .
To follow a new spouse , while i remain
Desire what here no spells can raise .
Which no commiserate pity came and cloaked ,
The loveliness that shone in spain .
All that the human heart most fears or feels ,
A widow ’s crushing hour of woe .
And a magic spell on my spirit was cast ,
For turning europe 's rabid war dogs loose ?
Has cast its sombre shade ;
And rolling billows them bore to the coast
Impious and harmful , bringing woes to all ,
To seek adventure 's thrill .
There the bees went for honey ,
Answered in the words which follow :
And a strange music went with him ,
Reality as a mirage when port is made .
On which a shattered rainbow hung ,
That skirts the ocean 's foam ;
And a lump stood in his throat .
Protects her , and her courage hath revived .
When he had dropped asleep again , i rose
Of summer meadows dancing on the grass ?
Not made by dying , mortal hands .
Comes the song of woodland bird .
The enormous faith of many made for one ;
But the entrance is made straight ,
Will he take back that strength he has given ,
Then raised his voice upon the storm and prayed .
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
Flecked with fleecy clouds that blow
Or what does he regard his single woes ?
In whom she put her trust ,
And all that may come in another way
And bid the lost affections live again .
A pleasant alpine valley lies beautifully green .
And call on hell his soul to burn !
Had lost , and sadly missed her love .
To open and let out the resurrection .
The shell-strewn beach that edged the main ,
Leaped into the blossomed grass ; the echoes rolled
Where love runs wild ,
This job completed , spring work next came on ,
Where some bold river breaks the long expanse ,
Thus on each part the sinners stood , but soon
Some dark cloud seemed to hang upon the day ;
To love ulysses is to raise thy hate .
Which holds together the rotten remains .
Banish the darkness filled with quivering dread ,
Giving their impatience vent ,
My toils rewarded , and my woes repaid ;
As it declared , and not for crime committed ,
The morning broke -- the storm had fled ,
Our prayers had made the unchanging yield .
Is made to bear the mortal blast ,
The poor and troubled source from which they flow ;
Bring less of bloom than in days gone by ?
A heart that can feel for another 's woe ,
And , to bring good fortune , seven fairies
Thy spirit met us there ,
Or put any ' fake ' on his brand ,
“ how lovely pampá ’s waters show ,
If half be true that legends tell .
Two golden talents for the fourth were placed :
One property reserved to christ ?
Now came still evening on , and twilight gray
The pity for herself she felt in him ,
And ye , who hold the post of fame ,
Where we devote our life to prayer and praise .
For its love to thee belongs .
Had leafy shrines where fires of worship glowed .
I charge thee by the solitude he kept
The merry children keep their glee ;
With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels . '
Nor great achilles , stained with gore ,
Now take your fill of love and glee ,
Why he put the skin side outside .
That hangs before her all the year ,
History reares her pyramids , more tall
The future only holds thee and can hold thee .
Do come those particles which make the clouds
And the landscape flowed away behind ,
The powers of all subdued by thee alone ,
The lessons love can read me . " yet again
Old age -- which few of us attain --
But she the threatening future could only thus unfold ;
Such wondrous power god to his saint will lend ,
By taking this road that inclines to the right
The pity of the snow that hides all scars ;
He brought , as the high sun brings ,
We are what your lips have made us ,
Out of ulster came o'donnell ,
Peace of heart flowed from his music ;
So clanged the prologue of the battle . as
The south wind brings wet weather ,
That common bane of greece and troy i found .
Of words unuttered that breathed and stirred .
The wound , which you yourself have made ;
" since heaven commands it ( ajax made reply )
But toys to give my heart some ease ;
Lacking his power , we shared his dream
To take this vengeance for her wrongs .
But the sky struck him speechless , and he tried
Nor can contain his furious spirit more .
Enlightenment each day shall rise
Her voice makes perfume when she speaks ,
The waves lie still and gleaming ,
Haste now , philosopher , and set him free .
While passed the sighing breeze along her breast .
Thy skiff bounds swiftly in the race ,
And note what an average graveyard contains .
In pomp sits mercy seated in her face ,
Sleep of such visions shaken .
They held to be rank blasphemies . "
I wait its close , i court its gloom ,
No wind came now , blowing from flowery shores ,
To bring on useless tears , and dismal recollection .
Till dizzied with the sight she fell asleep .
And of those words your full avengers make ?
And make mad speeches ; though i know the bent
Have lost the scent that charmed of old .
Dazzled by sun and drugged by space they wait ,
The rain and the dew for thee took care ;
Seeing no farther than his lust .
The roar of baleful battle rose ,
Away from fools i 'll turn my eyes ,
That feels how shyly daisies grow ,
That year in killingworth the autumn came
That drew patrons to his mart ,
Nor for he swelled with ire was she afraid ,
And sorrow rends the earthy covering .
A guard was set that he might not flee --
Would dash in mist around him , and in fear
To reach phaeacia all thy nerves extend ,
Have prayed his curse to rest on you !
And for the soul an ample passage made .
Winter would follow ?
Or thin defense , they pour their forces there .
The snowdrops had regained their lovely charm ;
Stories of things a long while come to pass :
And springs ran nectar , honey dropped from trees .
Whence jarring discord hath assail 'd it thus ? "
To shine the broughton of game cocks ,
The martial drum had banish 'd fear ,
They ring the tune of enderby !
To cover an erring race .
On evil shapes it fell forsooth :
The moonbeams trail their shrouds ;
My childhood 's earliest thoughts are linked with thee ;
Never gave the enraptured air ) ,
Had never lived , or left the malt alone ,
There never came a luckier chief :
With fitful lights and shadows blending ,
Ye rising race , consider well
There like a gloomy cloud that flies
All thought in munich centered on the part
Are farthest spread , these woful tidings flew .
Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell ,
Towers and battlements it sees
And coloured only by its truthfulness ;
Nor our mirth be stirred at his solemn looks ,
Seeking the pleasure of their lord ,
At the dawning of morning must go ,
An aged woman presented to tarquinius superbus three books
English dramatic poetry that has appeared since browning
And seasons plumed with light or night ,
For thy love has made us free .
It only loved to be there .
Find eternal peace in pain ?
Saw starlight flashing from bare cutlasses ,
When sunlight made the wind-white water blaze .
On his sad soul a heavy burden lies
Has passed its noon ,
In gilded barges went the female train ,
Imperial sway no more exalts my mind ;
And feel a blest assurance he was there !
To aid the screechings of distracted night .
Feed the heart of the night with fire .
Parforce the felon 's spirit would expell .
Under cliffs that tear the blue ,
Which bride and bridegroom shall together hold !
It should not bring amazement to thy face . "
The airs that hover in the summer-sky
Beat back the shades , beat down the woe ,
How dare we crush the blossom of our life ?
Comes now to mind a favorite scene
To join his rapid coursers for the fight :
For glad amazement , mixed with some dark fear ;
Be turned to mourning ? --
And the flames shot up to heaven ,
These scenes so deeply stained with sorrow 's dye ?
" give me joy that in his name
The saffron-mantled morning now was spread
The which in such balance lay ,
Around , but gave to view his brawny thighs
His hands as aspens tremble , whilst they raise
Stung by a thousand wrongs , at length arose
A poison 'd , swollen form it lay . }
Tuned by faith 's ear to some celestial melody .
Who followed christus thought that he was god .
Christ keep us from such fantasy ! " --
That came in dying echoes up the aisle ,
Turned the lord with comfort , saying :
Upon that grasping power , that selfish pride ,
And on our day of death each day reflect .
I gave him seven talents of wrought gold ,
That rays of light might render more forlorn
The faith they owe ; when earnestly they seek
Love within his heart must dwell
Shun or too devoutly follow .
Leans to accompany the tranquil air ,
Death now had borne me to my doom .
To execute their valiant enterprise :
And bids his envoys their success relate .
The rule holds good since the world begun --
So when light clouds on airy pinions sail ,
The presence and the waft of death go forth
The crimson stains bear witness of its spring ;
The terrified land-loodles flee .
Had let proclaim a tournament -- the prize
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew ,
And in his friendship men found happiness . "
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me
Nor cared that beauty stood in mutual eyes ;
Looks o'er proud property , extended wide ;
Shall melt the snaws of age ;
Raved of the wrongs she had suffered since her
That formed and marked my soul .
Through the brave bay state 's pulses leap
Holds their desire aloft , and hides it not .
One lesson which in every wind is blown ,
Laughing at life and the world they sought her ,
His goodly spirit should move forth , returning
He felt a pensive calm , sweeter than sleep ,
Of thine immortal rule . fain would i see ,
The rosy heights came out above the lawns .
Who being stout , gave mony a clout ;
Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed ,
But the jury were shaken a little when gore
And on feast-days two demanded .
Hath laid her babe to rest ;
When the sabbath eve shafts down
Like a huge organ , rise the burnished arms ;
Each man seeks it a different way
Where love in depth of shadow holds his throne ,
Glory doth follow , courage goes before ;
Anger became me -- made my colour rise ,
Its substance gone , its strength decayed .
Of empire at one blow , pharsalia brought
God made the sexes to associate :
And wist not whither fear had led :
To win his honour and to make his name ,
They dancing went .
Below lay stretched the boundless universe !
He said , but soon corrected his mistake ,
Yet her firm breast some virgin tremors shook ;
Of the natures this i finde ,
Nor who so fortunate a course will run ,
The winds go howling through the night ,
Before a lonely cottage hung ,
And such the success the first colony met ,
But nature lost the date of this ,
And the rome they 'd fashioned would long endure .
But sticks and cudgels quickly stop the chace .
Knew that life passes and that virtue lasts ,
Now let the stars and stripes float high
All that expands the spirit , yet appals ,
When horror comes the way that beauty went .
Death alone can bring eternal rest ,
And learn what love and years advise .
Of laughter flickering back from shine to shade ,
The blue wave scarcely seems to touch the land .
Long as the ocean ’s flood shall stand
And calm the tempest which my sighs do raise !
But now his foes upon him pressed so fast ,
And shed a halo round two-score .
His countenance keeps least concealed from us ,
The heaven the creeds bestow .
As fits an universal woe ,
For peril can the bravest spirits move ,
Sorrow was there made fair ,
And sorrow 's faded form , and solitude behind .
Its woods , and that uncertain heaven , received
Save strength to help you face a pain foreseen ?
A cheque will cover sins like these --
Now their broad black beaks they lifted ,
And for the christian this accord shall enter
To sleep securely , when the candles wink ,
Were in some part neglected and made void . "
With the soul 's communion thrilled ,
The melting light that beamed above ,
Produce great persons , the rest follows .
" on the spirit 's pathway the light still lies
Them quick resentment stung , but him the most ,
Joy comes and goes , hope ebbs and flows
We needs must follow when fate puts from shore .
Sees death made drunk with war , sees time
So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom .
Fix in its place with thoughts that stand forever !
And winds which softly sing .
A ray of gold fell through the mist
Forthwith the vision fails and darkness comes ,
But always bearing in my breast a heart
Which makes thy children free ,
For some do hold our arthur can not die ,
The bird of the passion sang over his tears
The trojan thousands followed to the fray ,
Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led :
As doors and windows bared to some loud sea ,
And took his bidding like a flowery crown .
Bearing a lifelong hunger in his heart .
Foundations of a town to lay .
This done ; they muster in clean garments dressed ,
Of midas , which his greedy wish ensued ,
To bring that slaughter to an end ;
Wherewith the wild ways wound them : yet ,
And leaves the mind all dusk and dim
Forward as far as ever eye could stretch
When three nights had circled over ,
The tawny-hided desert crouches watching her .
And streaming banners , to that place had brought
As in the winters left behind ,
Made merriment within that pleasant bower .
Where the cliff hangs high and steep ,
From what once lovely lip it springs unseen !
To his ear there came a murmur
How to make glad one lowly human hearth ;
Not sunk in carnal pleasure , for which cause
All things to end are made ;
Where lay the king who breathed no more .
-- o fairness quick to fade ! ashes and rust
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish ,
And with thy riches make my soul so poor ?
Giving a sidelong leer at the rose ,
His little wealth had made him bold ,
As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves
And teach the fiery mischief where to fall .
Lit circled childhood round the virgin kneeling .
Yes , yes ! when age has made our eyes
Should stand unthrashed until her words were spent .
' which tells , as things approach a perfect state
All its sweetness gone to others ,
Till they had gained such foothold and such might
And that a peaceful sadness moved him now .
He wrought in poverty , the dull grey days ,
And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes ,
Give to the groom thy sweetness , softly sighing .
If the goblet made me suffer ,
He , who the hope within him entertained
No grief is grown so desperate , but the ill
It seemed that there her arms he met .
Before the gods had fled , would stand ,
Of beauty wherever the white bees cling .
When the fastest shearers are making play ,
Worse ills might follow than the ills we cure .
To gain it , men have shown
The love that mother gave us !
And the flowers that busk a bonnie brae ,
The hope of my spirit turns trembling to thee ,
Were poised and balanced , nor the war had given
Swayed by my voice , by mine example led ;
A woman 's voice came from the other side ,
Like a grey shadow lurking in the light ,
And livid lamps where vypers spoon ,
And mark yon rocky walls that stand
That sin-stained heart to bear ,
They who made our garret gay .
Chewing with teeth that grind and crush , each part
Of life is gone -- mimosa shrinks ,
The several paths that lead them to their farms ,
That makes plish exceeding glum .
The fool took notice and slowly arose ,
Of every blossom that the meadow brings ,
And from the laws whose orbits cross and run
The bounds the brave of heart have set
Where a mighty fight is raging ,
Which makes the hearts of gods rejoice ;
Then snatch the moment fate allows ,
And , ever while the spiritual mill goes round ,
His conscience felt an hell :
With speed what force is left , and all employ
And all its beauty can but make me cry .
_ wherein all nature 's treasure is contained . _
Here equal laws have sway ;
Then to her breast that youth she drew ,
And helping mortals , found my own despair .
Her very breathing , and she raised
Of sweet came sour , of day came night ,
So fit a church to praise god in !
The blows were mortal which he gave or lent ,
Of glory reached them , dropt away .
What forth it draws must the one way wander .
And freely now express their joy ;
Like this sorrow ' twill come ,
Forced to gaze on ghastly faces ,
May thy billows roll ashore
Their hearts are blown away on the hot breeze .
And only got a discreet coward 's name ,
Tyr thought hard till he hammered out a plan ,
" it will not go for nought . "
Restore , restore eurydice to life :
That led to peace in love 's sweet atmosphere :
I made a wish that i might feel his kiss
Let us form a sacred compact :
How it gushes and struggles out
The dwarf in anguish aims the vengeful wound ;
Exclaiming , drew me towards him from the place ,
Waste marshes shine and glister to the moon
And the bitter war goes on .
And the pillar fell asunder ,
Follow your saint , follow with accents sweet !
Behind the mist my virgin ramparts lie ,
And i felt that this love was immortal ,
They reached the leafy wilderness ,
She looked on , and her looks went everywhere .
How passed the night through thy long waking ? "
Make payment for his pleasure ,
And lead to war the armies of the skies .
Then falls upon the rapture of her soul ,
Against his sovereign raised the brand ,
And now he takes the open air ,
Sorrowing , still , though life be set ,
Obey this one request i make ,
A giant 's club withheld the blow ;
Gives power and purity where'er he flows ,
To make the fragrance of the summer full ,
Time calls you now ; the precious hour employ :
They rush into the strife !
And hostile nations make a common flood .
The massy structure stood ; but when the best
Oppressed , ill-used , she faded young ,
Here stands the house as i remember it .
Daylight fades and night must follow ,
Thy kindred ambush lies before ,
And as he fell the vital spirit fled .
Each heart recalled a different name ,
To make more dark the desolate expanse .
He turned his look to the mysterious man ,
To leave the beaten ways of art ,
Arrows are piercing through my heart , --
To him whom fate impelled to die :
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
I need not be missed if another succeed me ,
That prickles buys puts prickles out of frame ;
As ever on lover 's breast found place ;
I heard old ocean raise her voice and cry ,
And the ebbing tide goes sobbing out , murmuring wistfully
' when death and old despair inhabit here ? '
In the faith that looks through death ,
Will rivers of feeling come once more stealing
Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons
Her mad relations came pouring in .
That rapturous wonder grasping after grief --
For her the seas their pearls reveal ;
Let cowards beat the breast and wail ,
No freeman 's hand their darken 'd chambers made --
Of conflict , and he calmed those deadly winds .
Lay , lapped in dreamless slumber ,
About her unresolving husband threw .
Content to go on dreaming ,
The fountain of perpetual peace flows there --
He made a road of my broken works
Into pieces three it broke .
Of meditation scarcely seen thy waves ,
And prayers all rose-clouds hovering high ?
If again he returns to his practice of lies ,
When sins must be confessed and washed away !
And black , black fell the night .
Who love a swinging breeze ;
And cowering foes shall shrink beneath
Flames shall rise to gladden and appease her ,
Like the tenth wave , that offers to the shore
Ere yet her pale lips could the story impart ,
And the letter read as follows :
The harder fight is gained by thee .
A single impulse whence a wish could grow .
The dying savage feels the weapon drove .
Never do thou make the answer ,
Thine hour hath come ! eternity
Some buoyed with pitchers crossed the tide ,
Art not led to swamps and lowlands ,
That shines in human eyes ?
Love , who swayest this mortal breath ,
Thy providence turns all to good .
And still with words of love her bounty took .
That life was almost quivering on my lips ,
" for his songs i caught the adder ,
And of my heart 's deep silence made
His solitary refuge took .
Passing that way his benediction give .
With the deluge of summer it receives ;
Let all the flowers wake to life ;
Along the army 's front its banners shake ;
To tell his worth , the marble of this tomb
And faces , held as steadfast as their swords ,
Till old experience do attain
The husband 's anger rose ! -- and red
Of mother earth , which there arose
And to disordered rage let loose the reins
He covered up with what came afterward ,
My song might shadow forth that saintly smile ,
And honour , as long as waves shall break ,
But he round whom their quarrels keep ,
His pale lips quiver , and his wandering eyes
Which scorpion-like was armed with a sting .
The sweat ran down my brow ,
And he 's warbling a sweet little song ,
Love , that endures for a breath ;
His eyes were failing and almost blind .
His tangled prey , or guided what he spun .
Unless politeness were added thereto ?
For him who came with love and life ,
In turn it hits and drives the body too .
To catch a comfortable ray from thee .
And it seem 'd mixed with blood of bears ,
Till his race has run ,
Sick heart , weary limbs caressing .
The lamb once slain its perfect light ,
Through all his veins came flooding in
Lest neptune , breaking through the solid earth ,
To eyes divine where the white lights shine
Win my heart and then deceive me ?
To strengthen and support his reign .
Then turned on the maiden a rapturous grin ,
But rather to take truce !
Until the year is spent ;
Yet they took counsel to restrain
The call went forth the goblets all to fill ,
Promotion has been cursed slow ,
The atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew ;
The tree where buddha 's vision fell
The law that bound our planets binding still
And sullen turn 'd to quench his thirst again ,
I know a valley opening to the east .
They form one social shade as if convened
Where the smoke of the cooking hung grey :
Each lordly helm is tossed in trust
They long to lead to battles bolder .
The spirit paused in silent thought
But with its sound it shook the sails ,
The fog and smoke must cover it from pity ,
To his rescue either would have made repair ,
True as rivers downward run ,
To give repentance to her lover ,
With mutual grace to form the man divine .
And ghastly famine made to serve his ends ?
It whirled away . cold silence fell .
But now hath god laid on me cureless pain
And calm the raging tempest of thy soul . '
She now perceived it were great oversight ,
And plunder 'd countries , to make commerce free .
Slowly the watches of the night are gone ,
Professional license , if carried too far ,
The fruit of death or life to bear ,
To gain such objects as their pride may sate .
In a field where the dew lay cold and deep
To take earth 's wonder with surprise ?
Had filled his soul with song divine ;
There the green myrtle finds a place ,
Of baptism blends them all into a blood .
Nor yet on that which breaks to flame
The mist blew from the sea ,
Now , when i make my prayer
Until together had they pledged their faith
And public trial of their prowess make ;
Which out of both lost countenances grew .
Opening fell symphony of ghastly sound ,
Down in the race the toppling waters shout ,
And the winds whose wings rain balm
Tidings send to hiawatha ! "
Though vain the muse , and every melting lay ,
Derived from that fair spirit from whom all true
Merrily , merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances
Poor thing ! i grieved to see it swell .
So in the mind of nature now awakes
To show us how love 's quickening flame
Of music that is born of human breath
The sad disheartened life that mesmer led .
I wear the hideous shape you see .
He rose for their good ,
Solicit arms unknown , and tempt the sword ,
To sting to tears his old eyes heavy -- two
Whose deeds the sporting prints declare :
Which came in the beginning , was not changed ;
For the pathway leads to nowhere ,
Let us make friends with the stars ;
Tell him the truth , and sees that it accords
Which gives free entrance to the pure in heart ,
I took the metro at saint lazare ;
Winds are whispering , " violets ! "
The worst society thou find ' st will show thee
His heart swelled with pleasure , affection and pride .
But when the fury took her stand on high ,
To noble harmony , be seen , be known .
But the full moonlight fell on her --
To ages following ,
And the peace of a harmless folk was shattered ;
His life still kept alive in thee .
For all who sprang to answer the great call ;
One day he took a kind of notion
Repairs the wrongs that quito 's sons sustained ,
Decay that comes to slay in open love ,
Here the parisians make no further head ,
To welcome his abrupt advances ;
And it comes to me , can it really be
Like a ghost , that goes at sunrise ,
France too returns , but keeps a tighter rein ,
Mine be the nymph , whose form reposes
Backward on life that rises , where he rose
One side holds a losing case .
Yet fate the animal does still pursue ;
If vice and virtue want , compassion first .
As the angels ' hymns resound .
And i went and followed those seedy ones ,
The power given by our loving father
Our way lies where god knows
That saves him from wreck .
At that word his wrath boiled o’er ;
The sacred fane of childhood , when first reared ,
His beads of beauty over , seeking there
He said , because he got his wealth thereby .
Not bad ! but before i book the bet
That angela gives promise she will do
The feeble life spark , and his finger tips
But the smile of the victor will take it ;
Give thy house a thorough cleansing ,
My lingering feet will leave their print no more ;
There comes the sound as of abundant rain .
Immortal is held out to holy hope ,
And he will give thee rest :
Shall gain the hissing hate of fools ,
Which puts all ireland in a passion ;
There hung a darkness , call it solitude
And kept the country-side in fear ) ,
The spider night now spins his monstrous web ,
Wider than church extends the kingdom 's bound :
And through much caution sees 'em rise too high ;
That i more bitterness in death may taste .
Laughing water draws around it ,
Love is passing ! love is passing !
Stranger , in pity lend one pensive sigh ,
For our hearts shall not give way .
In his place in heaven the sun stood still .
Such fever burns him , of his sorrow bred ,
He cast a spell on my mate ,
The man replied ; it figures jesus christ .
With my consent , nor stand exposed to pride
" like a dull lake the heart must lie ;
For spring at last has come ,
The fabric of virtue and freedom to build .
Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth !
We are not left forlorn ,
A sad existence each shall lead .
To mark a friend 's remains these stones arise --
- when i had left , and the swinging trees
My first may garland lies ;
His fame puts forth fresh blossoms hour by hour ;
Will ever shine thy natal day !
But beat her with her wreath in playful glee .
To try your fortune , bound or free ,
Happiness in his power left free to will ,
Where silence never tames the mountain-roar ,
As lowly spices gone to sleep ,
His holy meditations thus pursued : --
“ o raven , raven , stay thy wing ,
Her trade supported , and supplied her laws ;
That through the dank and clammy darkness sent
Now rosy may comes in wi ' flowers .
Is battle nature 's mandate , here it reigned ,
Whither the phantom first had led the soul .
To fill all hearts with deeper glee , --
The world my cures doth see ,
For love that stirred it in their breast
Sighing through all her works gave signs of woe ,
Appeared to give the sky another sun .
My growing fortune soon should flow ,
Would not reproach me with the loss i felt .
And now the fluting led that gathered tide
Give potentates the lie .
As thy pure spirit strove to gain her rest .
Lets fall the pastoral crook .
Of jesus ' love was early felt ;
Beneath which , figures and more matters lay ,
To wade through death to meet with it ;
Or is thy luster drawn from heavenly hues , --
The swift wind caught the flowery rain
Whisper : " remembrance holds no tears ! "
A fitter preparation might be made
A rib he took from adam 's side ,
Seemed withering , and for the moment lost .
They borrow thunder from the vulcan forge ,
May take him for his daily bread .
The venom thou hast poured on me
Nice to hear the silence buzzing --
Deep the grief that settled o'er him ,
The female gave a plaintive wail
Behold the fortunes that are made ,
And purple cloak exulting with brocade ,
Will shrink from it shudderingly ,
Where sorrow sits with lonely eyes ,
That only serves to make us grieve
To breathe thee over lonely seas .
She leaves her soldier -- famine and a name !
And the faithless gods go ;
He earns how stocks will fall or rise ;
He made but little clerking in the store ,
Away , too , all his dreams had rolled ;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
Lead where thy sons shall follow , mother land :
To whet their courage and their rage provoke .
It tells me every cloud is past
With lullaby now take thine ease ,
" with fair music comes ye morn ,
't is not enough no harshness gives offense ,
At least to one vague terror , gave relief :
Shall see her realm of reason swept away ,
But narad muni took the word .
And shudder of water that makes felt on land
Should e'er hae joined the templar crew !
Rolls up , ascending from the infernal fires .
That in proud dulness joins with quality ,
To feel how the winds came on .
" and ye that fell upon sleep ,
To do the deed so blithely hailed ;
Which moves the less , for gifts divine
The leaf lay in it ,
That won my heart in my greener years . "
The cry from balen ’s lips that sprang
Whoever flees , and unto him that shows
But like an arrow to the river takes .
Rose in his hands and stole into his art .
The dull flames at his feet leap fitfully ,
The famous dangers that attend thy will .
Half the light that gilds to-day ;
Come up , express themselves and pass away ;
In words no dictionary can explain .
When first my voice it knew ;
Striving for something that it can not reach ,
And hallowed springs , will court the cooling shade !
The greatest favour i can ask ,
Glory that shall heavenward move .
Great fame remained ; and ere it die away
Set beside the awful terrors
Enraptured ; low she laughs , his woes disperse ;
He seems to struggle from the grasp of death .
Than woods or waters , leans the languid sky
A love that spreads from zone to zone :
Stealing and hiding the theft by a lie
O weary hour ! o aching days that passed
The deep black forests have covered them .
And dewy faces where the sunshine lies .
From which emerge ( the form itself unseen )
Filled fu ' wi ' clavers about sin
I know the wood which hides the daffodil ,
To stars that brushed them with their silver wings .
Delightful it is when the fair season comes ,
Where the miracle lies anchored . "
A vine crept up , and with long fingers made
The source of power on earth derived to kings !
The deed to which the sailor gave his word .
Sheep come softly through mist as shadows ,
As plates of silver met his view ;
Though fools may think his race is run ,
The british king before me seems to stand .
Till science to knowing the highest shall lovingly turn ,
Take courage ; trouble not thy mind with thoughts
But , sitting by the tumbling blue of waves ,
Through deeper shades can reach the broken heart ,
To seek for a king was their intent ,
They wake before the day to range the wood ,
Serene and manly , hardened to sustain
Had darkness fallen -- unthreatened , unproclaimed --
Who puts a period to domestic strife .
A friendship all his kingdoms could not buy .
Still run on poets in a raging vein ,
Of roaring battle , and meantime i see
His mercy fills the khyber hills --
To which the fairies whirl and shine
Their length extended , three on either side :
Certes fit teacher to command , because
The cowardice of my judgment sees , aghast ,
Each finds the old , lost paradise again ,
Then of a sudden the mountains swam ,
Of india 's sons , encircling , pour along .
Your shadow ever goes before
The pure flame the smoky hearth it burned on ,
Shafts bright with gold to tear and rend ,
Now sliding streams the thirsty plants renew ,
My juliet , shining through this clan .
Fate whirls our plans , our all away ;
And cast the dark foundations deep ,
But sorrows else have shadowed all things there ;
The sun had passed his noon and westward sloped ;
The mutual friendship is as fixed
And make his face to shine upon you , and
She caught her language from thy voice ;
They forging sat calamity to troy .
For lips that meet in kisses . --
Which brought us hither ,
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds ;
So through the anaesthetic shows my life ;
Fair strings of pearl their radiant fingers hold ,
And thy young blush the tender answer tells ;
The party breaking up and
Purple music flows ! "
The moors and woods that shone and sang ,
How jubilant it was to give me pleasure .
Ailes , whose broad curves gigantic ribs sustain ,
But the belle she would n't be passed ;
It swells the echoes of the grove ,
To the halls where my love lay dying ! "
To keener joy or suffering they are stirred .
And from that sad moment took
Let the old life be covered by the new :
Gains a good name gains something for himself ,
Thence through his breast its bloody passage tore ;
Where dim delights are brightened into bliss ,
And feel the foretaste of eternity ,
Just as they gathered stomach for the leap ,
As equal comes to equal , throne to throne .
The same shall you finde by me . ’
Lo yonder comes proud king henry .
Who hold olympus , witness to us both !
Round about him spun the landscape ,
It hangs within his memory as fresh
Thine shall be all thy heart can seek . ”
Within him had lit up and nursed
Of all hearts in grief that come
Soul pursues an orbit here
My grannie spent a merry youth ,
A new moon shines , there come times
And the faded hue it wears .
The final stroke is come ,
To match the princely chase , afford ? "
Which once in clusters white its berries bore ,
An english blackbird straight began a song
A light that shifts , a glare that drifts ,
But when the melancholy fit shall fall
I beach the bow where sands in shadows lie ;
As surely as the month comes round ;
How then support thy fate ,
Till , spent , she sought her silent room ,
That lies like a garment floating fair
And tried and manly hearts surround them .
Laid up provision for his heir ,
Through the sweet voices broke ;
Till the sun ’s kiss shall bid them wake .
Then king henry shifted his room .
Filled with rage , began his singing ;
They looked to give her shelter in her need ,
Continent that at present enjoy considerable reputations .
How strength may serve for purity is shown
Or her fever would crawl to each digit .
Upon religion 's shrine , there vibrating
For all the future held so rich and rare ;
That lifted each a trembling flame to make
That bind and hold my heart ;
Abode his destined hour , and went his way .
Autumn brings a mist and rain
The winds are wont to blow !
And of his purpose came alike in aid
The tiny thing still struggled for its life ,
To draw the gravy off , were best ,
Beating down the gates of battle ,
As runs the water from a pair
The cold fear that follows and finds you ,
The earth wind , rushing in your ears ,
Pillowy air he treads a time and hangs
The stars fade out where the moon comes ,
Those glaring colours laid
And with holes all round to send the light
The moorish strength lay prostrate on the ground .
And hair that trailed in beauty round his neck ;
And made a swift sign to his father ;
Each noon sits veiled in mysteries of mist ;
Starved my soul and gone to business every day .
My true-love sighed for sorrow ,
The fountains whence they rose ,
Summer not a song would borrow ! --
The moonlight fell , glossing the sable tide
With his poor servant , brought to saddest plight
In battle ’s front lay drenched in gore .
High ground , as virgin cynthia sways the tides :
While white fear leapt from lip to lip :
The same conditions which himself did make .
The blazing hall of grandeur , and the throng
And torrid happiness that cleaved the same ;
Where winds may howl , but dare not pierce ;
To which it gave us right of birth ,
A silvery ring , circling her nearer realm
To minos down he bore me , and the judge
Of knowledge , out of which he fell .
That , for the virtuous , life prepares ;
The woodland trees that stand together ,
Blue flames that hovered o'er the springs
And courage to sustain it ; mary marsh
Our summer hearts make summer 's fulness , where
With heat and light revives the golden day ,
Hostile lines to charge with fury ,
Yet the one strip of faded brightness shown
That each should go directly to his heart .
She 's lost its fellow , so golden yellow ,
Lonely and bored . he stirred my love besides ;
And opens more the character of death ;
And felt how awful goodness is , and saw
If yet i share the old man 's memory :
Asleep will lay thee , till thine eye
Answered in the words which follow :
Men should stand marked with far more wickedness
And all the bitterness of death is darkening
Of justice doth run counter to the edge .
So come when the valleys are sheening ,
Affection bends the judgment to her ply .
Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground ;
“ their forms in shapes lascivious ; spouting high ,
Old prisoner , dropped thy blood as rain
On ashes left by attila , had spent
The seasons rolled like troops of billows blown
Truly my speech with my thought keeps no pace .
And found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted ,
The fountain of perpetual peace flows there --
No breeze of battle ever fanned
Joys that once escape us fly for evermore .
Of age shall rack our bones , or quake
And in the song it mingled . and the dame
And his humble petition puts up day by day ,
These courtiers keep the secret of their king ;
Prone to the dust oppression shall be hurled ,
Took him to rest .
A grave distinction they have come to wear , --
Tears , which though vainly now they roll ,
While from their lips burst curses of despair ;
But our flag flies its way
In a minute can lovers exchange a word ?
Who stole sleep from baby 's eyes
Shriek rose on shriek , -- the sabbath air
Strike -- and secure a triumph or a tomb !
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire :
Honest they are , and patient they have kept ;
But thy quick temper always served thee ill . '
Anna pretended that she felt a fright
His weapon drove ; the brazen mail it broke ,
Trembling the spectres glide , and plaintive vent
Possess those joys denied by day . "
Beyond compare the son of god was seen
But god , who oft descends to visit men
Leading the dance of light waves chanting low --
In the east , the clouds are gathering ,
While duty is a path which all may tread .
And follow ye to your home . ”
And take hire in min arm alofte
Makes old kind blessings into curses pass :
Which in this world the litanies assume .
But when i see them take a flight ,
Thy winter past , and come the days of gold
Yet since their eyes make heart so sore ,
And not one thought to contradict it came .
Answered in the words which follow :
When the first great test of our friendship came --
Though years have clipped the eagle 's plume
And yet he warbles songs of war ;
But when away his regiment ran ,
My age hath got experience in each thing .
I turn a parting look , and lift to heaven
So the sweet maiden filled his heart ,
Of truth and freedom mid these temples breathed ,
A king might wish to hold in fee .
A miser whose rich hives squeeze oozing combs .
With fears distracted , with no fix ’d design ;
Brings to good issue every honest prayer .
Indignant , furious , at the words that fell
The wind began full loud to blaw ;
With snowy sails to the free winds tossed ?
To gossip never do their tongues feel tired .
As if they set all human skill at naught !
The moon still continues her clear light to shed
The shadow of a presence which had passed .
Shrieking to the sky , sought a thousand miracles .
Which whirling ran around so rapidly ,
And when the shadows of twilight came ,
You smile , which means you sun yourself within
An hundred years should go to praise
Since pulpits fail , and sounding-boards reflect
Amort o'er the sea came speeding
In cloistered aisles they keep to-day
And called for a lover , a lover !
No more shall nations bow before thy throne .
Slowly a tear stole down his cheek ,
To find the precious morning hours were lost .
And grief with raven note usurp the night .
- rather a world of pressing men in arms ,
While pun and prank we gaily gave and took ,
While from the yellow stars that splashed the skies
And , chased by rippling wakes of foam ,
Of that faint fragrance blown from her soft hair .
Throughout , though plain experience hath it never shown .
It gives a lovely light !
Making a summons to death a deliverance .
And watch dawn bring the day , " --
But left the assembly incomplete ;
That could in pleasantness compare with these .
The stars can not send forth their light .
Meeting : the brass flashed out like leaping flames .
Then ceased ; the filial virtue made reply ;
The time draws near the birth of christ
Of course the change must be conceived as speedy ;
From the impious worship that seduced the world .
Are bathed in a blush of rose ;
Whom fate has loaded with a weight of woes ;
Slowly his sense and strength regained ,
Which none but secret sisterhood may see ,
And the stumble of frenzied feet going by
So greece , that late in conquering troops pursued ,
And in her life mine only fear lies dead ,
The gifts that time should rise and bring
Soon churned the tempest , till the air
Spirits are we , but 't is found
Not even in forts he rests secure : --
The moving whisper of huge trees that branch 'd
Or the steep walls obstructed , round them cast
Thrilled by the songs his bow had bound .
And the year of zion 's redemption comes .
They strike a shudder through my being still
Hot iron songs to save the rest of me ;
And drew his giant brother near .
Peace and plenty bring the strangers . "
As time went on , there came queer glances
Whose sweet words take the hearts of all ,
Be lapped in glory , seeing strength arise
See now to what this obstinacy comes :
Flowers the rain has left to play .
O impious act , including all foul harms !
Thickens the air with strange delight , and lays
As the swift seasons roll !
Its current thence to serve the city brings ;
Knows that we have slipped old time ,
The dame made a curtsey ,
The light from his shop spread afar and made brighter
Black desert gripped in iron silences ,
And never wounded , but death followed it ;
Could find the time for so much schooling ?
Bubbling runnels join 'd the sound ;
Olympian jove himself his rage inspire .
When the time for parting comes , and the
Sounds , and goes sounding through the woods profound .
His mourning notes are borne away
And for his glory all things made , all things
The rosy and elastic dawn , the flashing sun ,
The blossom of a trust appears
As the clouds are swept from heaven ,
And all that went down doing their duty ,
And rising high their flight to heaven they took :
Which holds the warring worlds in one .
But to you , as time takes him ,
There lay three shepherds tending their sheep .
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
The subtle soul sits everywhere , unstained :
Across the centuries there comes no sound
Our happier bard takes the season that suits ,
The night bird warbles his madrigal ,
When love and joy kept holiday ?
How comes it that he wrote a book
Nor from the place depart , while life remained ,
Of saul , and set the universal voice
Would she could make of me a saint ,
What kindles his poetic fire ?
Christmas songs at times have tried .
The sway of man 's perfidious foe :
Gaze on , and fall directly forth on life .
Like that imagination throws ; --
Then went on with a pleasant smile ,
The squadrons spread their sable wings behind .
In kindly keeping with the good of all ,
A shadow came , and deepened in her eyes .
At his command they there did stand
The sunlight found the golden bands
My heart would give her of love 's due ;
Was all the trouble euclid took
And through these things my pencil pushes softly
Of peace not bought with victory .
That gods are come , immortal , great ,
And all things flourish where you turn your eyes .
What bitterness he in his gesture put ,
Be passed on the proud heights of sway ,
Where the race of men go by --
From every pang is given to the dead , --
Never a weakness that he doth not feel ;
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee ,
Directs the prow to some more christian clime .
This sun shall see our tyrant yield ,
The pain to be deprived or to forget .
An ' bore fraternal greetin 's
That shines a greeting from afar ;
Song , " follow a shadow , it
Or is it by the jealous powers concealed ,
The hand that held the steel :
To know you as you were has ranged .
To wend their way the warrior gave command .
And straight to palaces and temples spread .
Who took it patiently , and wiped his head ;
And the christmas eve has come ,
And guide us to the strand .
Another couplet followed in the manuscript :
From the fields came corn in plenty ,
Was to confer on me immortal life ,
Which had conveyed the king of sericane
He felt sound logic proved he should be roasted .
Again the fragrance came ; a woman spoke ;
And , bending , whispered low of love
That sinner ’s head will split in seven .
I passed some truly april days .
Words came at last ,
His glory fills the land -- the plain ,
The jealous moonlight drifted
And him i saw bow down , because of death
And of created purpose reach the ends .
Nay , every penny i could raise .
For sorrow , but the darkness covers all --
The light of truth reflected , and the smile
With secret transports to the stars addressed ,
Broke the trembling green of mirrored trees .
His fiery eyes that turns and rolls about ;
To him the seed of their dissensions show ,
Now look , here is a letter in this pamphlet
And in thy harbour give us rest .
A holiday , that shows your pity ,
We felt the minutes crawl :
And carols float along the happy air ,
Of joy , till , spreading uncontain 'd ,
Till all the fertile earth lies cover 'd deep .
In that still trance did sweet thoughts come
Some girls as if by love possessed ,
Has passed ; while mars in lightning 's fitful flames
It made anacreon 's song divine :
The waves that faintly fall and slowly run ,
And send us out to meet our certain fate ?
" canst thou give me now some wisdom ,
For the dead pine 's roots to hold ?
Around him rose the bare , discolored walls ,
Of the havoc they have wrought ;
And the grief no other eyes had seen
" there has gone your son unhappy ,
That makes you dreadful in retreat .
But the faint blush that tinged her cheek betrayed
And his stare fixed upon the fire :
We swallowed the lies he was ordered to tell --
And the steed sprang lightly forward .
Take care , in your desire to please ,
That forced my heart to die ,
Sometimes the guilty are set free ,
They bring to cheer the way . "
To hell then follows the musician !
Of a gerfalcon , soaring into sight ,
Who made those structures rebels to my power --
Should make all nature lovelier , and itself
So down his face its broken halves descend ;
Shall each to each , with lifted looks serene ,
When the winter of life is come ,
What troop is this that follows ,
All the beauty of paradise which eve lost .
In the cradle made for rocking ,
Nine months successive now had rolled round ,
But england 's lion leaping from its lair
Far off the village clock struck one .
So , giving me its benediction , singing ,
And the years rolled swiftly onward ;
Fair science frowned not on his humble birth ,
From blest arabia 's groves to india came ;
Quiet lay the sturgeon , nahma ,
Saw many a blissful season glide ,
He who can come beneath that awful cope ,
Come ! who 'll venture its rebuff ?
They sought the shaded waters ' freshening boon ,
The glorious fortune , which for you has stayed ,
To the halls where my love lay dying . "
And every time that love has made me weep ,
At age mature arrived , thou , graceful vine !
Behold now the fall of ideas i have reached ,
Where groves of trees and thickets gave approach
We leave the senses who interpret her ;
All things investing with hues of life :
By candles casting shadows weird and grim ,
Have reached unbudding boughs to the dim day
In front the sun climbs slow , how slowly !
" they can not change the frost 's decree ,
As one would pass from gentle friend to friend .
The music stopped and i stood still ,
Sharing the bitterness of all things made .
Driven along in sun and moonlight ,
Hast thou a star to guide thy path ,
Life sprung to loving nature for defence ;
Are mad with spite and hatred ; jars arise ,
She made a conquest by her tears !
Sweet clay to lie under the pitiful sod :
Sweet hallelujahs there resound
Old cotta shamed his fortune and his birth ,
And cut the branch ; to save the shock
For his soul kept up too much light
My languid numbers have forgot to flow ,
Exclaiming , drew me towards him from the place ,
And cast the kingdoms old
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell .
And to take shapes of plants and creatures deigns
Fearlessly thither pricked the warriors , who
The alarum of drums swept past ,
On its border shone the moonlight ,
Half sob , half laughter , music swept along ;
And to their new-made sovereign cleave .
" joyful life the seal is leading ,
Remembrance only wakes them to forgive ;
All his sinews were strained until they snapped ,
Then fall unto your cheer ,
The daylight is dying , the night drawing near ,
The house of job is making now on thee
Thou would ' st find peace and rest :
Of fire the smoke climbed to the upper air ;
For the nature most undone ,
To dazzle merely , or to wound us ?
And filling their infants with terror ,
A satchel passed from hand to hand .
Whose spirit breathed high heaven , and drew thence
Five pennies lay her hand within , --
Would wear forevermore the curse of cain !
Each held fast the same weird power ,
Most holy , if by chance led here ,
And the stars swung low their silver lamps
And fast the flames rolled on .
Through what strange ways my pathway now may lead ;
My life is gone , why speak of joy ?
And on raptures follow calms ;
Forth to the haunts , by cooling winds made cheery
Down they laid their lives for us ,
To which our hearts are clinging .
But kept my eyes upon my plate
And vanity stand shrined and deified ,
To a finite grave . they will rise in faith
But tasks in hours of insight willed
Drew nearer , how our downward course we wound .
Retreat , they follow you !
Songs to see , past pitch of sweet .
Did meseem these shapes that ministered ,
No use ; all the money was gone .
A thing that creeps , it can not go ,
He clasped in this revived , uprisen france ,
The soul that sensed all flowerful loveliness ,
And how i cook it you shall see .
But you are nothing ! your pages turn to water
Time , ever bearing on with steady pace ,
The grief that clouds thy lovely brow ;
How her wife-loyal heart had borne
For thou art nearer to him , and take heed
Peace comes to the battered
To take a judgment broad and wide ;
Yet they asked for a star ,
They , ardent , kindling spirits pour ;
When my sails are filled with south-winds ,
And languid forms rise up , and pulses bound
To turn simplicity to beauty 's zone ?
Ah , ah ! the twilight bristles wild with shapes
This is the task that fits heroic hands ;
That to their weary hearts must needs arise .
A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed
Left murmuring , what deepest thought can tell ?
The steward brings the deeds which must convey
Where portals swing forever in
That i kept my vow . "
Truth never fails , nor beauty waxes old ;
Under cliffs that tear the blue ,
But hate and fury ill supplied
So that its own appearance it maintains ,
When i my rightful portion sought ,
I felt convinced that men preferred
But too much love , lay dead and still --
Processions form 'd for piety and love ,
Supported , the assembly thus address 'd .
My ! if the wine should yet be flowing .
Shall feel the shower of mercy fall ,
And a thousand words discover ,
Hath silence given a thousand times reproof .
And that is the way that some loves go .
That no proud mortal touch has ever stirred .
Spirits dried up and closely furl 'd ,
In heaps , and fuel for the flames prepare .
The dreadful joy thy son has sent
It was not thus our copious language grew :
As holy writ gives to affected minds .
They had decreed his living flesh should bear :
She filled . not hours , not minutes left ;
His heart was hardened with his too much care ,
Little white lily sunshine has fed ;
Gentle rest hath softly bound thee ,
The grisly wound dismiss ’d his soul to hell ,
It winna break .
The phantoms of a battle came to dwell
And lit my pinnacled desire .
To dim the sunshine of my faith
To carry false intelligence ,
My heart still hovers o'er ye , o !
Dawn comes creeping , the weary nighttime slips
And many a long deep sigh he drew ,
Full canvas , head to wind !
I took her for some scottish muse ,
Now golden fruits on loaded branches shine ,
A rhythmic murmur fills the quietude ;
Unborn that read these words and saw her not .
Flying the fury of the franks are seen ;
With fear unspeakable ye shun the fight ? "
Thou hast brought us the signs of spring ,
Saw the lifeless form extended ,
But , as my waving sword the blood surrounds ,
Hacks us thus cruelly , slivering again
A wretch the most complete that breathes the air !
In rapture lost be lapped within the all .
Yet craving higher honor , went alone ,
And birks extend their fragrant arms
Unarmed he went midst martial mails ,
And there lie cold , to death resigned ,
A taste seen in the choice of his abode ,
And give repentance but an hour 's delay .
For counsel , he 'll turn to .
A foolish strife ; they see
That thus from vices driven ,
Tho ' reason on the darkest reckons ;
And there lies gude sir patrick spens ,
At the army of rats that was drawing near .
Back the sun will come in gold !
On their tracks his eyes were fastened ,
Upon their people ran the knights he brings ,
But a little time passed over ,
And in this darkness dies the heavenly fire .
The play is done ; the curtain drops ,
Perchance might save some soul from hell ;
Winter 's fine pleasures pass 'd away
The barrister is bound to plead
Then , goddess , let thy cruel shears descend !
Or off the knees of murder reaching it .
Where no life came except defeated life .
Thy breath comes to me whispering an impossible hope .
Which having passed and yielded him small treasure ,
All heaven drew nigh to hear her sing ,
I 'll meet the raging of the skies ,
This love which had made me so weak .
And i with the ox will the journey make .
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice ,
Juan was drawn thus into some attentions ,
Which swayed the axes trembled , and the men ,
Should pass , like bitter grief with time .
His providence extending everywhere ,
Nor join ’d swift horses to the rapid car .
In monstrous fusion of sound ever smiting on sound
But sure the piece you yet may mend :
Holding her faith pure to the very letter :
That shout , which shook the land with fear ,
King solomon drew merchantmen ,
Few are made , but numbers lost .
That book will pass from hand to hand ,
And so all night marched the nation 's dead ,
Unjust decree ! while this enjoys the state ,
Did ever god such privilege attain ?
Grew long , and evenings goldened ;
It came at once to do me good ;
Wan-sallow as the plant that feels itself
And every one his valiant prowess showed ,
And then it brought riches beside ;
And what is left to hope , my dear ,
And swelling in mist it mounts a mighty cloud .
Of snowdrops trembling to the chilly gale ,
So fierce achilles raged , on ev'ry side
And vengeance in each bosom stirred :
All duties have embraced in being free .
He turn 'd to joy and merriment ,
From the land of the spirits pale as dew
And the waves gently kissed the classic shore
The roofs and porches flamed with constant fire .
I love that beauty should go beautifully :
From farthest desert touched the town ,
Ye talk of days and men now nothing made ,
A wretched headache kept me home . "
Her finger , annie fought against his will :
And from rebellion shall derive his name ,
A sudden tremor through his limbs ran fast ,
The wind came briskly up this way ,
And after autumn past -- if left to pass
And instant gave reply . “ the temple leave ,
Sudden a touch upon my shoulder came ,
The mountain mist took form and limb ,
Which used to roll in wealth so pleasantly ;
And thereby made me pity him the more . "
And he spoke the words which follow :
To hide the fraud . at interview both stood
No care had touched his cheek with mortal doom ,
Virtue she finds too painful an endeavour ,
Hurling himself against them , had he snapped ,
Must all her arrows hit that part ?
Of whom still sorrowing milan holds discourse ;
They melt , they vanish from my eyes .
That choir of youthful voices wreathed
That one would weene that one sole cities strength
At what that dying eve had brought to pass ,
And leaning grandly to the gale ,
Shall see our dual soul from death released
When sweet expanding love its object sought ?
Love entered in my heart one day ,
Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe ,
When through her heart the gospel current streamed ,
That moment felt his soul entranced .
Every star has gone away .
Where peace her jealous home had built ;
And cast him into hell , to roast !
It seems ( while the besotted rabble bends )
And he spake the words which follow :
Their constant ward and watching kept .
In anguish there thy frighted eyes shall roll ,
And found no solace , no relief
So norsemen 's sails run out and try
A wight that will weather damnation ,
Each shouldering for her smile . "
It gives the beaten courage ; to the lost
Therefore with reverence take this day her visible token .
Steering at random , just as chance directs --
' twill serve to render plain to him and prove
And sad indeed when youth is left alone
Polluted lay , and dreadful rang his arms .
Love looked back as he took his flight ,
His heavy grief no bosom shared ,
Her kindly solace brought his soul relief .
Whose conscience takes the fee , consider this --
By night reversed the labours of the day .
A thousand dreams your voice recalls and brings ;
Not a sorrow came from its hiding place
Drive away the clouds which over their happiness hover !
Its very shape , its own direction fixed .
It draws us to thy side in prayer ,
It guided home the plunging boats
Douglas a parting blessing gave ,
Excepting there where joy is made eternal .
And good king arthur held knightly sway !
As spun foam lifted and borne on
Dread king awake , of pleasures take thy fill ,
I want employment that will give
Dreams often more than waking passions move .
So i went on softly from the glade ,
That every hyacinth the garden wears
Hath found new channels full and meet --
Sorrow which i bear , but can not utter !
Whose sovereignty a thousand trumpets brayed ,
Filling night so gently , that it dreams
Smiles form the channel of a future tear ,
An earthly lover lurking at her heart .
That would make your blood run cold ;
A deep felt horror thrills through all my veins .
Nor fed her waning light with borrowed rays .
Fearing lest his strength should fail him ,
A fever comes over me , sweeping
And with his father work us a perpetual peace .
Turning each dusk to silver . a pure light ,
From hateful time if prisons set us free .
Your rhymes , i laid them up in cotton ;
And guests in prouder homes shall see ,
Hear and regard the caution thou hast given ;
Confusion on thy banners wait ;
And though much bitter in our cup is thrown ,
Sounding , and feel the future air of flowers .
And gave the wretch some heavy blows ,
No mirth was shown
The lone night-fisher plied his oars .
The wretch who gave him just offence !
So fell he mourning , mourning for the dame
Big shadows leapt the ceiling from the flame .
Only to flatter fools , and make them bold ;
Fresh taxes still on taxes grew ;
Now all thy charms apply ;
With words like these , she carried her design :
Of what once blooming joy canst thou find trace
The dust replaced in hoisted roads ,
That whatever storms descend
New grace from other worlds was given .
And , like a wanderer turning to his home ,
A tenderness that call 'd them more severe ;
To my lands he brings destruction ;
Tell him just how she sealed you , cautious ,
And share the rich castilian throne .
She poured her love upon him , lit her soul
Rebellion roused , revolting ramparts rose .
Eyes were made for beauty 's grace
This unexpected thrust went to his parent-heart ;
" thy kingdom come " has been my prayer .
Kiss me , though you make believe ;
That well he note the man , whom crowds decide
Prepared in deadly strife to close ,
The thought beyond great poets not expressed ,
Another sense will make it range ,
Daily we wrought and daily we thought ,
And yearn 'd to tread its winding strand .
Now my mind is filled with sorrow ,
For even compassion has been found a crime .
For darkness holds its ancient place ,
When the book came , the devil sent
Shalt bear a dusky son who shall be called
And leafy shade around him threw .
The cheek that scarce a smile assumes ,
Disconsolate , long since adventure fled ;
To curled euphorion or anaximander .
And as centurion carried well his prime .
Torn with shell and pain --
As in an after verse will be made known ,
Blest with the bliss he freely gave .
To use great feelings and passions of the human family
Here came the proud milesian ,
What perfume comes balmily o'er us ?
But his own hands upon mine eyelids laid .
For his strength allied to goodness .
With argus wings arose ,
Not severed by long leagues of lonely land ,
He had an appetite , which always tends
Within we hold the wake for hopes deceased ;
The mountains hold communion ;
Cheese are seeking to and fro . "
With it i fill my lay ,
Her rippling laughter floated through the room ,
Their banquet tables spread with feasts of truth
Which makes all styx through one small liver flow .
In wild lament his sorrow told ,
A pretty babe all burning bright
And terror crept behind .
To feel the sun , to taste the rain ,
Who seeks and finds adventure , high and low ,
His spreading fingers shoot in verdant leaves ,
Towards the virtue still which followed me
The stars came out in the cool still air ,
And take a life immortal from my verse .
To his blue hills that rose in view ,
With the dead boughs that winter still must bind ,
That in a lonely tent had cast
Turning to thee , divine philosophy ,
The seal hermetically sealed till monday --
The boy keeps solemn vigil , while outside the wind
So weary with long sand sifting ;
When friends deplore my faded youth ,
So the lonely years go by .
His life fled with his remedie ,
Here , a palace deftly wrought
Her lethal beauty crowned with twining snakes
That vanished with the morn .
Since i rose out of child-oblivion
And make it fair for paradise ;
Bringing us faith to find our way
The veil , and forward plunged into the deep ,
Deep evidence that brow by learning lined ,
With the eye 's spirit running forth to meet
Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark ,
Found her or selfish or unwise .
Truth only needs to be for once spoke out ,
But in his home all grief and darkness found .
That constance held affection to the veil ;
We took a turkish vessel which conveyed
A softening shade from sorrow came ;
The tawny-hided desert crouches watching her .
The cry of a gull sent seaward
The infant takes not kindly to the breast ,
On human hearts he bends a jealous eye ,
And makes life 's current smoothly run .
Nought awaits thee now save trouble ,
They played till they all fell silent :
I see how victory , how conquest flies . "
Whatever brawls disturb the street ,
And spoke these words to suit the need :
But hope fondly whispers it shall not be so ;
No , -- she went by monarchs slighted
Thank you , pretty cow , that made
For the deceitful counsel which he gave .
And love , in tender dropping showers ,
But whigs came like a frost in june ,
Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed
Whose wings shall rise to the doors of gold ,
The weight of colour in her tresses weighed .
And now from far the mingling clamours rise ,
In vain i strave in beauty 's chains ,
A rotten liar , who inspires lies . '
That leaves the west all crimson with the promise
And the hands -- the hands that pressed
Full to the wind the swelling sails he gave ,
Tenfold precious the vengeance that comes after lingering years !
Is it not glorious the light that gilds
What the morn had taught .
Her empty dwellings ? comes the bridal pomp ,
O god of wisdom thou hast made the country :
Then on it runs like trailing vine ,
That steadfast , mournful strain , consoled
Happiest are those who high the banner bore ,
Satan had not to answer , but stood struck
And all those airy silks to flow ,
The morning came . to the park of the peer
And the kind , simple country shines revealed
Wisdom , though fled far away .
How all our copper had gone for his service !
Save those for which the mind prepares itself .
Their rustle might attract some wakeful ear .
What joy her thoughts in his arrival find .
The dewberry dipped for to work delay ,
With darkness ridged the riven dark .
And toss their manes in stormy strength .
Nor knowledge ask , unless it come
The corse amidst his weeping friends they laid ,
She lights , and bids the cloudy mists recede .
Which in dull crags of darkness had arisen
The jealousy his choice will stir ;
In echoing roars their answer gave .
Your war-worn features scan , --
Joy and true prosperity go still with thee ! '
Then to the skies your mounting soul shall go ,
Oblivion mocked , then pointed to a tomb ,
The leafy grove that covers :
Pleasure and wealth , were summoned to her side .
And i recall forgotten days .
Winter calls his northern breeze .
Tears , with laughter coming after ,
To speak the scorn that in him burned .
Though dire misfortunes every step attend ,
And fluttering pendulum , now this way swung ,
When awful war 's battalions thundered by ,
Or almost all that is , hurting the hurt --
Which to their corses came again ,
Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate .
Down to earth 's beaming eyes descended ,
Yet warm love finds a room
Peace , by its battles told ;
Such power pan 's grief hath to oppress ,
And the heavy rain beat down the flower
The prize that should his life destroy ,
And end so sorry business ere woe came ,
That filled the field scarce brought him to confess
Each thought filled just a spinal column .
A new year takes his throne .
Before they settled to sleep again .
Their farms produce them such high price ,
That madest me follow glory 's theme ;
Staying the scimitar , that hung malign
Have caught the very colours of that night !
From the river winding clearly ,
To venge that cruel outrage goad and fire .
Has found but scant demand .
But think you 'll find some wisdom i n't ;
And soon the ball was lost .
His foe to strike one blow no leisure hath ,
As hurrying down the headlong torrent goes ;
The fullness of the glory here unfold ,
And yet , such joy does in that craft abide
To pray , repent , and bring obedience due .
And little birds break out in rippling song ?
There 's a triumph in urging a glorious cause ,
Much of his wealth at your feet will place --
And weakly yield to passion ’s sway ?
He raised his eyes and found himself alone
So still it lay that every day
And bored through his breastplate strong and thick ,
And to repentance and confession turn 'd ;
Of that combustion quivered an effulgence ,
That round the warrior cast a dreadful shade ;
Which seems to me to breathe such melody
Till balmy rest your wearied strength restore .
Please ma’am i ’d take my oath ,
Thirst to shed blood , in every breast increased ,
Where every one can point and stare .
With rent petaled clouds that played
And in murky places hid it ,
That polyhymnia and her sisters made
Forever , leaving few to doubt him ;
Which the veiled prophet destined for the skies : --
Infinity to dwell .
Out of my stony heart has struck a tear .
While the high pageant of their hearts prepared .
To which their journeys long they had addressed ;
O'er which his grain is going .
But by his knights still cruel wars maintained .
The genial meads assign 'd to bless
And thrice like a wounded dove she came
Pink and white drifting of petals sweet ,
The fear that shook her frame .
And the indies about us we carry ;
To these disorders first undid the gate ; "
The tidings of sorrow sunk deep in her heart ;
Or the two sides in peace and friendship join .
To rest on the flowers of paradise ,
The legion is the legion while rome stands ,
And well i knew what the demon meant .
And in did come the strangest figure !
That she thy career may with roses spread :
A pitcher known in the days gone by
Such as i , unhappy , carry ?
And only the voice of the winds maketh moan
The lofty code which made the indian 's guide ;
And now as christians publicly they stand ,
His huge head with the life it bore ,
And her heart comes near to breaking ,
Above whose breast twin whispers float --
Life 's late forsaken houses all lay drown 'd
The motes that dance in sunny beams
An ' this war has gone to seed ,
A tongue to speak with answering heaven gave they .
Into my blood and spirit , swept me forth
The passion which the page would own .
The gentlest shade that walked elysian plains ,
Along the breeze with it drifts .
At length with bloodie eye fixed on her ,
To raise the mightiest armament ,
A word gone forth to scare the mighty gods ;
A moderate pension shakes full many a sage ,
Ring through the world with loud applause ,
Rouse but awhile , ere waning daylight flies ! ”
As i note thy varied charms
The faith and moral nature gave before ;
The moving mountains hear the powerful call ,
At dangers that they see ,
A hundred years are past and gone ,
As his harbinger swept past . "
The corn stood in sheaves
And rifted rocks whose entrance leads to hell ;
Intrepid , bursts the nerves , and tears the shaft
But sleep at last the victory won ;
That kill 'd many thousands but never struck stroke ;
Blank and discountenanced the servants stand ,
" treading the very soil our fathers trod , --
Thou place thy trust ; let not the entrance broad
As all their souls in blissful rapture took :
The settling hour was seen to pass ,
Torrent went thether ~ sone :
The vision came and went ,
" and there from morn till twilight bound ,
The gods assembled gave the king .
To send his warrant signed and sealed ,
Then straightway vidrik made reply :
To stiffen the gazing earth as stone .
I the happy hours will spend ,
Who war will wage with prattling innocence ,
And pity dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear .
Who bade the waves go sleep ,
That moaned as tho ' the tree 's heart broke
Thy hands have set me free . and all
Unto whose reaching sight heavens mysteries lie bare .
Glad welcome , toward his palace leads the way ;
The landscape now reveals a change ;
Doomed by the money he has saved .
Then crop the rosy hours that fly . "
And springs ran nectar , honey dropped from trees .
Stifled your soul , close wrapped from harm ,
Thy songs inspire and cheer the human soul ,
That all that saw forgot both ire and strife ,
Sighs and tears make life to last
" onaway ! my heart sings to thee ,
Give us love , and give us peace ! "
" is not the life you picked for me .
The strength of soul that builds up as with hands
That song 's plaintive cadence in distance died ,
Bowed with too heavy a burden of defeat .
Whose soul is touched with tender ruth ,
He freely o'er life 's path may roam .
As stagnant waters generate a froth ,
As mocks advice and takes a happy pace ,
To point them to the arduous paths of fame ;
Of glimmering silence that dead days fill .
Many did find their deadly scars ;
His potent arm stretched forth to strike
Is studded with its trembling water-drops ,
There came , shall i say , a snap --
It draws them on , they can not save
The vent ' rous captain gave command ;
This tempest come from angry war forthcast ,
With double-edged ax , it comes to pass
Who but myself shall cloud my soul with fear ?
Now , suddenly sloping his hurricane flight ,
Our hell of luxuries grated round with pride .
To me he made reply :
I have known how sickness bends ,
You see it stand completed .
The silver roofs the lofty notes resound .
They set a combat them between ,
And the raven his nest has made
And in whose veins no scottish blood had run ;
Are lost a thousand charms unknown ,
The space that lies between .
So grim and gray i shrank from thought
And when , to share the joy she brought ,
Simplicity that knows no guile ,
Gray evening and the night had almost met ,
The red leaves fall upon the mould ,
Just where the ploughland joined the grass ,
Shall give her warning that we love .
When on thy lips his ardent kisses dwell ,
When to my son the rule is given ;
So had the trees that autumn-time laid down
The voice of prayer in tones which stirred
Fond fancy 's eye recalls the form divine ,
For which his loftiest wish can call :
When the breeze of summer night caressed it ,
' where night and desolation ever frown .
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes .
Twenty curious eyes stared at him ,
Each following night reversed the toils of day .
But turns his javelin to the work of death .
Heavy music-books were carried
Fevers fly at your simple say ;
And gave the poppy , to relieve all pains .
And both chiefs struck together . he the crest
And the dense tangled mazes unwind ;
Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart .
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
So it comes that we stand lonely
She laid upon a stane ,
And thus his scorn and hate expressed :
To rack the wearied brain .
Coarse and hard thy saviour lay ,
Faint day and the fainter life awoke ,
Had met the death he oft had dealt
Made others covet what they saw so fair .
And their sad spirits sank and fell ;
Chariot and horse , these gifts of thine to bear
Vanished , the miracles that led ,
That i have handled least , least looked upon .
And near i saw , bold issuing forth
Mine oath of love can swear thee
Then knit , and passed
Watchmen of whom our safety takes no heed ;
The winter comes on altogether too fast ,
His heart so heavy got ,
She passes for the paphian queen ;
From dulling mist his vision freed ,
Now comes the hour of parting for us ,
True science investigates and brings to human perception such
That nature puts to work the acting frame ,
Rise up and take your blessing , happy pair !
" as the lily 's chalice holds the dew ,
True lover kept the oath he swore ;
When were made the ether-spaces ,
" beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root .
And , as you state it , almost starving .
The awful depths that lay below .
Who found her fair .
And the blue of heaven bends near .
Fear-stupefied the rest remained .
Astronomy finds in those eyes
Our time , our term has come .
Our only tears shall serve to prove
Year following year shall only set
So thus with fair delapsion softly falls
Than such as doth to lovers ' words belong ,
Save justice leads there ! father , mother ,
They rush in fury ' gainst the pagan ranks
Let not life 's sorrows press you down --
Years , ere you stood up from rest ,
And sorrow take a purple diadem ,
Did any know thee save my heart alone ?
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame ,
To bear in trust the secrets of the world ?
The city ' of grief encompasses , which now
Great chieftain , who takest such pains
Thick branches bar the day
Old tunes my heart is playing .
No scandals made the daily press a curse --
There fall no tears like theirs that all men hear
The future tenour will to thee unfold . "
But they come back again to meet their doom ,
My song might shadow forth that saintly smile ,
The chief 's return should make the guilty bleed .
For , as my bearded chestnuts prove ,
A river of gold ran low at our feet ,
Filled at least a thousand hogsheads
A mighty silence wrapped the veld in dreams .
Weak soul , by sense still led astray ,
Hopeless , forgotten and lost in the snowdrifts ,
Who gave you the desire to dare
Which his smiling features tell ,
Take vengeance for the slain . ”
To the false light that treacherous fishers show ,
I bring a wish divine ,
Since bravery was paid in fullest measure ,
Saw scorpions rise to sting .
And took the morning on auspicious crest ,
Is frequently the worst mistake man makes .
Alone and sick at heart , and closely pressed .
Thus made reply : " he is indeed alive ,
How warm her dreamless breath does pause and flow .
The gates had broken , and the massive bar ,
The clouds hung low :
The conflict rages fiercely on ;
Hill beyond hill the road in sunlight goes ;
With pain and sorrow life is wrought .
Unfalling tears they held , yet so could please
Death comes to him with very cruel pangs .
First sir charles advances with phrases well strung ,
To lead me to his joy . --
The waking signal flashed of old
And a myriad suns have set and shone
But they hung the head of desmond
Has filled the west with light ,
So nigh unto the mark he went ,
Who thus so calmly bore his agony ?
A little oval glass that lay
Over my head the oak-leaves shine
Whereas if flame , already fashioned , lay
Exalted from the earth , thy soul sprang high
Where lines of deadly engines stand .
Sad and deep i hear it boom ;
The turtle to her make hath told her tale .
Which reaches to your knees and makes your bare
How rich a perfume do ye yield !
Of lapse and transgression which held us in thrall ,
Tho ' fortune 's frown still hunts me down ,
Redounding , made my agony the worse ;
And lighten the burdens which after years bear ,
See how they toss , with animated rage
The army as it streamed along ,
( so custom says ) must truth forbear ;
Sinking ' neath the swelling wave .
Whereby we make towards god with devocion
Dire was the wound the weapon made
And pleased he leads the dazzled sage to day .
I feel the influence of all potent fear ,
Now he melted them to pity .
To the following words his melodious voice flows in :
Sweet dreams of home my heart may fill ,
To bear the future fame of us , "
If bad , its tricks a secret keep ;
The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown
To feel the joys of fellowship restored .
And the marriage month is drawing very near .
As if a sleep upon the hours had crept ;
He comes with flute and psalm .
It takes my life and gives a little dream .
That kept the violets blue .
The honeysuckle clung deliriously .
Take heart ! the waster builds again ;
As a heart must be tried by pain !
Small wonder that be makes gallipoli
That the clouds may drop their honey ,
The redemption of sinners deluded ! the last
Oppressed we feel the beam directly beat ,
And as the clock struck eight just then ,
On those vast mounds that magic seemed to raise ;
When will creation 's groans come to an end ,
Cast thine eyes upon the sunrise ,
Youths who had come on riot bent .
And to celestial beauty gave
Nor where the garamantian turns the soil ;
Man ever plucked from paradise ;
That drew , the student said , its pith
He sent me here to cool my fire ,
With darting gleams and dense with livid soot ,
That every case must stand upon its merits ;
And the white cold mists rolled in ;
Was given one breathless midnight , to adore you .
Bearing afar my captured wife ,
The fate of a nation was riding that night ;
Now on the trojans had disaster come ,
With swelling rage and hate ,
That lies at the fit o ' the tree ,
Toward which the spirit longs to peer afar ,
Five scimitars , wi ' murder crusted ;
This world presents of topsy-turvy ,
No anchor ever was cast .
What spirit art thou , moving o'er the tide
( as the dire distances dissolved their veils )
Then his cold lips run all the body over --
O sorrow , then can sorrow wane ?
Love had made catherine make each lover 's fortune ,
" though his gaze never stirred
That parting planted sorrow in many a virgin breast .
And tallies the years as they run .
To find reality still rising up
And he spoke the words which follow :
Have wrought in thee ; surely but thirty years ,
Admitting motion in the heavens , to show
Find a quick way throughout the nation ,
Is founded every virtue , came to thee . "
As against the lattices drives the rain .
Then all my passions mingling fell in tears ;
Never such silence o'er the cloister hung --
And elm trees nodding at the stars .
But for each doubt he banished , one returned
There might arise some pouting petty care
Of steps had worn a way . not verdant there
Bearing its load of healthful energies ;
That a people who sow defeat they will reap the
But nothing so like beating on a box .
My mother pitying made a thousand prayers ;
Oh , sweet to follow him !
Foretell new storms to those already spent .
Of colors that flash ere they fade and die ;
The armoury where many a spear had stood ,
Yet more thickly packed with misery . "
And ply our tasks from trouble freed .
Three weeks at least had come and gone ,
That gleaming broths in anger wrought ,
Yet , while the raging tempest is defied ,
And lay down in her loveliness .
When the sweatin ' troop-train lay
Or catch , when daylight 's last rays wane ,
For whom my victims bleed , my vintage flows :
The fancied fabric melts away ;
The spell-bound ships stand as at gaze
When morning skims with crimson wings
I guard her beauty clean from rust .
The spring calls and beckons with gracious insistence , --
That made the world rejoice .
Affection bends the judgment to her ply .
Ere the fire is out , are met ,
It pulsed with all the anguish of despair ;
And merry laughter rang throughout the hall .
Sure love with love for faith will burn ,
And with that wound sore anguish came on him :
The dauntless brow that grief itself had steeled
The god who dealt with abraham as the sons
The threshold , fame declares the pillars shook ;
But only served to hinder and to tire ;
Till up in arms my passions rose ,
Then it would follow that if i were dead ,
Is sweet as spring can hold within her walls .
Like rich men that take pleasure
Summer came in the country ,
-- no , no , this sorrow shown
Which brings the message i shall see with fear ,
In trailing radiance , rose and red ,
Tumbling about , at her own guidance lay ,
Comes on some perfect truth , and looks and looks
Am broken by the chariot-wheels of doom .
And took his leave with unfeigned sorrow
At whose dread name earth trembles ; who can look
Of friends and of assistance stood in need .
Upon him sir swerkel his red mantle throws ,
Warm , true hearts , which welcome thee ,
It leaves the haunts of happiness and rest
I found them bliss ;
What joy you brought into my loneliness .
When poverty is seen from them they fly :
And blood and fire have run in mingled stream ;
Much illness springs , so doctors note ,
Bring but the meed of trust ;
Which then and there receives the stroke : as flies
And give to rapture all thy trembling strings .
Where the pensive throats of the shy birds hidden ,
A finish 'd whole what boots it to present !
And the carriage rocked with laughter
We may follow a phantom the arid miles
And angry lightnings flashed across the gloom ,
Was spun this song that stills each listening leaf --
Did we not stand to the conflict ?
They shine on every lovely place ,
Lift me , guide me high and high
Seeing what dreadful work it leads to ;
Our power extends not equally to all .
Streets coming fast ,
And deeper waves receive the sacred freight .
In solid gold the purple vintage flows ,
To the child 's voice given : --
That came in neptune 's plea ;
Pray that your hopeless heart may win them !
Here will i dip my burning hand
For endless industry . when day was gone ,
Giving as much of ardour as it finds .
That stands forever in my past .
Should make these miseries to thee no news .
' god gives me one hour 's rest ,
The thoughts that arise in me .
A glorious noble kernel it contained .
The cymbals sound before the steps that come
Until at last she hit upon a place .
Our cheated cruisers search the waves , our captains
That 's bound in love 's soft spell ;
And the place upon the target where it went .
They make the spirit in the body quiver ;
While sin therein remain 'd ; --
Upon him , eating out his heart with grief
Sounded aloud . the peal it blew had made
Will make death clear or make life durable .
That joys the foeman ’s life to take .
Then tell him thus -- hostility shall burn ,
And doctrine newly brought to town
What sorrow dictates , but no word found way .
To hide the fraud . at interview both stood
For the swift steed runs not so fast alone ,
To think of the cool cruelty that sank
She loves to feel the tears upon her cheek ,
And downward shattered to the pavement flung them .
Union cemented for this nation 's weal .
Smell of brine his nostrils filled with might :
Where feeble tapers shed a gloomy ray
The rising tempest puts in act the soul ,
To shake thy senate , and from heights sublime
Who finds himself , loses his misery ! "
Let the lone fragments feed the fire !
I can still feel the spirit that bore us ,
And sad tears fall as i see him yield .
Answered in the words which follow :
Punishment . it came slowly
Where god stood manifest to man in her ....
And every burning breath he drew
And aspiration , though not put in act ,
All dreadful glared the iron face of war ,
And one of them , who felt himself annoyed
" the passion which she bore the lord , preferred
Such notes as bards in heaven alone can raise ;
That is my comfort , following shock on shock ,
For round the temple rolled the clang of arms ,
The fountains murmur , and each loftyest tree
An unknown knight thou see ’ st in me ,
The sun lies hot across his back ,
I hear the joy that bids each sorrow fly .
And still a life of guilt and sin pursue .
Fresh confidence infused . then hector smote
As arthur 's days are coming to an end ,
Here lie the types , in curious order rang 'd
Admiring numbers follow with their eyes .
O withered body , nature gave
The hungering hills feed full upon the sun ,
No art could save me from the grave .
You may catch sight of marian and prince john
Bearing in his arms the winnings ,
And curious changes of vision take place --
Even against the way its waters went .
Her mother 's solitary cottage stood :
Men conclude never a bargain without making closest inspection ,
Of those , who load them with committed sin .
Who dares forgive what none can overlook ?
With filth obscene , and dropping putrid gore .
My wealth is gone ; i offered it to him
Where never a road had led , --
And take its fill of heavenly bliss .
And with my voice their motions led . "
Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief ,
The frightened moon escaping from the storm .
And in words like these expressed him :
Than the fiend should bear thee home . ”
Shall i admit that nothing can restore
As quickly the pretender 's cheat they feel ,
What unapproved witness dost thou bear !
Then music left her golden sphere on high ,
But fair columbia brings her wreath of woe ,
Whom only death would treat as the equal
In the miracle must come in for a share .
Yon rising moon that looks for us again --
Until my tears , still dropping , wear
Then , caught with madness , in gigantic leap
Bow 'd down . the day fell dim
And round them ran a yellow border too ;
Wrong ' st nature to cast shadows over youth .
The frost that freezes the life at my heart ,
He spread upon waterloo 's ripened grain ;
Shall flourish , by no second adam lost .
Forgiveness of the majesty it braves .
New pleadings to new conjured gods arose ;
The clear mellow sunlight , in quivering streams ,
It lies from heaven across the flood
Silent and straight the waters run .
That nods to every wind that passes o'er
Her small white hands gave hearty cheering .
That nature forms a rustic taste so nice .
The mighty debt that him to leo tied .
My blessings fall in snow ;
When we for hopes of honor lose
If need be , share her sorrow !
But with a thrust an answer sharp she made ,
In chrystal currents poured from the hills
Hath come as vengeance wins the race .
Without the power to stand the shock
Of love were ripening to be pressed :
And not wash away the pain :
He makes protest of loyalty !
Our faith was pledged . but vivian would not go
A vastness , as a neighbor , came , --
He broke my sleep with sorrowing ,
After she saw the oath was nullified ,
They hide among my letters ,
But sorrow , and a care that almost killed ,
As the vision , that lured him to follow ,
Sages cast down the gods , to change the void
Incredulous , declared my story madness .
Bid fancy slumber , and steal away its potency ,
For all had flown who made it so --
Hell sees the victor come at last ,
Nor signal of abatement yet has shown .
Shall feel your ruling passion strong in death :
Out into the west as the sun went down ;
Ah me , for all earth rears ,
The kestrel hovering by day ,
Here sanctities and high saints stand ,
And her eyes were filled with tears
Let no cold railing 's shadows fall
Drawing from it such shrill wailings ,
Conviction to the serpent none belongs .
A brand of fire upon her heart would trace .
That breaks his magic chains at curfew time ,
That love to him the dame no longer bore .
And purge his own pollution with the flood
His falling bulk his bended arm sustains ;
These that swept at the sound of the trumpet
Of floods that swell and rave .
Nor thy wisdom lost in ether . "
Honor to woman ! to her it is given
And all the craggy mountains yield .
Ape the great despot ; throw in pompous tone
E'er felt affection 's holy fire ,
What could it be that made me find
There lies the shore that bids us hope success :
Whose capture gains a mighty price ,
Her sorrows share , and make them less ?
The portrait fills each feature , making swell
Which added doubly to my former fear .
No bloom gives such
A dart that laughed at distance and at speed .
More than eye can count .
And share the sadness that is ours to know .
I do believe the bad must go
The father 's rigor who kept pure of blot
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought ,
Loaded with loud lament the lonely gale ,
And the drawn light her features of grandeur unveiled ,
Though man 's proud brow were bound with flowers ,
As shuddering nature felt the powerful call ,
In heavenly trance make known thy perfect will ,
With frames infirm and tender , so there follows
That sets a gloss on what 's amiss ,
Light , winged hopes that come when bid ,
There comes the good lord president ,
Knowing , what all experience serves to show ,
In the very words which follow :
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking :
That nature hung in heaven , and filled their lamps
While false philosophy growing old
His aching temples swathed .
The day is come when i again repose
Of pitying weakness swept me , and i bent
“ or this , or instant send his guilty soul
Some burning thought go free .
There as my listless limbs are thrown
Illusion , thus passed over unobserved ? "
Why of the heritage no portion came
" to gaze upon those perfect charms ,
( the plain beside with mangled corps was spread ,
Along his ribs the pagan 's spear doth glide ;
Till the night again hath fallen .
Then from the breaking clouds fell torrent showers ;
Streams , yielding fair steeds , renowned graces ,
But to the work lent willing heart and hand .
And owe destruction to a prince like thee . "
With golden moss . his every sense had grown
About its mother 's heart , and brought
And right shall rise triumphant over wrong ,
My feeble faith still clings to thee .
Upon the frail clear light there shed ,
Awoke such solemn thoughts as suited well
That charm that can the strongest quell ,
" no marriage hints -- all goes on badly --
As if by serpent-torch of furies led
From earthly chains , the soul immortal feels
Saw the signs of bad-luck lower ;
By feeling his own whip .
Where stern antaeus held his brutal sway ,
Success in equal balance hovering hangs .
Beside the vessels took their ev ' ning cheer .
Some what unto my purpose apply
But yet more sensibly this truth to show
Nor come the heavenly sun and bathing blue
To found an empire in these new abodes ,
I think my heart had sucked their beams from them
To which they bring their pains and prayers ;
And the maenads dance with flying hair .
Let us form a sacred compact :
Still follow fortune where she leads the way . ]
Its altar with their offerings spread ,
The danes went clamouring ,
As if to itself the quiet forest smiled .
Then he turned , and , flushed with victory
Dancing , dancing , suddenly flickering and quivering
And christ would take no pity on
Set down their hopes , and are made
Of wakened joy that stirs in every tree
Forced its reluctant lips to one more vow .
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell .
And gave them virtue never to be spent ;
Along the breathing woodlands moved
To make his retreat ; to make his retreat .
Or mellow light be shed
With a trail of blood , marking his way
Unearthly melodies were born to make
Blood from his foot : then over it they laid
The hills with the sweet mournful music were ringing ,
Makes the wild day glad to sing ,
O love that lives through all the years ,
Twenty curious eyes stared at him ,
They lay them low on biers reclined ;
The deadliest sin her mind could reach
Will take acquaintance of my woes , and say
That it should not find destruction .
For his agony to pass ;
But age comes on ; with sudden shock
At length old age came on her
Draw vengeance on thy guilty head ,
Their silken banners waving o'er the tide ,
Lies folded in the deed that went before .
But where the sun came colored through
For as the evening falls , the fever rises ,
The fates compel . welcome to him was death
John found his spirits , and forgot his cares .
Frail joys adam holds dear . one only boon
His eyes are as a kindled spark
What following sorrow may on this arise :
Then let us make haste to be friends again ,
Meanwhile by peleus ' son patroclus stood ,
Remember your chiefs by his hatchet laid low .
From thee the borrowed glory came ,
And not a rent made by the gale !
" o soul that goest to beatitude
Their accents did resound .
Come , for the land ye love , to form
Of solomon he led by fraud to build
That thy departing , leaves me desolate ,
There comes a sound of marriage bells . "
Could follow the fierce , ravening flashes ;
With heart of springing hope set free
Gives promise of wider benefits in larger abundance .
With the bright palpable shapes our song creates :
That they may not find misfortune ,
Right must gain might to conquer and to reign .
Perhaps on the whole it might bring me luck ,
Music-laden , swept the chords
Since nature made us not more fond than proud
Marking the minutes as they slid away ,
To make his fellow mourn ?
Of habit formed in early day ?
Chiefly god 's love does in it live ,
But from thy deep emotion i can see
To thee made darling music , wild and loud ,
Shame bred desire a sharp revenge to take ,
No voice says aught ; no spark of light
The fall of kings that treasure might have stayed ,
The tempest now may smite , the sleet
Dreadful his fate , that strikes confusion 's blow ;
Full of the riant mists that turn to white
What a great day came and passed !
Have real existence ? whence came our thoughts ?
Quite happily , with thin hands filled with flowers .
All england held her breath in one grim doubt ,
This mighty wrath in either warrior stirred ;
The sand , nor blindly rushes on his foe :
Teach me a song to reach a heart
Maybe they 'll get it when i go
Into existence , as thou art addressed !
The streets resound with dancing
Quite melted into tears for thee .
And he wove it into stockings ,
Go while my world is filled with happiness .
That made thee mine , beloved ! eternally ,
But the blood that follows the discipline .
But heaven , that brings out good from evil ,
But has helped to shape her stately mien ,
Before the stars have left the skies ,
My agony made the willows quiver ;
And to the hermits made reply :
Like two flames that lovingly entwine ,
All the woodlands ring with music ,
As if they wished his cares to soothe .
Love 's gift to lay at jesus ' feet .
The snow may lie upon our hair
Quelled panic with authoritative calm ,
And in the snow-white streams it sheds ,
That thy calling came from anger ,
Then bind love to last for ever .
Then retiring fails to save ?
Where various lightsome colours gaily flare ;
The moving crystal from the fountains plays ;
Whose sorrow she had made her own .
To move her lover , a coquetish miss
But since these cosy hours will soon be gone ,
It makes it hard to go .
The soul of nature sprang , elate ,
No splendor rests on any mountain height ,
Seized also , with his lash plying severe
Some sad fate will overtake thee . "
Let your aid be freely given ,
And the leaves of the autumn made a frame
He spoke ; the spirits from the sails descend :
Where lines of noble courtiers stood ,
Those can not say that they are virtuous .
For love and thee my heart is throbbing still .
Till darkness closes from the sky !
So still it lay that every day
So tempting our sport , men think it atones
Adding then , by way of jest ,
Like shady forests rising on the waves .
And felt well pleased whenever they did come .
Love by _ hope _ is still sustain 'd ,
And break the letter open which she gave . "
She stole the whiteness of the snow ;
Then the last charge went blindly ,
Night will come , ( for come it will ,
Ere despatch be made by joe .
And now the south wind flung it to the north
Complaining , and spewing , and cursing his luck --
Following my footsteps , could not live again
Of wealthy farmers share the fertile space ;
If of this doctrine thou extract the sense ,
Thy woods this autumn day , that ache and sag
The cock sang merrily ;
Fearless , while others meet the shock of fate ,
Is this the thing the lord god made and gave
And dark the mournful moorland lay .
Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
That all things hold of deity .
For the red spark has shot downward ,
Where nine locks secure the treasure .
Every shaft , as it flies ,
The thought was happy -- and designed
And gulfs you never passed , gape death ,
These hold for me unending charm ,
Trees borrow tongues , waters in accents fall ,
Away goes the butterfly ,
Was led to take a proper view of death --
For on the battle 's fiery edge they stand .
And all the craggy mountains yield .
Who first professed by it to be made free ,
A tangle of high masts and shrouds that blocks
Where street lamps cast a wavering fire .
And pain that yearns upon the passing hour
And the changing cycle moved on ,
Upon this side with virtue it descends ,
With love wrastlede and was overcome :
Two temperate regions lie , where heat and cold
Where the spider spins his web in grim seclusion ,
Returns to be made whole .
Yet such attend on fortune 's frowns ,
The little deeds that , living , come and pass
Give thou no place to nature in thy thinking ,
A fiery ball each on the engine throws ,
What sound can break the silence of despair ?
And sent both hands to terror-smitten eyes ,
But our blind reason sees not where it lies ;
And filled his soul with gratitude anew .
Whose loveliness lives on , and does not fade .
It gives a very echo to the seat
And thus thy mother ’s voice obey .
Or won to what may work his utter loss ,
Sweet with the scent the lotus gave ,
The dawn comes up like a primrose girl
So warm the haze that spreads o'er everything ;
Or would they go on aching still
I turned to the murmur : the clouds swept asunder
When mary stay 'd beneath . but not to deal
Which give fallacious matter to our doubts ,
Then hector ’s mind he fills with dire dismay ;
Where snowdrops pushed at the first thaw .
Had passed and left me quiet , somehow it seemed
In iron gauntlets : break the council up . '
Feeling the wifely burden that she bore .
That each might bear his portion of the guilt
Does he study the wants of his own dominion ?
Her breath makes music , chaste and wan .
My sickle reaps the lurking stars in air ,
Old time and nature their changes tell ;
But we left him alone with his glory .
I am the fool that led the world astray ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
That brought into this world a world of woe ,
But to us comes no cheering ,
To build his haughty throne . ye western powers ,
Else thou mightst see how harsh with me
Wherever the soul of wit hath flung
Our life is short , and our days run
Of that scared rabble , should escape with life .
Unknown , which human knowledge could not reach ;
Their darkening souls whose light grew shade
Was howard 's corse by faithful hands conveyed ;
The radiant gemme was brightly set
Do i not know whose love enfolds us ,
But drinks to draw fresh courage for his journey .
But there , where western glooms are gathering ,
And falling asleep , while indulging his grief ,
My sister ’s holy waves are hurled
A web of lies let stranger weave for stranger
Witch-lights mocked at me on the fen ;
Think of what follows ; think that at the worst
My spirit flew in feathers then ,
Will make the farmer run away .
And call new beauties forth from every line !
Fulfilling the promise i willingly made .
Pain , scorn , and sorrow bore ,
That palely comes and covers all .
The cows by sudden fear are stirred ,
Cast vigorous plants and shrubs aside ,
Till the snow on that peaked alp aloof
Before his eyes the vision seems to stand ,
And smiles on others track 'd to tears alone !
The looking on it lifts the heart like wine .
His starry nights are tents of peace unfurled :
To thee the soul of prayer this morning turns ,
Ten days we 've floated fearfully ,
And the pine-boughs shine like silver ,
The worship of that love through thee made known ?
She heaved a sigh , and wiped her eye ,
And gladness will gleam over loss ,
At 's lost my heart , ye see :
So once were ranged the sons of ancient rome ,
An ' solemn congregations gazed ,
The language of my people , ages gone .
According to the virtue it conceives ,
And good may ever conquer ill ,
Sweet thoughts that through the soul do sing ,
But here his honour touched the monarch deemed ,
With honour led him to a seat ,
Hacked from his shoulders . next by frauds prepared
And closed each rent the shafts had made .
When impious folly rears her front on high ?
Resplendent , flashing terror on the greeks ;
Should break his bonds and injure damsel more ,
That bind a moment , and then leave us ,
My reader 's attention to turn ;
That scarce is conscious hope , but mocked and crushed
Than the thing those letters mean .
Then strange memories crowded back
I dropped my manners and snarled and swore ,
Let vassals follow where they lead ,
Radiant palace -- reared its head .
The like misfortune had not chanced before ,
Feels its sails swell haughtily
Whom death once grasped but soon restored .
Where maiden laughter winged the flying ball ;
And they set him afloat ,
To see profusion that he must not share /
The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung :
Her faithful powers have filled their task ,
The priceless gift of faith that you were giving
The night we reached this island green ,
The cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape
Think dat i ai n't got good sense !
A bloody stain on every line she drew ;
May not remember , much less tell the sound .
To pay thy kindness grateful due ,
But joy will yet come with the morning light ,
From stranger harps such hallowed strains could call ,
Laying the sunny leas ,
Nathless do ye still loud her praises sing ,
With flame and fiery vengeance sped ,
The burning rays that mine pour into ye ,
Of clouding sorrow from thy brow will chase : --
Naughty little noses , pray lead them home !
A sudden hubbub shook the hall ,
Security hast render 'd me , and drawn
Then , best of all who go to bliss ,
Around , wide gardens spread their pleasant bowers ,
Ready to slip on his unconscious prey .
The ark , from its terrific voyage , rests
And black the tempest came ;
A prize that passeth to and fro ,
How thick they come -- how beautiful they seem !
Given to redeem the human mind from error ,
And sunken , searching eyes , who seeks ,
The fears that shake his trembling limbs , but sits
And felt a cool wind go like grace
Or god our spirits call .
To other strains our souls are set :
Putting forth your manly efforts ? "
How quickly breaks the spell that bound me ,
He could with ease bring all his thoughts to bear
All valiant dust that builds on dust ,
Outstretched , and swifter than his stride he found
And press the rue for wine .
His hand laid softly on that shining head .
And the hollow groan he gave
And winter wrapped the world in snow
There it securely dwells ,
As " blessings brighten when taking flight ; "
And death alone makes hate and love
When faith is virtue , reason makes it so .
I feel the freshness of the streams ,
Which i before my answer made , supine
For slighted counsel ; such thy future peace !
Are graces found so high and rare ?
But made by nature stern and grim ,
The worship of that love through thee made known ?
Silence comes , as o'er the valley ,
Ruler o'er the dead , they made him ,
The tears fell fast as she closed the lid
Her sorrows share , and make them less ?
The rose of may its pride displayed
For two made one may find three made by death
And faith still reigned within his breast .
To give me answer from her mossy couch .
In thee we trace a higher power ,
It tells of piercing woe , and dire dismay .
Wild uproar held ; while mars a giant spear
Till dark night over the meadows lay .
And yet , to show they 're true ,
And every soldier found a like reward
They come : and tens of millions swell
So fair a creature caught within
That justice may increase and spread .
Earth gets its price for what earth gives us ;
There came whisperings in the winds
St. george in radiant armour came
How hard to follow , with lips that quiver ,
Which falls upon the loved one 's bier .
In vain the cruel skies their hot rays shed ;
Bends low his head and counsel takes in thought .
There lies safety and there alone .
The mighty squadrons to that harbour brought ,
And hide no secret from you in my heart .
The sentence of thy early death contain .
Of all that set young hearts romancing :
Time -- the following evening .
Why not make horny eyes no thorn could prick ,
And make you tender unto human weakness ,
Hath bred or nourished in your heart a hope
Would wear forevermore the curse of cain !
To him , whose patience waited long , --
The bitter blast that round me blaws ,
For i felt assured she thought me
There went a fame in heaven that he ere long
Who poured this story out .
So have i painted her , you see ,
Like spring-showers , they 'll only make
Those thoughts that wander through eternity ,
Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture ,
The bare trees are tossing their branches on high ;
And that the rest had faced unto the right
Where she was seated , asking for a dance .
But well might miss their glitter in the light
Resisting the inertia that drags back
Your princely care your kingly wisdom proves ,
Take heart ! the waster builds again ,
Or raising a laugh with a flash of filthy wit
Then sending far his fearful roar ,
Ringing as with laughter , shining as through tears !
Like these the soul , for sunshine made ,
A smell of scorching enters in our frame
Thus showed his ready wit ,
The fog climbed slowly , blotted out the road ;
The connection of which the plot one sees .
Holding his faith at last .
To beg to lead her to this shrine .
They preach the true gospel sent us from above ;
To give effect , with memorable ill ,
Sees only such things rise .
And turns my love to frenzied pain .
To promise joy and give repose .
Who in kolo always takes the leadship ,
Slumber hath held the grove for years untold :
And you bet it makes a difference to him !
Spoke his mind in words that follow :
A fountain rippled in the midst , and threw
Religious horror smote the palsied horde ;
And from their bodies pass 'd .
Whose dazzling radiance far around is thrown ;
And what the motions that they give and get ?
Answered in the words which follow :
Broken beggars grumble when they sense people .
He saw a book that on a table lay ,
And feel the magic of his lips --
Making new year 's calls .
They find a paradise in every field ,
Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
All things come back to her , being free ;
Whose shoes made a horrible creaking ;
Marbles will swear that here it lies .
His office was advice to give
" then ghastly dreams , and hateful thoughts arise :
And shades of midnight gloom came down
Then death concealed its visage gaunt ,
That gnawed , has come to harm .
And a passionate humor seized him there --
And i feel , in the waltz that frolics
Slowly he woke ; life came back with a sigh
And melts them later into twilight dews ,
The sun 's clear song makes the horizon ring .
And , amid the tempest pealing ,
Here the arch cupid slyly seems to glide
It sit hir nought to be celestial
With pleasure he saw that the quarrels increased ,
And bore it through heaven on your golden cars .
Towers and battlements it sees
They seek to find in those they love
It drew the sustenance whereby it grew
But it chanced next day when the stunted pines
But warmly and softly it loved to caress
And up the snowy splugen drew ,
Though the wind hath fallen , they drift along ,
As if his heart could find no rest ,
There is no sound hangs in the solemn air .
Which once my love sat knotting in ! --
With grief renew 'd the weeping fair descends ;
And music that belongs
That instant went to caroline ,
The king himself holds all by his command ;
They came , and found no glory as of old
Twixt caucasus and atlas hills extended ;
The bells hang silent in the tower --
Behold bound me an unhappy god ,
The years of childhood passed away . i lived
Thy worn-out heart will break at last --
Along the road where god 's hand pointed us .
Her glorious fancies come from far ,
Mourn for the spirit fled ,
And england 's fleet approach 'd to meet
An eye for nature 's depths receive !
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew ,
And thrice came on in fury ,
Of many mourners rolled .
But satan clapped on his grudge a claw ;
That can get the milk from mana ;
Or , if some neighbor , flying from disease ,
A son , whose death he never saw avenged .
While his horrid mouth stood open ;
Has filled your canvas curves with rose ,
And followed by a sacred song )
From the marshes filled with danger ,
But on his car the slaughter ’d victims laid :
Its fragrance fills the earth ,
Of justice doth run counter to the edge .
And though he fill a lowly grave ,
The happiness of him -- who shared her lot --
To seek new lands and new creations run .
But with flutes of fear they filled the ear ,
The church alone , be it confessed ,
Would stir to noisy riot .
The hermit crossed his brow .
And dusky woodlands where the night came down .
And the song this shape suggested
But here my love would stay .
It strengthened a fate beset by fears
So blinded are the pair with spite and rage ,
What deadly poison has thy nature drank ?
Death on his brow no mark has set ,
If into other hands these reliques came .
That say thy sweet is bitter
At length , to calmer reason brought ,
Rich sapphire gems , flash with arcadian artlessness ,
Have gained relief from somewhere in the sky .
It will not own a nation so unholy ,
While zephyr 's fragrant breeze , soft breathing , stole
And lights that shine are shut again
Yet shall their tale instruct , if it declare
And where thou hast shown thy friendly feeling ,
Though its smoke shall hide the sun ,
Keeps faithful to the word he gave .
And saw the fires that dyed like blood the air
And with the flower 's loosened loneliness
And let my sad prayers rise ,
My few gray hairs will soon descend in peace ,
The blue hills melting into gray ;
The maid whose look my heart can thrill ,
To haunt the place where passions reign --
The lady 's smile showed no remorse , --
Coiling and twisting in my belly .
That hath kept watch o'er man 's mortality ;
In saving what would run to waste ;
These human tears now falling ,
O'er the world 's loud bustle rising ,
The open space that lay beside the brake .
Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet ,
That follows after food .
Made pass an angel of the dark domain ;
Wherewith a knight leads home his equal wife .
Till fancy coloured it , and formed a dream .
The martyr meets his fate .
For my passion overcame me ,
It never comes as light within the mind
Through branching beams thy fevered votaries come
The regiments of autumn stood :
While moons shall pass or starlight shine . "
I ca n't help thinking puberty assisted .
His ancient courage he recalled ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
When the clouds come deep against the sky
The roar of whose descent has died
All my soul holds dear ,
My fears in anguish roam ,
The delicate thought-wrapped buttercups that glide
Take pity on the lonely men
I once was pia . sienna gave me life ,
Her answer to the hero made :
The memory clings to pleasure as it flies ? )
Set upon him feith or credence .
Wherefrom to launch fresh battle on her foes ;
Thy fire my heart refine ,
In her blue heart reflected
" my soul has struggled to forget
The clouds that court them in a tear !
Against his blows he good resistance made .
But set to vaster harmonies , they run
Thoughts like these arose ,
And all the charms it knew ,
Through your shy spring kisses that clung to us ,
And the white cold mists rolled in ;
Live buds that warbled like a rivulet
The authority which i derived from heaven .
The rock and the stream it knew of old .
Th ' escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks
Where the spine joins it . not more furiously
The fog laughs low to see it go ,
Despair like africa 's black earth holds me ;
And are not given to fainting ;
That comes and goes in that scented air ;
Above a bay where fish-boats lay
I once hoped to pluck the fruits of life :
But deep the steel within his bones remains .
And where goes gain that greed amasses ,
As dear , and near my heart i set thee
The hawthorn soon will bear the wreath ,
His body where the bitter shaft had plow 'd
And well that lifelike portrait drew .
The hills in their old order ranged ;
From tuscan corythus in days gone by
From whom the answer came unto these words ,
There moved a terror under ground ; --
Sweet hue of eastern sapphire , that was spread
And grumbling winds that passed thereby .
' midst the terror round them spread ,
Starts to fell the stately aspen ,
A shadowy silken chrysalis whence should break
The rosy and elastic dawn , the flashing sun ,
The blossom that was made for joy and praise ,
Another time , and keep my temper down !
Back they flew , and reached their nest .
My bad luck brings me here , alas !
And put her fortitude to proof ;
That we mai take here evidences
By the weary road it came ,
Fire which shall make the world his own .
Not a wit discharged his farewell joke ,
Sin-weary , stained , forlorn ?
With his two arms outstretched to fold the world .
Why grew her heart so cold , so numb ?
And the legend , i feel , is a part
Emotion was struggling for vent in her heart .
Discipline rich thou hast brought ,
When apple sauce around the board was passed ;
The dying roses breathed their last ,
Upon the evening air their odours shed .
While yet thy father feels the woes he bears ,
Heaven sends to guard the golden age ,
As it wafts frae the roses ,
Like the proud eastern , struck by providence ,
And rising from the sickness drear ,
As fortune - _ hunters _ formed their train .
The listless palm-trees catch the breeze above
Strange things are hidden by that ebon veil ,
Or in the bed-rooms made a stir
Then a quietness falls over meadow and hill ,
From grief i find surcease ,
And i will fold thee in such downy dreams
Or is the hunger fed at length ,
And though upon him now there fell a sense
Direct toward him , threw her arms around
Now the land , with drying tears ,
In the blood that heroes gave it .
The chat on various subjects ran ,
This turn hath made amends ; thou hast fulfill 'd
That tell the hour when he shall graduate
-- " darest thou confront that fearful form ,
And now the cordial clouds have shut all in ,
Four seasons fill the measure of the year ;
The tears steal over the faded cheeks ,
She gave a thousand messages of love ,
Suddenly drops the gull and breaks the glassy tide .
That always shows great pride , or little sense :
Late at night his tune was spent .
And love itself at highest reveals
And growling in a group the music stood
Can crush all sense of beauty from the heart !
But not one word can speak .
And flits around earth 's brighter things ,
To calm the terror and grief we feel ;
_ no wisdom won with weariness ; _
The scenes of life before me lay .
Her loins brought forth , her fostering bosom fed
The chains of hell that hold his friend .
Giving way , proved an influence clearly divine ,
There hang more destinies .
The hapless hunter yielded forth his breath .
Fired with anger , threatened vengeance ,
Taking full vengeance on ingratitude .
Always in the night comes sorrow ,
His eloquent reply he framed :
And finding pastime all day through ....
Nor fell the tasseled plumes as satin soft
Spring 's bud , and autumn 's faded leaf ;
The lean red bolt of his body tore ,
In glory shall our souls made free ,
Who make it a rule to stick to business ,
With kisses that well nigh might smother .
And bear the merits of the dead in mind ;
How it is learnt another life must show .
Languid with music . then a step drew near ,
Stretching their hands and feigning love !
And france triumphant stems the subject main .
And the white body that lay by mine ;
Could never since find any rest .
They ' eard old songs turn up again ,
Like ripened corn-sheaves gathered in ?
And thee a covenant i will strive to make .
Let my soul its beauty keep
Slowly ebbed his life away ,
Alone gives aid to city charged with sin .
And long green thorns that stabbed and stung :
Her eyes ' distress had made
In depths below the terror felt .
And glimmering deeps of peace ,
The cool bath waited , with its marble floor ;
Of streams and waters that bear witness still
To hold the added sweetness of a song .
And one old age with all regrets is crowded .
Of hope to rise , or fear to fall ;
Tear-kisses hid the scars .
At the beauty in which she is set ;
That comes with steady sun when april dies .
And folly , doctor-like , controlling skill ,
It crept till it kissed a cheek so pale
To lend thy lamps to light a tragedy ?
The war has made her nervous , and the roar
In the still air the music lies unheard ;
Have been defeated by that pledge you gave
A little field that bears a little wheat
The milk it floats in great spring flood
To grasp so much come short in aptitude .
And found a dream of life and a solution
And felt his courage brighten into flame .
And striving me to find at fault ,
When every voice was tuned to mirth ,
And the maker less than that he made ,
In the land where the dead dreams go .
Than ever bow-string gave to whistling reed .
Which i have felt and fear 'd ,
And where new hearts with yours do blend .
Upon my saddening heart and i recall
Should have pealed with welcome , wales ,
“ mine thy applause may claim . at present grant
Is instant made no worth a louse ,
And sighs while she bends to smile and listen .
That our first tryst was set !
As well might smooth a harder life .
For making such a fool of self ,
No panic fear shall turn them ,
Where slavery rises , and where freedom ends .
Shall fill the field of mars ! what funeral state
And from the boughs brush off the evil dew ,
Christ shrive us all from self ,
The child 's arrival till the time came round
As a god , i set him above
Answered in the words which follow :
The christian trumpets give the deadly call ,
Whose flashing spokes , instinct with infinite life ,
Onward through life he goes ;
Which gives out flame , yet it its whiteness shines
But my heart in me turns and moves ,
Must something fresh for their advantage give .
But come , confession makes the conscience light ,
That hither brings you over barren seas . "
Through sin to death exposed by my exploit .
And there he put a habit on
He feels that life is ebbing from his veins .
Peace to the torn and bleeding land ,
Bats in the elm trees made a ghostly sound ;
A vivid pageant passing through the door ,
My foes shall wish my life a longer date ,
To grasp so much come short in aptitude .
Hast lost the power to know .
His face a melancholy so profound put on
Fold , and dissolve you in a last embrace .
He ended , and ( receiving as they pass
Reserved for men of deeper thought , and late ,
So be it , at least they are given
That gave him conduct to his peaceful land ;
His shouting days with mirth were crowned ;
With cheerful words allay 'd the common grief :
In silver rags the birches stood ;
Flashed a swift terror on the dark .
Soon low-muttering thunders growl ,
As if the corpse they keep were oozing through --
The waters hold all heaven within their heart ,
Thy oeconomick virtues sing ;
Such words as in the last despair are cried :
Evander 's house and progeny laid low ,
Or come to wrestling grips with fate ,
And their oblations on the altar laid .
I am the breath that fills the organ pipes
Not to wives are favors given . ' "
Wandering along , delicious music made .
The golden birds that ever sail the skies
And the red swords swing and slay . "
Another , with her maidens , drawing off
That they who make sport of us
But i will use my best endeavour ,
Let conquerors fight for glory ,
Until at length the sun sank low
The shadows gaunt they fall aslant ,
For the voice he placed within ,
His breast with burning fury fired ,
A silken veil , wrought with a paradise ,
As if it brought the memory of pain :
Young light sing in the lark .
No rushing glory , like a queen made bold ,
There shine the eyes that only see
Of vengeance filling all the air .
Draw through their life the same delicious breath ,
I am the worst one that i see .
Have you a doubt that contentment will come
And by thine interest turned .
For his heart is pierced with sorrow .
And a tear stood in his e ’ e.
When athens ' armies fell at syracuse ,
With all the host of greece , closing the ranks
They waste sae mony a braw estate !
Seven folds in circles on its face they beat .
Making new year 's calls .
That waked each new idolatry --
No prayer can soften , no appeal can move :
Most deeply feel thy pangs , remorse !
And then with anxious look pursued his road .
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
What strained touches rhetoric can lend ,
But burn through life with all its fires .
Gingerly she gains the door ,
The world escaping ? magnus ' fortunes lost ,
Lumps would rise upon her temples ,
That thy voluptuous traits came glimmering through .
In languor on my breast reposes ,
Deepened with sorrow , lined with simple care ;
That all the land shall look in holiday
Of the souls of men quench and grow still .
That makes us wealthy while it keeps us dull ,
And those that heard him sickened where they lay .
Oh , what a shout there went
For i with useless words prolong your stay ,
Would fade , as her voice ran on ,
I fear we 'll come to harm . "
The pictures as my memory took them . next
Heart of the world give heed !
But pale disease now gave the secret wound ;
In years that bring the philosophic mind .
According to the virtue it conceives ,
Which monster made it first and next a prey .
Their bravest struck with grief unbearable .
Into whose keeping christ did give the keys
The love i hold was borne by her ;
With heaven 's artillery fraught , came rattling on
To make up that defect : let rumours be :
Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
Lest it pass outwards in astonishment
These borrow a ' their finest hues
The drought of fluttering leaves had grown
That should contend for the appointed prize
Their fiery crests which flashed and glowed ,
He sighed , abandoning his charge to fate ,
And finds the scene whence tears eternal flow . "
And , as it works , the industrious bee
And makes me tell a thousand lies :
Fairest the vines that on ruin will cling .
Did on god 's altar lay .
Its boundary stone that clings so deep in time .
_ when the clock began to strike _ ! "
O happy you , if it hitt right !
Lo , in the universe our soul is lost !
Has age but melted the rough parts away ,
Out of the night that covers me ,
But that enormous barrier binds it fast .
Were death to follow , mine own the first .
That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs ,
Turning , they found love cold and still .
She wonder 'd such treatment he stood !
To loose all burden of old woes .
Here and there his heart would cleave
Seventeen kings follow him in a band ,
How should we look to trace the limitless roads
Under the dark and swiftly gathering gloom
Alone can draw the poison-fangs of hate .
Manteo 's heart glows with friendly remembrance ,
And as their eyes met his renewed blood
And shalt not thou to distant lands extend ?
" this passage made he , when he would suppress
Thus his word securely stands ;
And issued hungry on the plain .
And you can get good interest .
Of troubles that a single life attend ,
The earth that rises and the heaven that bends ;
Placed on her head than sleep came down ,
A passage thro ' the jointed arms it found ,
The fair each moment rises in her charms ,
No rest is rendered to the primal bodies
If beggars ’ rags were cash , you ’d see
Me an ' my lover , we fall out .
All melting ; though our drops this difference bore :
Life be at last revealed to thee !
Encounters grandpre ( next that came to hand )
And the hills are touched with purple
The which my drama cares not to rehearse ,
With blissful emulations fired .
That spoke that word and staggered pale as death .
Straightway we found all peril fled
The hungry flames that leapt and ran ,
Tears fell upon the page he read .
His arm swooped down and bore the head aloft ,
Life and death he drew as circles ,
Comply , which are subjected to thy sway !
Following the mighty van that freedom leads ,
The russet fields with frost doth bind .
Around their king a faithful guard they stand .
For out of depths of sorrow rose their moan .
These hirelings they 'll never stand ,
I have played with god for a woman ,
Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides ,
Now soon the waters meet and pair
So manhood comes -- and so it surely goes ,
That even now i hear thy brown birds raise ,
But feels the throb of ancient fealty .
To share the depth of heart-felt grief ;
Then rose a dream before my sleeping soul !
And managed with a minimum of rest ?
Know , my words their faults acknowledge ;
Inseparablie thine , to him shalt beare
Her clock has struck its morning hours ;
Unto what awful power shall i call ?
How to part those friends so loyal ,
Or turn to reverent awe ! for beauty stands
In our weakness , thy strength we may trace .
Before the years can make it wise .
That were a noble witchcraft simply wrought ,
Nothing whatever did it say to us ,
And every sea-breath drawn away ....
Tears that are shed over evil 's foul blight ,
The beauteous stars walk through the night ,
When the clock struck the hour for retiring ;
Pale contagion flies affrighted
To fade , a meteor , paying for the crime
Poet or patriot , rose but to restore
In the silence , shining bright ,
That the white objects shining to thine eyes
Why happiness pursued , though never found ?
The name that bore she . "
When a burning blush came o'er thee ,
Sorrows that dead hearts have wrung ,
Wide o'er the plains my realms extend ;
Should hold his head high , as you see .
One promised land my fancy filled .
That gives the soul its wings ;
He felt no love for either child --
That they their rest might with more comfort take .
The sweetest dews of night are shed ,
Those wholesome counsels which thy father gave .
When peace is hurried hence on rages wing ,
And what the walls the fates assign .
Music still came , but with it came alloy ,
Wheresoe'er their fate may lead them .
Found the winds were not in battle ,
Though sol gave warning of approaching night .
Large as any sheep you see ,
Not now inclined to utter oaths profane ,
" whither in reckless daring hast thou gone ,
Awhile they sorrow , then dismiss their care ;
Visions that memory alone can restore .
And crackling oaths went to and fro
Two childish hands had traced their names :
With _ flying colors _ in a waltz .
Many a jest told of the keys betraying
Across the lonely , drifting noon ;
In meadows where the downy seeds are flying ;
All his little hopes were dying --
Long winter 's trance . no longer rise and roar
But my weary wings could not follow my vision --
To give me answer from her mossy couch .
A year , and then you 'll pass it ,
Like him who felt affliction 's fire ,
Here where the waves wash the strand ,
Will a new leonardo arise on our ken ?
But , whatever the feeling that prompted the sigh
Take thou my blessing thus , and go
Before the battle made ;
Gardens . the word is overcharged with meaning ;
Now at length is come the summer ,
His varying moods all forms of speech employ .
With little cries at each discovered beauty .
Take courage ; entertain no thought of death .
Never show him the contempt that you must feel ;
Up johnson came , with hundreds at his back ,
Couched on the clouds that fiery sunset fills ,
That man was made to mourn .
Cold as the life that walks without desire ,
Our souls from coming near enough to blend ;
Found his crop of barley growing ,
Finding the law was full and plain ,
Miraculous harvests spread and rolled ,
They laid the index on his grave .
And ah ! what verdict then it bears ,
Shall hold my realm in bitter pain . no day
Their curls and cast the tribute on her tomb .
The grave sir gilbert holds it for a rule ,
Sugríva to his heart he pressed
And crafty plots will frame ,
That scarcely stirs the nodding leaves of trees ;
I see before me the gladiator lie :
By fire , to sink into the abyss again ;
These build as fast as knowledge can destroy ;
What means this outrage ?
But breathe revenge , and for the combat burn .
Courage ! lose not heart or hope ;
Gainst four assaults easily did they fare ,
" twice broken , he our armies overthrew
The battle 's fought , the victory won !
Give my hero joyful greetings . "
By gorgon 's head two hundred stiffen 'd stand :
The flame , that in his constant bosom burned .
Whose headlong passions form their proper woes .
In such a fight with keen defence lays on ;
A milky cloud went all to flame .
And who when called to joy lament and wail .
Old david would have asked for youth afresh
Thy glorious toils , shall through these seas unfold
No day shall return that has faded ,
And set in mystery , and devised for them
Of coming springs fall on the quiet grave .
It drives and sinks me to despair ;
Or give their acts and them eternity .
Where is now the smile , that lightened
Perpetually pricking the haze across the ground ,
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway ,
The shore is set , in mournful wise
No look of wild surprise the natives wore :
They come like dreams , like something remembered . .
Thy name , thy race , thy birth declare ,
Mother she brought a flush of tears
He set in his bosom a dove of flight --
That the time might pass more gayly ,
To tyrants , others have their countries sold ,
The shadow stands confessed .
When from the road a narrow path he took ,
In the still evening murmured ceaselessly .
Let fancy make awhile the duller ,
The storm is laid -- and now
Has given raiment rich and fine ,
" kalevatar took the splinter
From their furious jaws exuding ;
Describe or fix one movement of his mind ?
Leaving half one 's work undone .
So soon , so soon , the changes came .
And their little hands that lay upon the linen
Which sent a spirit marred and stained ,
That heave the struggling heart with wilder din ,
The stories told by stained-glass windows set
That laugh , as if transported with some fit
Or lose your chance of everlasting light . ”
But when the music paused , he ceased to shed
Secret spells were opened to me ,
Each stakes his claim and gives his reason why ;
Moved a mournful monotone --
And summer comes again with peace .
Like kings we lose the conquests gained before ,
Down from the gardens of asia descending radiating ,
Which here hath turned a little time for rest .
From brotherhood the one way upward leads .
And the boldest held his breath ,
But to each hungry soul thy love would fill --
Breathless as one a brooding nightmare holds ,
The wind goes shivering with cold
On memory 's scroll there came a blot ,
But wisest fate says no ,
No later light has lighted up my heaven ,
The quiet spot that suits him best ;
You gave me love such years ago --
Which serves the happy couple for a tavern .
That sways above the berry bloom ;
The creeping tide of darkness rises higher ,
The stars came out on high , --
To make men worse by making my sin known ?
Engulf the glories born of perfect love .
And over his forehead in love it swept ,
These casting rocks like hail , and these
So he took his wings , and fled ;
That went up the trail from golden .
What comforting makes them strong ?
And dismal ruin seems to threaten it . "
It might have grown into a beautiful sorrow --
She show 'd a great dislike to holy water :
The sword alone can ease thee of thy pain .
Behind her the ghost of the winter stands ;
Having built and fired the generous heart and brain ,
In flashing arms ; louder the thunders raise
That burden heavier then the earth to bear ,
And the long line comes gleaming on .
From spirits tempered in heaven .
Which fills their future with alarming fears ,
Gray , heavy clouds muffled the valleys ,
It is my burning soul that cries ,
She , too , my youthful love returned ,
How should we look to trace the limitless roads
But the same fate the victor underwent ,
And robbed my failing years ;
The summer passed , the winter came ;
Thick shadows settle on the landscape bright ,
Pass a few days , and this dull darkling globe
She took the tried clay of the common road --
To guide the feet of peasants and of kings !
And fain had kept my eyes from the sad sights
The sun hath blushed the sea to wine !
With his bloody crest erected ,
And with them take the poet 's prayer ;
And strange tyrannic power he showed :
Of great democritus lays down : that ever
The blessed ! the indwelling ! that doth make
Of dian , framed by artists , who pourtray
When thus the genius of the water said :
Not with the love that lives upon her eyes ,
And lit the leaves and dry wood heaped with care
The hat given to the poet by li chien
For the dungeon walls , and the gloom that falls
No precept for virginity he found :
With the light his presence lent ,
And share the battle 's common chance with us
And to the grave my steps attend ?
As evening closes round his lyre ,
Till o'er this lovely vale it stands
Pushed off its petals to get room to grow ,
To the love we felt in ages past .
Then with a voice that well-nigh failed ,
I feel that the summer is all for me ,
Yet she much whiter ; but the same did hide
A heavenly music filled mine ears ,
But nothing good could come of it ,
Then , in such coats have shown their joy ,
Thrice tempered ' gainst a wayward world ,
With their fiery breath made answer :
Save that which cometh from the pure serene
All for myself the sigh would swell ,
To be a mother and give happy birth ,
Of loud authority thus quell 'd them all .
The deep-brooding slumber of silence that holds
Our own felicity we make or find :
Bowed at her message from the king of kings ;
Where willows shake their watery-sounding leaves .
Till earth did waver and fade far away
The sea , a sapphire sown with emerald ;
Hath power , directed thus , to bend elsewhere ;
Will in the end all life consume ?
And saw that trust and love and buoyant hope
Such silence waits on philomela 's strains ,
Here the lover of nature allows to discern ,
The increate perpetual thirst , that draws
All who turn to it . had this text divine
The grip of his purpose still held him ,
The same ambition can destroy or save ,
Why should my singing so make me to weep ?
I did not know what life meant till i felt
Till the sea gives up her dead .
Whose fame has gone through yon celestial clime .
So let me feel how soft your feet ,
Making cunning noiseless travel down the ways .
The pains i felt when late i bade farewell ;
My soul keeps all her trust ;
They go -- dark flecks of shadow drifting by .
Past the silence reaching ,
Man 's misery declares him born for bliss ;
Or hold as of like seed the goodly hues
In wrath , now prowling through the wood ,
While december rains were falling ,
Till the darkness falls around us ,
Along the land the winter 's doom is creeping
The trojans keep aloof the rising war .
A yellow radiance is shed ;
His faithful friends unhappy dares bore :
And the new age forgets us and goes on .
And earth self-balanced on her center hung .
Of songs seems borne . triumphant in this hour ,
And burdened with contrite prayer ,
That ever valor lost or won ,
Is sternly fixed on vacancy ;
For his star it shineth clear .
Ere the orb fills and all the sorrow flows .
Into his dead corpse they breathed their spirit ;
Fair thoughts followed me everywhere ,
They breathe the calm of death before they die .
Bathed in the mist , confusing earth with heaven .
For what your qualities are fitted ?
Princess , the moral 's here to draw :
The holy work begun to end they brought .
That stood aloof , one form by every tree ,
What fire was that which mounted to thy cheeks
Which heaven to gaudy day denies .
And takes the coin of pity as a cheat .
That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs ,
Despair moaned on the lips that said
And the rose yet living with blushes of red
Part the twin lobes , expand the throbbing gem ;
But certainly i made folk such cheer ,
No worldly distraction presumed to intrude .
And bliss gave more than beauty to his face :
And call up miracles of light .
Brief letters came from helen , now and then :
The lamb of god who takes away our sins .
Our melting flesh fixed beauty there , a star ,
Ne er lay entranced like thee !
Nor counts his day of toiling through
Thus die the fires that cupid lit .
Then turned in sorrow to this holy grove .
Dare to think , though others frown ;
That proudly he a captaines name assumes ,
On sundays i can take no rest .
So much still shines on us the sovereign ruler .
That he may wage in peace his mimic wars ;
But added , that , the evening being calm ,
Is not the immortal author made a god ?
Hissed by the rain and beaten down to darkness .
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame ,
You brought yourself into these woes .
Which makes me sing when i should cry
Must rise with hope and sink with fear ,
Let loose to tell of victory won ,
Then our mutual faith we plighted ,
His little eyes till day was breaking ;
Did stars of shrapnel shed their light ? _ --
On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven ;
Made the moon and stars attend me ,
Sung on direct , and threaded every ring .
Turns what was once romantic to burlesque .
The german , grown as brutish as the dane ,
That they have spied on beauty ; what if we
Of mild bright light that gild the trees .
In words like these the foe addressed :
His master 's hand had led .
All round had faded , leaving me alone :
More of his grace than gifts to lend ,
Like snowy clouds the young sheep lay ,
And ought ' a ' caught a higher sense ,
Of midas , which his greedy wish ensued ,
I would wade through seas of blood to know again
It calls to mind that mighty buckingham ,
Behold the man whose dirge all europe sings ,
For having lost but once your prime ,
At which she lifted up her voice and cried .
A little unto laughter moved my lips ;
" to what i feel is lord of all ,
Which force can neither quell nor cage .
The broad stream bore her far away ,
“ thy speech is marked with scorn of truth ,
We measure your gray sea , that never rests ;
Felt pity enter , and sustain 'd her part .
And found he had married
To slumber , though the big tear it renewed ;
Behold , in yon stripped autumn , shivering grey ,
That knighthood on thy shoulder laid ;
Meanwhile the world , ambition , owns thy sway ,
To hide the means it never could intend .
And blanche 's song conviction brought .
The sickness raging through the infected frame .
Over that burst of anguish closed the drear
But knowing how the pulse of men beats high
A gleam of faint , faint hope is born ,
Then he directed to the friar this voice :
And fortune at first is inviting --
And will maintain it through each rising race .
From medicine that would check decay .
A look of glad and guiltless beauty wore ,
Their fury makes an instrument of war .
It takes but little water just to touch
Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes , that stood
All songs of current lands come sounding round me ,
Feels it too late to calm the agonies
Each in its cauld hand held a light :
To waste with wars , with blood to stain
Now , words have woven it into a song
To lift the world ; and thou too shalt ascend
The music spoke for us , and said
And spread a train of nymphs on every shore ;
Beside whose course my wrathful course is set .
A morsel the fox would go far to seek .
If loving it should lead you into war --
Why follows then a heaviness of limbs ,
It comes by night , and sucks my breath ,
The hand of passion lies at rest ;
My coming brought no profit to the sky ,
Subject to her spouse was led ,
With the matchless beauty that guido had drawn ;
To my _ unfolding _ lend a gracious ear .
It threw to grounde and overcaste ,
Receive , and wrap me in eternal rest .
Love takes his way and holds his joy deceitful ,
But oh , despair not of their fate who rise
That like real things my dying heart do greet ,
The sleepy trees are bending o'er the stream ;
Misery , have chased from numbers , --
That sings of sweet francesca 's grace :
And public evil never touch the land ! "
So long as i may break thy nightly rest :
And grows erect , as that comes home .
Or mix in rites that heaven regards with pain ?
Cutting deep and deadly with its edges keen .
In that fierce winter , and the land still ran
So ready is heaven to stoop to him .
Here pilgrims roam , that strayed so far to seek
Had lured to taste the tide it poured ;
And flamed the limitless welkin . terror fell
Or doth he stay the summer-tide ,
And all the grove in wild confusion lay .
( which is n't saying much ) .
Severest of the orders that belong
The single base of virtue built to heaven :
And he went as the best of 'em go ,
Each that draws is a swan or a dove ,
If leaves go by us in a gust ,
Like all whom life turns with a frown
My childhood chanced and chose to be :
Rich melodies are floating in the winds --
That waved the soft and silken hair .
" too late ! " its mournful echo sighed ,
Autumn , of biting blasts , the time of blight
Headlands their hoary watches keep ;
With him , well pleased my days to pass ,
And death must dig the level where these agree .
Shall prayers go up , and hymns be sung
And the god who never changes
Thinking of you has made me suddenly old ,
She in her hostel found ; but small delight
And with a due revenge that wrong repay .
In the new world his all to find .
These drew in turn her chariot , when in state
Like giants seem to guard the dust beneath .
In ruthless ruin scatter 'd lay :
Her martyr breathed his steadfast soul away .
Have reached and pricked her heart , and throwing flat
Which every valley richly bore me !
But sorrow 's sel ' wears past , john ,
For nature teaches how to find the clue .
Sole heir , for secret services , is made :
Though fate had fast bound her
And now the tennis sports went on ,
Throng hissing uncouth love , and his heart warms
To sultry august spreads its charms ,
Making the mystery of nature clear ?
But nature renders it imperfect ever ,
That looking on would make old nestor young .
Till ravening giants seized the prey ?
Filled with food as a favor to men .
Let welkins with your shouts resound !
Till his face wore a satisfied glow ,
Without some gift my love to show .
Fainter and fainter waned the solar ray
And souls went palely up the sky ,
Suddenly set it wide to find a sign ,
On feeling 's scales that trembling sway .
Of eternity , it sought again
The fields bring yearly
Down by his art old archimedes draws .
This dread war shall still proceed --
But still she gave her sorrow vent :
Ardent for fighting ; now he lies at ease
How small , of all that human hearts endure ,
Only comes from my creator ;
Its evening wept with sobbing rain ;
And though the air must rush as fresh
At the resurrection , the old affection will revive .
By high education brought pressure to bear .
All silent now , the choruses are gone ,
The frost of hermit age might warm ;
The music is over , and vanished the wrecks .
Became stone-blind , precedence went in truck ,
Backsliding christians trembling came
In fond embraces , gives her arms to twine ,
Because short time and sweet goes by .
Of the achaian ships some slaughter 'd lay
To push my fortune in the world ,
From under the trees they drew him last :
I took compassion on her , bade her steep
A few revolving months should waft him o'er ,
For youth goes over , the joys that fly ,
None their ambitious wish could smother ,
Capricious fancy may not find in thee ? --
Lo ! solitude floats down the river wan ...
Thick noisome mists were spread .
The ancient woodland lay .
The waters wild went o'er his child ,
Bradamant couched her golden spear again ,
What advantage has our coming into this world produced ?
Led on by hell to take the royal side ;
Snowdrops that plead for pardon
But meat and beer were meant to stay .
Out of experience that made her wise .
In crushing southern slavery potent factor .
Show where the labor lay and where the ease ,
There the mourners lay their burden
Will soon make the young folk old ;
While our feet still cling to the heavy clay .
And ether , fixed high o'er twinkling stars ,
And they were lost forever and for aye .
Again , ere readiest answer found a place ,
Of one i had long held dear .
She rather took than got a fall ,
An instinct within it that reaches and towers ,
To give us more than hope can fix upon .
There where the breasts arise are purple stains ,
And other winds do follow -- the high roar
Out of unwinding mists arise
Where godliness might reign perpetual ,
Feelings , and thoughts , and knowledge came again .
Whose offerings flowed from weeping eyes ,
And here you 'll find that subtle gift ,
Be glad , whatever comes , at least to know
And clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts ,
" they held to be rank blasphemies . "
And all my blood it filled with sharp and sweet
And loving care to us have shown :
And all the city sank down into hell .
Cowards too may give attention ;
The long-neglected son 's debts pay .
While fortune glowed and terror filled the plain ,
To seize a soil which not your labor till 'd
While little joys and cares absorbed my strength .
Winter is passing . the inconstant sun --
A man , set lonely between gain and loss .
From guilty deeds that shame and stain .
So shook his wits they wander in his prime --
Yet strict attention must be given .
A mirror that made the blood run cold .
Why of the heritage no portion came
And level fields ; and curly vines that lay
And where the path in safety leads us down .
Swarmed with enchantment , till his spirit sank ,
Have the best results proceeded ;
A soul resolved would find the means to die .
The birds make glad the forest-trees ?
The stroke of fate the strongest can not shun :
Raged and roared the wintry tempest ,
Gone with their genial airs and melodies ,
And felt her charms , without disguise , within .
Shall , groaning yield the vital breath he gave ,
In costumes of that simpler age they came ,
To bring the mourner comfort ,
A tempest of fierce laughter rolled around
Nor greece , nor carthage ever spread the sail
Where our flag now in glory flies !
Thus having spoke , apollo wing ’d his flight ,
Softly swam the boat that bore our love ,
Or climbed among the images of the past --
Deeply worn , a pathway led :
Whilst ignorance and vice are fed ,
To turn her home to her desired lord .
Where things lie undistinguished , scarcely seen .
Her blue eyes they would wander far away ,
To last , a love set pendulous between
I would have given thee comfort in the work .
The wind it wailed , the wind it moaned ,
And the soul of them rose like a presence ,
The song that makes the dew-mist melt ;
That bring the fog and mist .
Their ostrich stomachs make their swords their meat .
If bliss made gods , a deity ?
The light that shone when hope was born !
If aught my soul would say
The sea takes her image to lie
The rock on which the storm will beat ;
That gives its life for beauty 's sake ,
Truth has a standard openly displayed ,
He heard the cymbals clash amid the crowd
I fumbled at my nerve ,
Then in trembling joy i fled ,
Raised me when my hopes were low ,
Abroad to gentle airs their folds were flung ,
With speaking tail that registers thy mood , --
Thus hath he unto death his beauty given :
As we offered to justice offended
There lay by chance a posted tree thereby ,
His plan succeeded , as i know too well ,
And then the voice of blame found vent ,
That flew on so rapidly , sweet with content ?
There came a hurry of feet and little feet ,
Now turns , and backward bears the yielding bands ;
And her gigantic image reared .
The weary tears fell down apace .
The joy that revell 'd in his breast .
The twain were left ; and misery
Wrought by this pendulum that swings
Who with his fear is put besides his part ,
What there lies hidden ! but the oracle
And finds its ocean round the great white throne .
Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee ;
To quell the rage of literary war !
Like an angel 's wing that beat towards me .
When three of our troop came to trouble ;
Five thousand gold ducats pack up . '
Break forth into praise of god !
Life plucks all the blooming hours
She crown 'd with olive green , came softly sliding
Replenishment might find : and every god
The old commandments stand :
That lay in the house that jack built .
And singing waters roll .
Thy god was making hast into thy roofe ;
As morning dew hangs trembling on the rose ,
With my broadsword filled with fervor ,
Could such a spirit come from mortal womb ?
Before this act came out in print ,
And the same old waves went by ,
There did a thousand memories roll upon him ,
Nor hid the flame that he within him bare .
With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan .
The rumor goes that tom was full of drink ,
( with which i do not stain my tale )
And tears with songs of praise to blend .
There clung three roses to a stem ,
England has toil -- italia happiness ! "
Thy ways admit no blemish ; none i find ;
The crown of empire heavily has set .
On purpose to make prized the life at large --
But found the cobbler singing still ,
Where industry still urges labour 's speed ,
Before me lay a long and lonely track
Thy charms submitted to a mortal love :
Your strength will waste if it is not used ,
We will have beds which exhale odours soft ,
The vision i have tried to catch , --
Only to lead us captives to despair .
Love thou , for it comes from god .
She answer made to all .
When e ' ening steals alang the sky .
Nor drop her work from her doting hold ,
A battle round of squadrons three they show
Of eyes that flitting round alight like birds ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
As autumns came an ' winters went
Look closely . do these tender hues betray ?
Goe tell the church it showes
They have never seen the sunshine , nor the glory
That steadfast , mournful strain , consoled
At cures , in travel , fighting psychic ills ,
Fast silent tears were flowing ,
The precious gift which good damoetas gave ;
There gaja , strong and glorious , led
May heaven 's brightest stars watch over thee !
There is a bank that always gets
Of every hope , whence will it fall ?
Fitted to shake the purpose of the peer ,
He yielded ; and thus side by side were laid
The incense of the hearts that praised and prayed ,
Trot , trot , the baby goes ,
Copper fell from every feather ,
And covered the past with forgiveness .
These it had been your lot to bear ,
Emblem right meet of decency does yield :
In such a mansion , as scarce thought finds words
And death shall join to part no more .
The landlord i found sir adopted one plan ,
Whose very hails new christen death .
That lets not god be manifest to you . "
As any man that set foot on
His thundering sword made all on heaps retire ,
Lxvii - her lips no questions ask ;
To follow : surely , if your highness keep
With all her gifts to reach the light discerned
Let us pursue truth , knowledge , liberty !
From a worthy race descended ;
Copious the blood ran all around the dead .
The rosy glow has faded from the sky ,
No sob crept through to sadden me .
Something that wo n't show the dirt ,
And see the finish of his days . "
Drops of compassion tremble on my eyelids ,
Ring out the grief that saps the mind ,
But issued from the bark with hurried pace ,
Like rival queens that tended arthur , there
And lays to his untroubled soul the balm
And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected ,
He watched her eyes in the heaving sun :
The reckless waves you must plunge into .
Through paris ’ shield the forceful weapon went ,
A flood of glory hangs upon the world ,
A tide of noises flowing out --
Though once i held his memory dear .
Fears for a moment to meet despair ?
But over the roofs there came
Has made it a downy nest . _
The sorriest i ever feel
More beautiful , more wasted by decay ,
The hours of night you pass asleep in bed ;
And beneath the mould made answer :
Without thy faithful roland 's succour found ?
And only dust lay in the cup ;
Now , europe 's feuds distract his brains :
His heart leaped with a glad desire
He led the line that broke the foe .
Scrubbed till it shone , the day to grace ,
Days ' journey full a hundred stretching far away ,
Until the heart is puffed with pride and goes
It passed into thy lifelong regency .
In the brown grasses slanting with the wind ,
And not risk all to get the cheers ;
They push their way through tangled grass and
It serves its purpose passing well .
O yes , the cottage once again i see ,
The shivers greet and the shivers nod .
And executing judgment it executes with ruth .
My spirit hopes in god to set me free
On the pale path that lies below ,
Cloud-like arose the image of desire ,
Meantime the war approaches to the tents ;
That news produced in this orthodox nation ?
And the mother 's heart went wild ,
This makes you feel very lonely .
Iliadic lines taken are in the third person .
Bay does n't stay in the stars any more ;
To plunge the branding terror in his soul .
That other sighs unanswered stole ,
They lay in bed till the clock struck ten ;
There is a city that the cooling fog caresses ,
The walk will find some places still and warm
The glorious poem i found .
When wounds and suffering shall give them power .
Who to this treaty first should yield consent .
The toughness of the web wrought from such strands
This word alone shall fit ;
By turning to a lover ? "
Some touch of happiness appears .
Than a shine lit up the face so shady ,
And he swept away the clouds so gray ,
Fair , laurelled spirits seemed to soar ,
Arysing forth to run her mighty race ,
Answered in the words that follow :
He must lead the tyrant weather ;
Spurred on by want , held in by fear ,
Kindled and quenched , unto the motion coming
But seeing that he 'll know it .
Slow and tired , came the hunters --
The master will find your wits ,
I saw my life 's long-lost desire --
Where imperishable shields and swords were beaten out
January brings the snow ,
But my anger coiled , preparing its fangs .
Meek loveliness is round thee spread ,
It will make thee fair and lovely .
Then , while fates suffer , live thou free
Nor wound nor breach in what he takes .
That with rage my soul is burning .
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn ,
Nature in him was almost lost in art .
Fade away the great traditions ,
Poor pilgrims needs must lose their way ,
Shall add new value to the ravish 'd toy .
The hallowed taper trembling in thy hand ,
Put natural religion to the test
I lift my heart as spring lifts up
For he that flung the broad blue fold
My verse shall speak your praise .
‘ in faith i hold thee three . ’
How white the sun comes through the pane !
That the word was made incarnate
While blooming wreaths around thy temples spread ,
The love i bear my dearie .
As fame reports it , with the gods .
-- mothers of men go on the destined wrack
Which was to make our future life 's delight ;
Thus addressed the stranger-heroes :
Of that affectionate tenderness we own 'd
The turret held a narrow stair ,
In his hand soft leading the martial maiden fair .
To raise sorrow in the scale .
That happy thought has made me cry ,
As though it hung on strong wires , turn 'd
And o 're the dark her silver mantle threw .
Peace charmed the street beneath her feet ,
Lest bogles catch him unawares ;
The house which held this prize ; and , led
That admiration grows as knowledge grows ?
So it comes that we stand lonely
Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie ,
Away , like snow that leaves no mark behind ,
Whose loss makes bitterer than a soundless tear
Thereat new strength they took and courage new ,
To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow :
Who holds in equal scorn dogmas and dreams ,
Darkness hides no dearer head :
Eden and all the coast in prospect lay .
About green moss , about fish that get lost .
Making all the vales rejoice ?
And the heaven of our dreams lies far away .
Drowning in blood him that from blows escapes .
And my heavy burdens lightened . "
And gloom descends upon the forest bowers ;
Now from its soul arose a piteous moan ,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings ;
The moon too brings her world so nigh ,
In the meantime evening crept on :
And made the bar unhasp its hold .
Within his bending sickle 's compass come ;
In lavish streams to quench a country 's thirst ,
I should know what it means --
And when the summer comes again
Not that remorse did not oppose temptation ;
" to reach our marriage bed . "
How beautiful , if sorrow had not made
Weep , nor be with sorrow filled ?
Now he is lifted up , to light are brought
Nor leave one look in all the past
The crowd of following children loitered home ;
What a world of merriment their melody foretells !
If heaven was shocked at such presumptuous wrongs ,
Beneath each banner proud to stand ,
The fountains murmur " let us spray "
As clouds with clouds embrace .
Baal-zephou came riding the air ;
And spring 's fresh voices call ,
Like sun-shot clouds confused , or rent apart
Who followed treason 's banner , or forswore
Down , down goes the great titanic
Harmonious souls by angels set attune --
But as flowers that fade and are grey ,
Let 's turn his old moral to use .
They laid foundations of the mundane school ,
Now entering his great duel , not of arms ,
Now they reach the home of ahti ,
And wrapped in sullen mist and rain ,
When kingdoms fought with rasping breath
That with kindness a heart so corrupted can beat .
Against a host he made a stand ;
As one who with his landlord stands deuce high
To hide the question and dissolve the doubt .
The hostile army just below them lie .
I seemed to stand and listen , while each word
And trace the orbits of the rolling spheres ,
For what has come of love and me
This is the song of the wind as it came
What turns him now a stupid silent dunce ?
When there struck on us a sigh ;
The saint alone his preference retains
Make us _ dream _ of all that followed ?
Hence lakshmaṇ hither comes to break
But no boy knows when he goes to sleep .
Awake , be quenched , ere it can rest .
And spoil the beauty they made live .
To spread his gospel when first introduced ,
And that the sad lament by sorrow bred ,
His breathing makes me faint with fear ,
And he saw a little wonder .
Good , not evil , to thee bringing ;
For if the darkness and corruption leave
And the slim dusk slip out . . .
Even such became i at those proffered words ;
Of those dread tones unspeakable has reached
Masculine souls pass across the mirrors :
And wail upon wail went up to the stars
All my happiness goes out to you .
And flowers themselves , that sway through sunny hours ,
To make more vent for passage of her breath ;
Must furnish more than nature gives .
He soon the silence broke ,
Where state grasps more than plain truth needs ,
All made a magic symphony ; but when
Why wish the fleeting years to stay ? --
Long may you stand , the friendly mark ,
I 've got the ring to wed ,
All between that works or grows ,
The glad lark , soaring heavenward from the sod ,
The glory which our god surrounds ,
Its ships went out to every clime
" to make man deathless as a star ,
His seat , where solitary sports are seen ,
One hideous , cynic , levelling orgy , where
Where the reefs arise from ocean .
But in his race his bow he drew .
They cast their elm and oak trees low :
Except of sighs , that made th ' eternal air
To quarrel and make such a noise !
To all the rules by artists framed ;
Its cameo of the abjured one drew
And give thee all my joys to keep .
As well might whales by closing waves expire ,
Oh , as i lay and wrestled with despair ,
And such joys as these she 'll bring . --
As the nations sat together , grimly waiting --
And the age changed unto a mimic play
Or tender bird to bear another 's fate .
His shade returns again , that was departed . "
Where the river widens to meet the bay ,
All things have come since then to me ,
They have not laughed , and therefore ill goes he
And fairly laid the zodiac in the dust .
The brave days had discovered you ,
And faithful say , to you the powers belong
Perhaps i shall not reach the goal i seek ,
My spirit flew in feathers then ,
And the trees stand gaunt and bare ,
And cling to faith and honor still ;
Nor are you therefore less in reverence held ;
The golden hair that crowns her loveliness ;
Richer , diviner as it flows ;
Sweet stream , that winds through yonder glade ,
And gave me strength to bear again my cross .
Who feels his god so near ,
When sweet airs come seaward
The charm on sleepers laid
The word of the kings to give ?
What wives and wabsters see and feel .
Cast his strong arms about his drooping wife ,
To swell the tide of hours forever gone .
Often ornateness goes with greatness , 39 .
Those lotus eyes reward my pain ,
And creak of engines lifting ponderous bulks ,
When but from pleasure heaved the prophet sigh ,
Pretending that their stone eyes stare --
With crimson pennon fluttering new ;
The seasons went , and still she stood
The lips wax cold that murdered where they kissed ,
" at the poorest love was ever offered :
That hospitality could claim ,
Their end , and reckoned on our broken bonds ,
To find a remedy , put up with pain ,
Before the second town two armies lay ,
And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly .
Who rouseth up all christendom
And after april , when may follows ,
As storm across his soul that kept
To whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm 'd ,
Borne on its perfumed wings the title came :
By some proud foe has struck the blow ,
While all thy restless ways grow full of peace ,
And april put her riot in young bloods ;
The flesh , and poisonous drug employ aright :
Athena left the high mansions of the blest ,
The dim-eyed violets yearned with pain .
Myself i had lost of us twain ,
They burst their manacles and wear the name
I see my love as in a dream --
There for his healing cunning leeches wrought ,
Of purity the will alone gives proof ,
And the pale stars musically set
And elm trees nodding at the stars .
Chaste words proceed still from a bashful mind .
To a giant 's stature soaring and intolerable speed ,
And all round the candle the crooked shadows come ,
Yes , autumn sped away and with it passed
My holy self , thy pure ideal , lies
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared .
The night wind brings , as twenty summers since ,
August brings the sheaves of corn ,
What greater bliss attends their close of life ?
Which asks no monarch , to support the stars :
There comes the memory of a god 's decree
And lovely the lands that ' neath it lie ;
An owl 's was the answer made .
From which the plant of human friendship grows .
He saw that writing 's truth .
A scheme , analogy pronounced so true ;
Down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak ,
When comes the poet 's eye .
Of humble human being , held the ground .
Things that steam can stamp and fold ;
To fit the state wherein that knight was found .
Full many friends we find :
The dear little breeze -- how it wishes to stay
A thousand cannon watched magellan 's straits ,
Do thou drive away thy offspring .
And when she took unto herself a mate ,
And it new come from labours over sea .
The tumult and the shouting dies --
Follow offence . offence , robust of limb ,
Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale ;
And in that compass all the world contains .
Answered in the words that follow :
The sweeter is the wine that flows ;
It blew the stars as clear 's could be ,
To count your blessings often , giving thanks ,
In thee , high heaven above was truest shown ,
As through my cell his glories broke .
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
And o'er the world extend thy wide domain .
From each throat came liquid music ,
Viewed the land and found it fertile ,
Stealthily creeping , the villainous traitor :
From whence or where the indian tribes arose ?
That unto life new energies impart ,
That took so long to get well . "
The best that a land could be giving
Moan of a sad creature strayed ,
Shall he not take comfort and know the truth
Returning absurdly again to the fact that we won ,
The city stands , unstained of sin ;
A host of his murderers dwell in the heart ;
With broken words i made this brief reply :
Glory she only sought for all her pain .
With talents passing most of my compeers ,
And to his mother made reply
That beauty ever can grow old .
And providence have wrought thus quaintly . here
And laughter that sings ?
That have marked your wooing days .
Came furrowing all the orient into gold .
The hearts that gayly beat in pleasure ,
In the breeze that whispers sadly ,
My harp shall tell how from thy cavernous mountain ,
Which cutting off through hasty accidents ,
It throws poetic pearls upon the strand ,
But thither fierce rinaldo threatening went ,
Has kept thee cold since the transcendant noon
Her starry eye lets arrows fly ,
There had the persian 's thousands stood ,
And fought with weakness through long hours alone .
Of dead men they can get no hold .
Whenever i am moved to tears .
The swelling floods of nations rush ,
But oh ! what art can teach ,
And for his aids gave access to the sea .
As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake !
Casting the robe of the soul that you wore
To house the profit that arrives ;
Such frigid fustian could contain ;
To where they held the carnival .
And one bore frankincense that fate foretold ;
Shakes off her ten years ' sorrow . open stand
The flinty heart that canna feel --
Though the wind hath fallen , they drift along ,
And the truth of it came to pass .
Among his clan the wealth they bring ,
The spell , that kiss has laid on me ,
The nazarene who bore
Faith i shall give the answer reynard gave :
Sweetly to shed
Where clouds go over ,
To quench the fire of anguish in some eye
It mocked to scorn my innocence and youth ;
There stood -- but one short league away
These vanishing blossoms -- what are they worth ?
My simple meaning hath abused :
Resembling , straightway in its place arose .
Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds .
The tiresome days rolled round , never relieved
And so 't was useless making more delay .
The ceaseless play of twinkling feet admired .
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
The winter 's rain and summers scorching heat .
In wave by angel stirred and all so bright ,
To heaven , lost in the blending
Her eyes in floods of sorrow drowned ,
Whose shoes made a horrible creaking ;
Loud murmurs fill the skies -- swift vengeance all
Having gained her point , she burst into tears .
Can wrong make right ? "
That northward of the alps my country lies ?
The perfect type is seen in villegas :
By station and bright raiment , gathers heat
The chief she found amidst the ranks of war ,
Revenge on him that made me stop my breath .
To catch our reflection
Slowly the great notes fall and float away : --
Have cast their lives away ? go quickly thou
Each at its port , the grim artillery lay ,
Where love lies bleeding still ;
Of broken fortunes , daily fronted him
Had passed through many a grade with eager haste ,
In rich men 's shelves they take their ease ,
Good children get from the king .
Will yet come short of self-conceit .
Some gloom that hangs about his mournful moods
This word did mahomet say unto me ,
Here comes the wind of the blow !
With sweet juice that in honey lies :
Before the roman arms , led on by thee ,
And the deep tumult thundered through the bogs .
Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill .
Up sprung the spirits of the waves ,
Two men i see , of might invincible ,
And the wooing came to nought .
He felt he as a king had fared ;
And thou shalt see nor pain nor strife ,
-- life , that filling her , passed redundant
All had sunk in the black morass !
Before some light is lent it from on high ;
The radiant image of his glory sat ,
When out of independence sprang
Misenum received its name . ]
In sweet unrest my visions come and go ;
When sinking spirits find no cure
A lifeless , stifling air weighed on the world ;
And cause the sun to borrow light of you .
When the stars are veiled and the moon has sailed
But it meant such desolate years .
That gives us any rest .
Retreated half-aghast , the fierce old man
Take but this poesy that now followeth
It floats at pleasure ,
Which whirling ran around so rapidly ,
To think that nature made thee to express
To give command it should not stand ,
Where blow the winds of memory from the past ,
His thirst and hunger soberly repress ’d .
In angry pride he raised his voice of fear
Sorrow passed , and plucked the golden blossom ;
Ill-omened silence followed his appeal .
The spear-boat general got but little honour :
Each leads ten vessels through the yielding tide .
In musing on the brief play played by them
With music waiting on her steps ,
The footsteps of their fathers tread . ”
Forget thy weakness , upon which is built ,
Such thought , that in it bound
And tears swift flowing , thus he made reply :
Then the blood flows again
I look 'd about , but found myself alone ,
The little stars sat one by one
White faces seemed to peer .
How far does gravitation serve our needs --
Sick to the heart : and sees no end
That 's sinking in despair ;
And formost from the tomb shall bound : }
A sight that hath undone me for this day .
Know where death will surely follow ,
The wind took off with the sunset --
Where i met but the human and sin .
Came a voice of some foul fiend from hell :
The snow sails round him as he sings ,
To conquer troy , with ours thy forces join ,
Fly to the beaujon , and there seek relief
Freewill restores the father to the skies ,
Would soon give place to rueful cries
Till twiston went , the war still seemed
Spring claims our tender , grateful , gay delight ;
Halts and looks backward and draws breath
Meantime all forward drew : me terror seiz 'd
Of former joy , we come to kindle new .
Through thee to man is easier made :
Till it comes to using little human stings .
Which the moat covers , where is paid the fee
There came to me in dreams a stammering woman ,
Shifting her side , short respite seeks from pain .
For in her hope lay his !
His spirit takes , unconscious of a chain ;
To keener joy or suffering they are stirred .
- that i will not show zeal again to learn
My beauty , which the loftier it climbs ,
And makes all within me rejoice ;
Were hepsy higgins inclined to mate ,
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
What art has constructed with patience and toil ,
With his name bid the infamous treaty appear ,
See the solemn night appear ,
And there new islands and new worlds emerge --
Though woes surround them , reft of all .
Yester-night the sun went hence ,
Fills all the frosty air ,
Now lifts us high , now bids us fall ,
And my heart has gone aboard her
There come a hush and no one break it ,
O , which show 'd greater folly ,
That tells of greatest peril , greatest pain . "
There she lies in queenly beauty ,
And this vain pity never felt before ,
“ nature to all unsparing gives to take ,
E'en as they were , and utter silence fell
For what your candid eye may find in me
Ah , days of joy that followed ! all alone
I 'll leave these sighs and tears a legacy
When british squadrons held the sway ,
When gentler strains demand thy graceful song ,
Drive away these fell diseases ,
He sought the absolution of the pope .
May come upon the followers of the light , --
Nigh came the wondrous multitude .
Were abelard 's departed passions caught
Ten days we 've floated fearfully ,
Full three days were not sped ,
Within the moral system lies
Found these songs so wild and wayward ,
From whence its life is given --
And over it gorgeous curtains fell
Eyes that seemed to ask a question ,
That pure religion never aught subtracts
Hills of promise gleaming bright ,
I can not yield assent to this
Found his struggles at an end ,
A petal falls from the dreamland rose .
The clouds blow heavy towards the moon .
She felt dark pleasure with her frenzy blend ,
Moath arose in alarm ,
And as he spoke a wondrous light was shed
All night he fought for air :
Try , if the grave can hold the wanderer ;
The snowy flowers shuddered and grew still
When the warm tides of love come surging back .
From royal seed his mother 's race was sprung ,
Where sweeping views stretched wide on every hand ,
This move in heavenly wisdom made ,
Their distant laughter comes upon the wind ,
Words bright and kind as grace might make
One cloud of beauty sweeping the wild sea ;
As mighty thoughts run rampant through his head .
To these i made no scruple to reveal .
A mighty squadron through the gateway flows .
And indignation make thine eyes o'erflow ,
Not far that stood from the monarch ’s knee :
Of love an ignorant man i reckon .
Which , rushing upward from a hero 's heart ,
Which he within me dictates , singing go . "
Which could alone from love at any time proceed .
To raise in air unto the shores of light
Her shape arises ,
Themselves but shadows , into shadows go ;
To make the old amends ,
The pain she wish 'd to share .
Wiped his bright eyes , his grief subdued ,
And mingle in the mirth they made ;
Silver sun , whom god has fashioned ,
From the hand of hypocrisy and quenching the fire
Of chilliest hearts , and all is lost :
True love , and which thereafter grows by loving ,
And over the leagues that rolled between ,
To lower sails and gather in the lines ;
May take your incense like a gracious god ,
Wearie to see the heavens still wavering thus ,
The fires that blast and burn ;
The tempest roared with rushing rain ! ...
Their feverish thirst allay , and smile revived .
“ now , monarch , ere the hosts proceed ,
But hands perfidious strung the ambush bow ,
About gabrina 's neck a halter threw ,
To a tarry torch applied it .
And bravely they fare
Of thinnest texture flows the silken veil :
The lords of chios into exile went .
The second edition corrected :
Our hearts lie buried in the dust
Rise again for home and freedom ! set the battle
The courier gave the fort a warning blast ;
Of secrets yet to explore .
To cast dishonour on a god by birth
And dark and silent the water lies ;
In one thy oneness us together bind ;
That first arrive , in peace their quarters take .
A glimmering light that shines afar
Leave thee naked to laughter ,
Gerenian nestor issued forth , and sat
The sunlight fell in glory on her hair ....
Ring , telephones , and cut the web !
Wide as the love of christ that opened them .
And the pale spectres trembled at her view :
The tide of civil passion rose and fell .
Their vanish 'd hopes of victory renew ;
Of the providence waiting unsought .
Not a spar that comes to grief !
Who moves -- what stirs in the startled air ?
While moon goes west and sun comes east .
And by complaining make his griefs appear ,
We must leave it now to fate .
Which egotism has brought them to think
I see their sad tears falling ,
The monarch held his peace when this was said ,
Thy hero son a hero met ;
The breath of night hung in the soundless air .
They would have made you like a pageant , bold
The showers beat
Blind me with burning tears , but look beyond
And he spoke the words which follow :
And they gave him greeting loud :
It 's own reward our gallant action brought ;
And whose venom comes from hisi ,
And gentle hearts with humble suits are moved :
The american spirit speaks :
I saw what still my heart is shaken by :
Round and round the seasons go :
And , looking to god who ordained divorce
He takes his chirping , and cracks his jokes .
The ripe grass waving on the hill :
And turn to the manifold teachings
And only give one little grunt and die ;
But no power to seek or shun ,
And wicked men sought thy undoing ,
By their own fears made bold ,
And find the mystery opened with the key ,
But yonder aslant comes the silvery rain ,
As thought on rapid thought advancing ,
As each stream still prises ,
To arrest the fleeting images that fill
Must lend its aid to illustrate all their charms ,
For in my heart i bear it
Whatever light man finds they doubt it ,
" what farther subterfuge can turnus find ?
He gained a world ; he gave that world
When dying may bears june , too young to know
Guiltless of blood , withdrew .
Ever , so hath my soul enclosed thee round
Placed here thy torch more beauty would display ,
Of the heaven that within her she feels .
The eastern shores see faint tides fade away ,
Their accents did resound .
Thy kindred appellation comes , and who ,
Hath seen its purity ,
His goodly spirit should move forth , returning
He grabbed the receiver -- his face wore a frown
And luck may turn , and mine be mended ,
In southern skies content to hold his course ;
To gain that sweet nirvana each one tries ,
Because the glass had cut his hand .
Yet who can read his fate !
Though hearts reach back and memories ache ,
And that stands all awry .
And those grim words no years had worn away .
Lovers find sleep , nor dream of love again .
That held the portals of her speech ;
Flowers , sweet be the breath you shed :
To reach perception of the utmost soul ,
With every virtue crowned .
Character of the eclogues indicated by expressions
How knightly seems the iron image , shown
Each , musing , carries it to bed ,
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
Practical purposes served by stories of trade and commerce .
That immortal dream when el dorado flushed the skies !
He went before king edward straight ,
Heart of the world give heed ,
The humble stone shall tell the tale
With all its deep and swelling tide sincere ,
His nobles round him their station kept :
And the sheen extended further ,
While space illimitable stretched before .
And he dropped his line of cedar
Its pages scintillate with wit ;
Those calls came fast and faster ,
As if this rapture all were made for me .
And his heart shook with feverish fright .
With slanting eyes you would say were blind --
Of the ladies who on this occasion took part ,
When speech run free as the songs of birds
I made a wish before the star
He fills all utterance with love .
And all the love she had to spare
Has left its frightful scar upon my soul .
The sails at noon left off their tune ,
The land is laid in snow .
The burial office read ,
Nought can i find to compare with love :
And the deep-rooted base of empire laid .
To swell the tide of hours forever gone .
The sacred fillet of his god he bore ,
The exhalation of her soul that caught
If merely warmth of feelings urged me here ,
Something dear to the lips that so warmly caress
And as it fell him forto tarie
Behind low boughs the trees let down outside ;
And all our little tumults set to right ;
Clear comes each feature ;
Those oaths which sworn to good rinaldo were ,
Olivier feels that he is hurt to death .
It points to the high and sublime ;
Kaikeyí is the fire that feeds
Within the crystal , which records the name ,
And whilst the english eagerly pursue
White as the changing walls of faerie ,
What holds me , that i deal not now
Making me gentle by your willingness .
By passion ruled and born to woe ,
Traveling on foot , went forth in haste ,
But in my speech was naught could give affront ;
Such mighty wonders as the spheres which go
Pale pallas swept with shrill and steely clank ,
The silver shaft of sunlight where it goes ,
And death must dig the level where these agree .
And filled my life with love affairs ,
And the whole mystery made known .
Like the dwarfs of times gone by ,
Has made the herbage grow ,
The lamps go dotting , row on row ,
And all the virgins bear their part ,
With joy they heard the breathing winds arise ;
A thicket hung with masks of mockery
What holds thy courage from so brave a field ?
The love i sought , the great reality , "
Gray as the sky my path before me leads .
The world 's amendment flows ;
He cast it down into that deep abyss .
Hardly suffice to rampart grief .
Meanwhile the others went on getting dinner ready about the
Fate would not let me follow where he led .
He said , and them left pacing slow along ,
In slumber sweet the reverend phoenix lay .
That opened to them , she awhile did wait ,
In whose love , though hope may dwindle ,
The wires shall murmur through the main
And , tho ' the charm still lingered on ,
The occasion of his embassy displayed :
You gave your beauty for an hour ,
And show no fortitude , but in the field ;
He saw the gardens near the town that lay ,
" come conquer me and take thy toll . "
Has given that wand and furious name to bear ;
Or draw the troops within the walls of troy .
Then arose the notes of discord ;
All hours came laden with their own delights
Thou shalt in respect be held
There is no wind to stir the leaves ,
His faulchion he in deadly combat drew .
Those scarlet judges , threatening bloody pain !
And streams their rippling currents rolled
Urged me , unwilling , this attempt to make ;
That grief hath shaken into frost . "
Impossible is held ; as argument
In which all good and evill was enclosed ,
Her life , made holy and serene
When the tapers now burn blue ,
Of the gentle christ who bringeth peace and
May hang upon each wasted breath .
Then might i pass her sunny face ,
My steps turned ever to the hidden shrine ;
And wondered how she bore her fate .
With his twilights dashed with rose
But opposite in leveld west was set
They set the tall reeds swinging ,
Horrible are the huge entrails which the morrigan washes .
Do people stand at attention to mourn a hero
To smooth the ice , or add another hue
And raise above their dust that all may know
Their jubilant music forever ringing .
O'er the stars that forever move on ,
A shadow seems to pass .
Instead of running away and joining the army .
Still to my view in dismal colours rise --
What marvel if each went to wrack ?
And all the far-off past reveal .
Which , though follow 'd forever , forever doth seem
Is more than my heart can give .
Seen the rosy wine that flows there ?
When the bright sun had left the skies
I might endure his curse . my pen has stabbed
The songs that it sings are sobs .
As it roared along the forest ,
Longs for a son to settle his estate ,
And ariel weeping from belinda flew ,
Of rapturous exultation , swelling high ;
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran ,
Those high sweet accents mounting in the hymn
Of faith , on battling waves i float , pursued
Let ithers dream an ' sigh for wealth ,
His beating bosom claim ’d the promised fight .
That leaves the rainy fragrance musical .
At thy blythe carol clears his furrow 'd brow .
From whom all other argives shrank in fear .
Are mortals urged through sacred lust of praise !
And through it there pulsed an angelic voice :
Like tress they stand whom god has given ,
Shall come dishonor 's stain .
Suns and their bright broods swim .
Old winter comes on with a frown ;
What other thoughts and events may arise ,
And with loud curses leave the mystic shade .
What shape so furtive steals along the dim
A sight than gave one ; as if subtly she
To fit me for the years that lie ahead .
' and what of spirits flown ,
Imperial wonders raised on nations spoiled ,
Than lose the blessed hope of truth .
The insulted mind he sought to quench , and blend
And make this darkness gay ,
To question , nor myself could aught discern ,
While nymphs take treats , or assignations give ,
What fate a wretched fugitive attends ,
For from those eyes the madness came .
' a soul has gone to god , '
How perfectly her life was framed ;
With goddess-like demeanour forth she went ;
They all gave way before my wrath ,
In mingling concert with the rural sounds ;
Wild nature 's vigour working at the root .
When any one it makes to thirst for it .
Along the shining path of love ?
Nor make appeal when death comes on .
And before thee there goeth a phantom beseeching
Comes sudden to my soul ; and i must bear
But the harp , again , the minstrel took ;
Himself who gave , with insult takes away .
Screaming , the dissipated rabble fled ;
Dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire ,
The bonds of blood hold longer ,
Your gay visions are flown .
The grief away that stops his answer so :
That makes a new republic one . "
Pray take these principles to heart ,
With that winstanley went his way ,
The hopes that made this bosom swell
On the flying heels of june .
Truth bends abashed , and answers not .
I felt -- but can not paint his rage .
And blessed the silence that she wished were broke .
Now the old homestead is gone to rack ,
Resting not , beating down all the old traces ,
Star be held .
She shall run upon your errands ,
Nor thunderbolts of angry heaven were cast .
But natural necessity begot .
While one on avalanche did chase .
In days of wealthy peace ! but now i see
Dreams of the plans we made , that sleep
O proudest heart that broke for misery !
That his hand was stretched to seize him ,
Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead ,
One spring brought me my wedding day ,
Come wealth or want , come good or ill ,
So weak he hardly can himself sustain .
He sought renown , and found his subjects yield
That made all our moods to rhyme ,
Their mean , apostate worship poured ,
Saw his fierce eye-balls flashing red ,
And then , there came a breath , a breath
A greater sin comes forth , i mean the sin
That less is felt than seen .
The very name of that young life that died ,
In life a little pleasure may be won ,
Recalled her beauty , and resumed her joy .
Child of mine you fill me with anguish ,
The seasons will return ,
Once more towards them the tide of battle swept ;
Finding in pleasure all the good which is ,
By wavering tints which played beneath the star ,
' to him heaven opens a portal ,
All that life gives and the years let go ,
Into the lit circle which called and drew
Taking good care of the baby ,
Vengeance had burned your image on my mind ,
Once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee ;
This , in its larger part they find as clear
January brings the snow ,
Unwearied as they roll ;
Their lasting loyalty to their lord to show ,
And now she must brave the chill night air .
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill .
And for the bliss ye brought me then ,
And heard those shields on iron helmets beat ,
Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang .
This vehement voice came from the northern aisle
Fire in every vein is coursing .
That the clouds may drop their honey ,
That moved the rivulet of your life ,
He which regards the clouds shall hardly reap .
Little sorrows sit and weep .
Like the eyes of wolves glared at them !
The wind at tourney comes and goes ,
She lifted up her voice and cried :
Farewell , fair day , so foully spent !
And , if their minds be friendly found ,
The past is passing , and the present seems
The deep new ages come with her ,
Away the tear that rises here ;
False calves to make me more commanding .
His country 's welfare he keeps full in view .
To the churchyard to take a walk ;
That crowned with tufted trees and springing corn ,
And my heart stood still .
Whose day of glory never yet found night .
And seeks to serve the cosmic soul . i think
When our hearts took their place at the wedding ;
To-day one bed shall hold you both .
Olivier feels the agony of death ;
Most needed . men who seek for fate abroad
On seas that gently rose and fell ,
To lower sails and gather in the lines ;
Or view the couch where sickness lies ;
And whirls of foliage not yet laid , there drove
For punishment comes , and oft comes to stay .
I leave the saints to settle their own score .
And in thy glories more serenely shine ;
It shames the constancy that fled
The hand that held the steel :
Though hid in gray ,
Whose memory so lives in thy bosom . ”
Nor saves them trembling on their timid knees ,
So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith :
Thus hath he unto death his beauty given :
To carry the tale of his wrong
And following the flutter of a song
A comfort sad it brings to see
And your head by doom stricken off at last .
When thorkill held , on easter-eve ,
With love and pity he all over burned .
Comforting tears that fell uncomforted ,
The music that makes mirth above ;
Five powers combine for art 's successful course :
And spread their commerce to remotest lands ,
The mellow sounds that cliff and island gave ,
And all the honour that lay to my hand
Her own but served to set off every joke ,
Shall hold dominion o'er the prostrate world ,
Would be put in immortal rhyme .
Nor spread arachne o'er her curious loom .
Already the slim crocus stirs the snow ,
Like varying winds , by other passions tossed ,
To track shy truth ; her facile wit
It called on all to gather
Love to adore made one with man and beast .
And lower destruction on the hostile tread .
Then the neatherd made answer , saying :
Lost was the day they should have kept ,
Easily gathered either guilt . she sent
So when ten thousand years have run
Before the sinking tide rose with bright waves
Ev 'n the tears they shed alone
" we saw from new , uprising states
" your glance sends fragrance sweeter than the lily ,
Of death , and many are the ways that lead
The man who feels the value of his soul ,
With gathering haze , for now it neared midday ;
Perfumes his progress , pleasures fill his eyes ,
He stifled the poetic flame ;
Or ever thou didst follow christ and paul .
That in the scale eternal justice bears
Drums make merry music when
Till on the pile the gather ’d tempest falls .
Lingering over each tint and dye .
Where swords sow seeds for pale death to reap ,
That she assoil me of my blemishment .
Great profit shall he bring to grecian arms ,
Whose portal wide gave welcome . upward flies
For about me stood that chamber of pain
On thy breath their fragrance borne .
Balin the stillness of a minute broke
And all the hymns that rolled along the vaults
Sweet sleep , that makes more short the night .
Unto her heart there came a dreadful thrill
That crouches over against us . cadiz holds
The hand of death , and your dear daughter laid
And in the lips that gave such power
For when from the loins arose a muffled sound ,
Lo , the journey turned to fairyland ,
" were the world to christianity converted , "
Each one to make his melody .
The heart ; a mouth whose passionate forms imply
It touched the love that moves the stars ,
But presently you feel that you will die
The sea like crystal lay ,
Bradamant made the worthless traitor bleed ;
The shock he firmly stood .
These burning words , her languid head
And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills
My forests packed full of mysterious gloom ,
Few authors tread the paths they recommend ,
Past doubt her wisdom , taking from mad war
As the mountain lark that o'er him sings ,
Fled from the magic of the enchanting shore ,
Is seriously considering proposals which have been made to her
For birth but wakes the universal mind
The vision passed : the ghosts were fled :
Its accent with the thunder strive ;
Eyes that shine with love aglow ,
And desire through him ran --
Dead , she drifteth to his feet .
Sly beelzebub took all occasions
The sorcerer laid his hand ,
He slithered nearer , wet in dewdrops cool ,
To stand the shock of clare 's dragoons .
Did they not turn our triumphs to retreats ,
Remounted my conductor and drew me .
Thus gave the king command anew :
This speaks the glory of the british queen ,
With friends , miles off , held pleasant chats ,
Is wafted the fragrance they shed .
Branches they bore of that enchanted stem ,
Thus the islander made answer ,
And each took its own proper station ,
For the stern pass that draws it to itself .
Her heart a child 's rights to him gave ;
Thy passion for a god to atoms crush thee !
Depart i must : what horrors strike my eyes !
Now mounting the gay seat , the silken reins
Defiant , like great waves surging against each other .
The sands flash 'd back like fields of snow ,
I saw at once that she was charming .
I have found earth 's love but a fetter
Its mighty mystic stream has rolled ;
On each majestic form they cast a view ,
Good fortune worked no change in brown ,
Till the breeze fell off at night .
Which makes them show like roses under lawn :
That came , nor motions to depart !
The melancholy bráhmans passed ,
But from such rivalry it takes a soil .
His echoed laugh replied ,
And may all bliss thy steps attend .
The eagle will eagerly join in the fray ,
Their shout made glad the day .
The music of the seasons touched the strain ,
Dressed in black , the room now entered ;
The steps of autumn echo on the hill .
But i follow the women wherever they call ,
Around their palaces reform the land
This contract is made without consideration ,
The spot was made by nature for herself :
No voice ; but oh ! the silence sank
Upon the threshold holds the earliest stars .
And the spurs bit deep and the whipcord sang
Through the long years her icy vigil kept .
That plunged therein to peace ,
Listen to catch the sadness musical ;
The panting chase at last had turned to bay .
And where my country 's flag is flowing ,
Those two children scooted to frolic and play .
For silence and for sighs that fall
Waging fierce fight in close and straightened place :
From heaven it cometh ,
To roland in return the bracelet gave :
Forth my sins should fare ,
Britain , stand fast !
The soul has closed in deadly fight
I will bless it till it shine .
Of parts harmonious ? give thy fancy scope ,
The whole long street with colour fills ,
Courage came to you with your boyhood 's grace
That ran to the cave 's mouth .
To clear those junkers out of parliament .
And reckless shout resounded . it passed o'er
He too had sunk to death ’s eternal shade ;
His hall rose ' mid the trees ;
Since king marsile makes offer to become
Red grew his eyes , his fierce lips swelled .
Each like a dove leaving its olive perch ,
Across the shoulders came the feather 'd wound ;
Lest lines should grow tangled through fraud or haste .
A silver talent bids them bear away .
What makes that ship drive on so fast ?
The love of thee makes labor light .
The broken billows , shivered into sleet .
Like summer tempest came her tears ,
My song but echoes what great nature speaks .
Here where the snow comes whitely down ,
The joys that may return no more ;
To close with all that makes him happy here .
Flashed on the glory , shone and cried ,
Whose genial warmth revives the flowers .
Cast to the billows . rather had i died
Shall dwindle , shall blend ,
When the sharpest flint made the deepest dint ,
The mistletoe was swinging .
Here , even here , these things remain .
And turned her eyes unto the rippling seine
This bears his missives of life and death
As making small account of any one ,
And wrap in flames our modern troy !
That better time , for which the patriots yearn ,
That no defeat can drive me from the nine .
Preluded those melodious bursts that fill
Make haste to bring your wares to light ! "
And the sunshine gave it softness ,
Whose hand shall serve , whose pen shall draw ,
But all of the things that belong to the day
Love triumphantly has entered !
In opening prospects of ideal joy ,
But when hearts are young , sleep lingers long ,
To a magic of numbers flying before your thought
The council chiefs stem madd ' ning mutiny ;
The cautious elder would not bear away
Her marriageable arms , and with him brings
To push through nights and days with hugest toil
Of treason there make lawless parliament .
That song that came like blessing to the ear .
What is the issue ? let us see !
But to go on to greater height
Until at last her house of pride stands bare ?
We 've reached the silver age ;
The dead leaves fell like brownish notes
But isabel was glad when sunday came
Till i come to give ye freedom ,
Several attempts have been made to maintain magazines and reviews
I could not draw my eyes from theirs
Subjection let us cast away ,
Soon will the high midsummer pomps come on ,
I have come nearer to thy greater worth ,
Making the radiance of the west grow dim .
As falls the sunset 's crimson
Then drew piræus nigh , leading his guest
And now and again its wings went flap ,
So heavy the letter it grew .
't was open field and running flood --
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
All this toil and traffic tend ,
And stars unnumbered trembling beams bestow ;
They sit possessors of his throne .
Of that divinity which rules my heart !
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
A famous hand gives each his fatal hour ;
The hills move lightly and the mountains smoke ,
To keep the mighty oath i swore .
Of golden warp shall shoot it through and through ,
For prudence led the way ;
I see democracy — an ardent band
Nor held himself from fault exempt .
And thy teeth be seized with longing ,
Will bring enough of sorrow . "
It will ride the waves in beauty ,
Sang innocent , and spent its force in air .
That led to peace in love 's sweet atmosphere :
But i have never stood at fortune 's beck :
Of a reason left single to sob !
In danger , thus his counsel gave :
The greeks expect the shock , the clamours rise
" this stair to the altar leads !
The thorns , while they do zing their zong
Puts to rest the wisdom-hero ,
She might descend to hell , or how should find
But of our being in it gave full faith
What lies concealed ; and handsome , manly eyes
To show that one heart was loyal yet .
Or deal destruction on the lycian host .
Surely he is waiting till my steps come nigh ;
And her sole laws religiously obey .
Where'er the passing current drifted ;
To sit and cast my careless looks
And sad the star of evening sank from sight ,
I loafe and invite my soul ,
Curious would mark the death-spot . still upright
Assail it , but those talons hold in dread ,
To think those happy days are gone
When our two souls stand up erect and strong ,
Of eyes that longed for english gardens
And talk of coming sorrow ,
So suited to a slave-cursed land ,
Panther saw an evil spirit ,
" though years have passed since i a fee
And set in gold like that which shines
Pure , ere the world had found them .
What then might come of silent misery ,
And when the cloud of steam had curled to meet
And there october passes
“ thy words that tempt to bliss are fair ,
All , all the days i gain in life .
The only fault my husband found with me --
Aft may i meet the morning dew ,
So from the first , eternal order ran ,
When poverty or sorrow asks his aid ,
The loathing lamb with horror hears ,
Now round us spreads the watery plain --
Who flies the approaching robber to arrest ,
Although his sire apollo gave the song ;
And a word that shall echo forevermore !
Her pity dropped for you
I thought i plunged into that dire abyss
He , from his face removing the gross air ,
They made to press that loveless marriage on ;
So comes this that saw expire
These two months passed
To keep me happy all the day .
Saw that truth had gained her right .
Jealous of the applause they gave him ,
One glory of many glories lighten upon rome .
Answered in the words which follow :
Religion here no gloomy garb assumes ,
And they went on playing the game as before
Love turned to tears , and tears to fire ,
Another chorus now succeeds ,
Whose eye they fill with tears of holy joy ,
But mating is troubled with a far higher meaning --
Then from his eye red flames of fury flashed .
And the black-robe chief made answer ,
On us the shame will fall ,
The lunar horns , and yellow wheat them bound
If you ever shed a tear ,
We waste half our strength in a useless regretting ;
At prices ranging somewhere near
Looking recumbent how love 's column rose
There is no law to hold
He took to praising george the third :
In playing tricks with nature , giving laws
As letters some hand hath invisibly traced ,
The old element whence life arose ,
Filled with anger , spake as follows :
Born sadly on the wind 's taint whispering breath .
To whom the god who gives the golden day :
I pursued the steps of fate .
Left to mankind a legacy of all
Lovers to the woods that go !
I saw her eat my heart .
Yet not wrapped about with awful mystery ,
But wish 'd and sought an end ;
With trembling fear make all the christians flee ,
Of crackling laurel , which foresounds
Every thing holds a slender guiding clue
The bravest , and the victory takes with ease
Old homer in his time made a great feast ,
And laughing flipped it in the air ;
Riding the sea , making the waves give place
Then ráma turned him to retrace
Rather , than wisdom give no welcoming ray .
Such symptoms dire attend them ,
It gave a scant supply ,
Calm peace may meet him on the twilight lawn ;
Of pluralists , obesely lowering ,
The sorrow of them both alike merge now
From violet-banks the scent-clouds float away
And makes thee joyous ' gainst thy will .
Sorrow no lasting trace impress 'd ;
The figure which the spirit lost , its skin
To tread the dreadful way of human birth ,
But life stood still with uncovered head ,
Make small resistance to such warriors ' arms .
Their grim power growing , until the greatest part
Then all my life bid me be slave , --
Where but a look the healing balm had brought .
Black vapors climb aloft , and cloud the day .
The dull , flat falsehood serves for policy ;
Let the clouds distil with honey ,
As far as even memory sees .
So could i bury with me my disgrace ,
Make haste ! bring money while ye may ! '
Fell famine marks the maddening throng .
Where my forsaken course retraced shall be .
What pedigree their horses show .
So that vile monster lay upon the border ,
And folly with the tongue of wisdom speaks .
Making thy waves a blessing as they flow
They climbed the shoulder , and meet enough they deemed
War shall claim command of all ,
To clear a passage through the cruel horde . "
I see he figures as an englishman . "
In speechless faith , there shines a wondrous light
My hungry heart here seeks its bliss ;
Where death sat down a guest ;
Salve gives the witches strength to rise ;
If we have lost our hold on god ,
The boredom of our life ; it took her off
Even as out of paradise was driven ,
That make us ponder while we praise ?
So strength first made a way ;
Enlightened , and their languished hope revived .
Go on , to flourish while thy paintings fade .
Of golden warp shall shoot it through and through ,
Who counts his crimes like gold . --
And thus with grateful words addressed :
Or where keen frost that never yields to spring
That thus from life can death distill .
Just as god leads i onward go ,
And upon him some charge of robbery lay :
Search out and shape the will of god
The substance of my dreams took fire .
But gracefully it stands --
My heart seemed full as it could hold , --
What roman strength turbia showed
Chains may subdue the feeble spirit , but thee ,
Soon wilt find rest .
Each laboured breath with anguish from the lungs
To thank you for the kindness shown .
Now to the low leaves they cling ,
Had sharpened her own deceit ;
To freshen the cheeks which love made pale ;
What rests , but that the mortal sentence pass
Choice should fall on one of worth .
Than the one which once embraced me ,
And back again come the vanished hours ,
That nature hung in heaven , and filled their lamps
Let the dream go !!
He counts his small accomplishment .
The obscure can raise . from this man fortune steals
Divine , the awful deity retired .
Fly coupled , such his vengeance and his ire .
What could it mean ? from out their lethargy
He 'd venture the gallows for siller ,
To make which marriage first was made ?
Into one channel led he all her streams ,
The fire falls asunder , all is changed ,
Or do thy waves make lullaby ,
And gone to seek its heavenly home .
Moved by considerations sordid ,
Then from the altar back a space he drew ,
The trees , now bending forward , slowly shake
But when the bitter hour is gone ,
And mangled bore away the sinewy part .
They missed the songs she used to sing --
Now , when her temperance forms her sole excess ;
She sank into more hopeless depths of sin ,
Turn 'd mean deserters in the needful hour .
Were fixed , the victims of his cruelty .
But he felt quite determined to find it .
Meantime his love maintains my life
Whose scorn and hatred hence derive new force .
Or when her mordant laughter shook the woods .
Surrender , yield the weight of thy great ghost ,
As now might render their long suffering less :
Because the thought of avallon still clings
His rank among the bráhmans won .
Throughout his mind wild thoughts and fearful ran ,
Nor reach his dying hand -- nor dead , --
Death could not make ungentle . i hold rule
I have no cash , i lie in pawn ,
Upon her cheeks her former beauties spread ;
This pig went to market .
Then breezes blew a boon to men --
Where is the work that he wrought with his
Thus her discourse directed afterwards :
To hold and sway the hearts of men ;
There , woodman , let it stand ,
It mattered little whence it came ,
Belial , the dissolutest spirit that fell ,
Relate what armies sought the trojan land ,
Still rang the heavenly music ’s sound
Pure as it came from jesus the lord .
The worker shall have gone unto my rest ,
There comes a laughter in which jests break up
And death makes night of day . ”
That gazed back at me so gay and glorified ,
One of those flowers , whom plaintive lay
Draws out faint echoes of the voice divine
With holy hymns and soaring liturgies :
From the south-east came the whirlwind ,
Of palmed praying hands that meet and yearn --
Which opened up perdition .
Nor can bear their hatred longer ,
Filling all the stores and garners
A wondrous hagring now the heavens covers .
From what dim memories yet may chance to cling
His eager mind reached for it and took hold .
Sound sings in colours , colours shine in sounds :
Then rose from sleep the stalwart argive men
That destruction may o'ertake him ,
Faded and left me lonely in the wood ,
The victory won .
A whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side
Heart of the world give heed !
Was summon 'd to discharge the forfeiture ,
Eyeing the ticking clock the household sat .
Up sprang a sparkling fountain , silver-voiced ,
Some wilder pulse of nature led astray
While still in deepest shade the village lay .
The crashing darkness fell ; our painful breath
And loosed the joints of many a warrior bold .
That stirs in my heart and speaks to me
And men 's souls shot up out of reach
The alarms shout
Truth shall lead thee to the gate ,
Inside , and follows on the following foe .
No wonder then men to such pleasures must yield .
Rinaldo comes to venge the secret treason .
Dauntless he waits , collected in his might ,
The elder ladies ' wrinkles curl 'd much crisper
But hope inspired by faith will guide to heaven !
Hearts to break but nane to sell ,
And vanity stand shrined and deified ,
But burning traces of some ill-starred dream ;
And oft the question will arise ,
And deep as words can follow feeling .
For something hidden , something owed .
These strains the way for thine own strains prepare ;
Venture to make entry on burgundian land ,
Brought peace on earth and drew earth nearer heaven .
And at noon is lost in the sand
Thy thoughts belong to heaven and thee :
Whence arose her brain of evil ?
O ye , to whom the sweetest lays belong ,
From the river winding clearly ,
And death shall seize on the sinner 's soul ;
The breast thrust out in pride
Filled with dreams .
To it a happy name is given ;
This grisly form shalt still retain . ”
Upon all parts , a freezing fear goes through
A troubled look came into her face .
" those virtuous eyes for ever turned on me ;
Burning with gems , attracted her to gaze .
And coupled thereto rigours of fierce wrath !
No daylight trembling on the dungeon bar ;
Of battle , when it raged , in all assaults
The sun strikes down with a blinding glare ,
But not the homage that my lips would pay ?
That told the wedded one her peace was flown .
Where the leaves are broad and the thicket hides ,
She dared to stand on disappointment 's verge ,
Grown affections easily change ;
His flying steeds in safety bore away .
With quickest haste that she can make ,
The melancholy reeds whisper together
The whole creation 's rolled before us .
Legends that ran from mouth to mouth
Drawn back from dust and ruin of the years ,
Passion brings reason -- who can pacify
Because the clergy take the thing in hand ;
That of necessity my sleep was broken .
While the sign of battle flew
And she who walks where duty leads ,
Then ráma , when the cottage stood
Where establishment means nothing
Plucked off the crown his maker gave ,
So knowledge come , no matter how it comes !
And a light wind arose and blew these off ,
Consul and tribune break the laws alike :
Whose charming horrors thrill the trembling soul ;
The land was made resplendent with his train ,
Steel them with judgment , darken them with blame ;
All these years have sought to honor ,
" ye men that frame the public laws ? --
Earth 's stage forever hurries .
But they always shrank away from her
An awful funny one i sorta caught --
Which grew in paradise , the bait of eve
Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears ;
And turn to a lover
The hope that owns a mortal trust ,
The goods committed into fortune 's hands ,
And life feels clean and new ,
And found that , bound on a similar quest ,
A sudden wind rose ; like a runaway horse
To meet the sea .
And their eyes he plunged in slumber ,
The sultry sun lies smouldering .
Albeit he has cast off mortality ,
Hath laid her babe to rest ;
With all the woe that prison may me give ,
Alone it stands in poesy 's fair land ,
When measured by the debt of gratitude
Of a lost race , thou sayest has remained
It is enough to drive me to despair !
Who bears a nation in a single man ?
Fierce waxed the fight and fiercer yet ,
Reason , they say , belongs to man ,
With eloquence , that agonies inspire ,
This precipice had not yet fallen down .
To minos down he bore me , and the judge
My bridal gifts shall load the future spouse :
Till the noise of the bickering guests had died .
" thus i gained the information ,
A guardian god to help and save .
Dying to win , yet living to be lost ,
The skies ca n't keep their secret !
Light she tripp 'd amang the bracken ,
To sweet consolings , that can grief expel ,
Dark grew the air with arrowy hail
With so much order made , there can be none
The ostrich eats him if he gets a chance .
Did a rough warrior who stood by
Taking all cheerings with a smile :
How to lose her weight of sorrow ,
Though trials came as duly as the day ,
Whose hope was crossed ,
Headlong , impetuous , see it pour ;
That faced my three-plank bed ,
To him who realm and life restored ?
Which the smile of the morning brings ,
The greater blessedness preserves the more .
Then rain and darkness on them drew .
Till every burning foot be set
Joined his psalms of praise
Then came the crowd in-surging like the wave
He went his way joy to impart .
The fountain sang alone ;
And the trailing white clouds , --
Until a great bridge lifts its form
Laws to impose to lands subdued by might ,
Suiting her worth , which might be seen
The world has fallen between us : thou alone
He thinks mine came to more than his ;
That set my spirit to swing on such a thread
Her fields are quickened , her forests crowned ,
Swift pity at his very heart-strings tugged ,
Besides , the tower upon that quarter found
Can shed a lustre o'er us
Where religion loves to come ,
Death struck my parents from my side
The leaves dance round her with delight ,
Hath been on every side laid bare to man !
The trotting ghost kept on the same !
Red rose leaves will never make wine ;
To whom mother church had just murmured
My lady 's presence makes the roses red ,
To order peace , to strike or yield :
The shadowy light of death 's eclipse was shed .
Thus did the master fill me with alarm ,
Where love lay dying ;
Makes the father 's heart to mourn .
And well enough that weapon served his stead ,
His wallet 's stuffed with blisses ,
The last red beam of the sun had departed ,
No ear their import can discern afar ;
The sound not wonted in a place so still
Christmas comes but once a year .
“ i will go forth and vengeance take ;
Nor attend to the blast ;
The rolling woodland comes ,
This said , and thus instruct , his letters signed
Ever first find favor with the graces
As rushing squadrons bear ye thence .
By hope of such advantage led ,
Summer 's season slowly stretches ,
While nymphs take treats , or assignations give ,
My heart doth charge the watch ; the morning rise
Profane the world that lies beyond the tomb ;
Upon my way to sleep before it fell ,
To hide the fraud . at interview both stood
No home , no haven where songs belong ?
After the fire a little more had roared
Tears dimmed them too !
Parted , alas ! i carry from its source ,
Then all in sad despair she made her moan ,
If you would span the way to god ;
Does faith begin to fail ? is hope departing ?
The mighty is fallen , our hope is departed --
And myrtles stir the sylvan air .
That it was just as bound to make me glad
When stormy winds disclose the dark profound ;
Of growth that pierced the sky , and hidden sat
Speak , that this plague be stayed .
Father , my heart to thee i bring ,
Of kindly deeds and actions wrought .
At which suspicion told him she was dead ,
Millions of opening mouths to fame belong ,
Recalls at dawn what midnight said .
But who can avoid the fell snare ,
So fills the nasal trump of fame .
And ceased to hope the clouds would be dispersed .
If they should rise and flow for me !
Disdainful , disappointed , turns he home .
Still the moons are waxing , waning ,
And so much hidden poison lies therein ,
In rainbow ripples borne from your heart in paradise .
Nor lifted to the light its drooping eye .
Gay the lights of heaven showed ,
Of pictures magical thy eyes unfold ,
As silent and sad as a bird newly caught .
With how much better stars the sky would shine ,
Such self-control is hard to bear ,
And turn the event , confounding human pride ;
Each cottage flower in sooth doth teach
Have been thy visits . make thy pleasure known ,
Let to the weak the lighter arms belong ,
Or serpentine , or driving arrows ,
Greatening and darkening as it hurried on ,
With flushing cheek and sighs deep drawn , wild cries
The strength they borrow with the grace they lend .
Is through the wood whose branches fill
That turns earth 's smoothness rough ,
Repeats the blunders that she made before !
Of spanless girth , that lays on every side
Anointed king , the throne shall fill .
And spanish ale shall give you hope ,
As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon .
Worth being poor to hold in fee .
The hope , and make it trebly dear ;
That in the saviour wholly puts his trust !
It touched the tangled golden curls ,
Once as red as life could make ,
As nature wears the smile of spring
Look , thou substantial spirit of content !
" thence arose the violation ,
( the fountains volleying golden glaze )
Still lay each martial graeme and bruce ;
" that some great continent approaches us :
Last carnival she made a deal of strife
A damsel she in all her secrets versed .
Their silken folds should feast the moth .
No hint i see of damning ;
Under which the bright sea heaves ;
Where thy love the golden seam doth sew .
For worship ' midst his fellow men . he reached
Till the god of heaven took pity on her ,
Of rugged atlas , who upholds the skies .
For i will have contention put to shame ,
The while the seasons go with blight and bloom ,
This stable now beholds a glorious day !
The boundless prospect opened . long he strayed ,
Which showered its fullest softness down on her ,
As old time makes these decay ,
My heart shrunk back and dared not hope that she
Be ever happy where thy smiles are seen ,
Not mine the grief which words may lighten ;
They turn their eyes to thalaba
Leads down and cuts the stronger range in two ,
Where the fragrant dew has trod ,
" oh , come now , alice ,
By the dear faces ye recall !
His frame by strong convulsion torn ,
To-morrow may bring a grief behind it
As lavish time comes down the way
From the same source of grace are sprung .
And wail upon wail went up to the stars
Life has fled ; she is dead ,
The echo seemed a cry of pity , sent
That 's the way the money goes .
Filling oafs with wisdom ,
And gave it rough and cruel twist ;
And penetrates the depth of polar shades .
I feel all the anguish within me arise
To bless the turf that wraps their clay . "
That name her infant tongue first learned ,
With youthful hours have faded all away ;
He flashed like light upon the scene ,
With courage no dangers can ever lay low ;
Less noble , being , as all rumour runs ,
From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat ,
So base affections fall , when virtue riseth .
That the light car which gold made fair ,
Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay ,
My heart consumed in everlasting fire !
Blue-eyed and beautiful she goes ,
Till he reached the quay , steel-fitted ,
Scatter in terror , while it slips
And the fanning wind puffed it to flapping flame .
And every pang that folly pays to pride .
And forthwith battle follows fierce and fell .
Where you have made your shrine
( her grandeur heightened by successive toil )
Thou mighty medium , potent to convey
That sound , my spirits deeply tried ;
Deeper the stillness hangs on every motion ;
Love framed with mirth a gay fantastic round :
With vengeance to pursue you sacrilegious crime .
Lips and cheeks with trembling passion burned ,
Only a mighty sadness fills
Bring love that knits all hearts in one ;
And with sad terror make weak hearts afraid ,
And the wind brings up the rain ;
Then all their mightiest men gave ear to him
That so your valour might more brightly shine ?
Anigh to which ill things do never come .
The meadow your walks have left so sweet
And steer thee safe to this forsaken land .
Do n't rashly take to dangerous courses --
I trace the varying chart of years ,
Filled with deep surprise ;
Whose rushing keels made music as they went
And his voice rang free and glad ;
Came the music , sweet and clear ,
Had cut the thread that kept their joys entire ,
By indistinctness given . -- then to decree
The gates of sleep stood wide .
Of the tomb chamber followed him .
Save that strange shadow , where before it fell ,
That steep and narrow scale admits to climb .
For public service . two steel arms he join 'd
And wits take lodgings in the sound of bow ;
And blissful peace within their breasts possessed ,
From rapture of the joy i felt .
The wind is rising , and you heard the leaves
Find safety but in doing . he that aims
E is the eye which those dark lashes cover :
Planets and suns run lawless through the sky ;
Nature had planted in her own sweet soul .
A sadness that would not be comforted ;
Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound .
Thy daring , roland , hath wrought our woe .
And no far distant page will show .
That trembled as it stuck ; nor void of fear
The exultation and the groans arose
Who can burst lust 's chains so strong ,
Round which the flaming sword forever plies
Unquestioning dread when death had round her stormed ;
Pure as an angel ’s dream shone paradise .
Each sense of body well controlled . ”
Banish their fears , he bids his cohorts dash ,
Where pain makes peace with pleasure in thy song ,
And the landscape flowed away behind ,
A polish 'd chest and stately robes to bear ,
That stubble stands where once large ears have been .
Trot , trot , the baby goes ,
For joy finds love grow bitter ,
Turned their last thoughts and closed their dying eyes ,
Those spotted squares shall come up sixes !
Give life to this dead wood ,
How he bought votes and consciences did hire ;
Now the trees sprang up and flourished ,
Whatever he dreams or feels .
It hides a secret to the birds
His helmet now shall make a hive for bees ;
At his body . but it lay bereaved
No nourishment receives in her disease ,
He whose boat with wealth is loaded ,
Holy head seeks out the holy body ;
It quieted pain and sorrow ,
But the sleigh stood still as the hind bob stuck
Upon this night no sentinels keep watch .
The cross that fell with all those glorious towers ,
Tis time to break oppression 's chain ;
Starting , while they the tales recall ,
That maketh them all worldly cares forget ,
Fast , fast the lengthening shadows creep ,
Where silence shall embrace
By this his dignity to stain or slight ,
That opulence departed leaves behind ;
When , as the vision gave command ,
And thy wrath laid and bound on me
Christmas comes but once a year .
The present marred with reason gone ,
Which over-flowed , whatever she had felt
They died , their brave hearts breaking slow ,
And the red cliff roses bore
Thro ' the prison bars now darting ,
Like tapers on the altar shine her eyes ;
The river as it narrowed to the hills .
My heart 's chain wove ;
Their eyes were fastened . clinging to his skin
As it rises from some lonely isle ,
Too soon i found my fault ,
In grief thy sallow mantle tear !
_ in _ with the river sunk , & c.
Answered in the words which follow :
Draws to a thin and sickly close , we hear
Forty times over let michaelmas pass ;
From that fell feast which glory gives the worm ,
It is the passing preciousness of dreams ;
Her daring project with the darkness grew .
It is the guilty soul that speaks . "
With silvery song she breaks the golden spell
Of light was never by apollo thrown :
Nor could his plated shield sustain the force .
And grecian fires consume the trojan walls ?
Belgia 's mild winters , others remove ,
And from young leo 's to his lodgings went ;
The city gave a space for air ,
Dreading a hope betrayed :
Their wrath for wrong made right
That the delight thereof me much releeved .
And in the dust the banner laid
And got his pay in yellow gold :
Of fancies woke within his teeming mind ,
All thy clouds do thou assemble ,
Were warm for winds to dip ,
Now has stumbled on his own perdition ! ”
Expecting death ; down came achilles ' blade
Her radiance to the stars is cast ;
Surpassing , who themselves did make the crown ,
In you the future as the past is given --
That streamed from sky to earth .
New friends shall pass and still renew
Gold spirals spattering , flashing ,
Because the spring-time has not come --
And far away the scattered volumes fly ,
Burst forth , and demon shadows fled away ,
A yelp as a tail hound caught the clip .
A deeper gloom invests the howling shades ;
" now the time has come for parting
Many widows left they mourning --
Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended .
There came a night of quivering moon magic
Where the strait alleys hide me , wall 'd between
Deep , where the bases of the hills extend ,
Licence repressed , and useful laws ordained .
O wind , bring my delight !
Of beasts ferocious . heaven a spot contains ,
And hissing flew the feathered fates below : }
Or spurred the tempest as a battle steed ,
Fortune relieves me ! for the hands which aimed
The heavenly hope-giver , hung in pain :
At least no natural winter there found place .
A change of place would suit my case .
Thy pledge has passed , divine .
And dusk bound gold about her hair and hips :
Then came the call for youth , and he
Such charms as your 's all hearts engage !
In sighing pines , and rills
Had begun to wear upon his nerves .
And when twilight falls the sleeping hills
Faces of the suicide , the murdered floated on ,
Your eyes will e'er attain such scope .
Found a means to quench the fire ,
Wherever fate may cast your rover ;
That with their weight they make the balances
Dismiss the people , then , and give command .
And part of memory 's best contentment grow !
That holy light is cast .
Shall lead thee to thy grave .
And when she took unto herself a mate ,
Still think you venus ' aid supports the strife -
The shameless fragment leapt . from crag to crag
A year has gone , as the tortoise goes ,
In these tossed seas what anchorage for hope ?
There rose a shout again , and yet again --
To welcome the marshal could not rise .
Its dim origin can trace --
With steeps that hang in the twilight sky ,
But the keen steel in neither reached the flesh ;
( a character , backed by my banker ,
While i proceed to frame a harmless song ,
There is a place hung o'er with summer boughs
Leave to the widower 's cares no path confessed .
Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky ?
And turn him like the cyclops mad with blindness .
Her cares they kept her in good cheer .
When the bright stars keep watch above ,
Soon they were fast in honest wedlock tied ;
And nenad , with courtesy address ’d them :
Had not the lord to him his folly shown ,
Blood issued from so many a gaping wound ,
The tired stranger where they fell .
I loved the lips from which it fell ,
Hers to bid life revive , " --
And fills with keen revenge , with fell despite ,
Within , the drops from dripping clothes went pat ,
Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat ,
She ever had of wonders there displayed ,
To flesh that fever makes a cinder of , --
His time kept , have be withinne .
I felt myself so sad and low ,
Beauty brings only words , not breathless tears .
We hold the outer wall ,
Withered , scorched , the spring-flower lies ,
Injustice ? it must be punished .
And seek his love to share .
The sunny rays , lest heat the blossoms kill ,
Which put the rump into a fright ;
But though my heart is buried in his grave
That promised boon , so long retained ,
The briefs came trooping gaily ,
In church he may not go to sleep ,
Our hope and strength renew .
And each shall wish his stature may be made ,
And with new fervor filled the hearts of men ,
Here death may deal not again forever ;
Only to yield thee gladness of my voice ,
Till the dark beads of his days are told .
The wind would blow such songs as these --
The god propitious gave the guiding sign ;
As flowers are drawn by sunlight . and there grew
Care on his brow sat chill and black ,
It curled all blue throughout the cave and flew
Music sings far off , flows suddenly near ,
To the forest , on wolves to make war .
The tangled roads reach from rim unto utter-most
Dreams often more than waking passions move .
Heavy to make the pale face sad ,
Victorious he his mighty triumph holds ,
One other hint we also find ,
See from my cheek the transient roses fly !
When sacrifice absolved our earth .
Whence the woods gathering watch new cliffs emerge
Iron , the iron world goes .
That his terror was revealed .
And this dear land as true a symbol shows ,
Their curbless power had been controlled in this ?
We can not always feel and think and act
The breath that gave it life was thine . "
Then she spoke the words which follow :
The gibbet in its terror stood :
Routed and crushed in battle strife ,
Still it whisper 'd promised pleasure
Nor time hath changed his hair to white ,
Of circling bliss in life
All the cares that hovered near ,
And circling wonders fill the vast profound .
And my love kissed me back again .
And the grasses lost their tassels ,
When wessex went to battle for the creed .
Nor borne the heat of noon ,
While scoffing infidels their voices join !
Can give -- of generous thoughts ,
Our fortune must be wrought ;
From whitening boughs i breathe the odors rare
Answered in the words which follow :
For if the lord no wardship take ,
And the fog lay on the river ,
His tongue could whisper words of might .
Now in mute stillness rested all the air :
Hath found a vanished passion all in bloom ,
Some stars will rise and wane , --
The passion that slays and recovers ,
On thee is fixed ; to thee i cry !
Enkindle this dear earth that bore us ,
But when flushed autumn and the snows went by ,
Heard the sad words which pierced him through ,
Not caring what the world 's deep voices meant --
Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair ,
Prone for his favourites to reverse his laws ?
Whole empires fall , swayed by these nice respects ,
When in their nascent passions , nations rise :
' a strife by ignorance to madness wrought .
And with whose name freedom unites our land .
Roll billowing : the crisp clouds pass
Whence arose her brain of evil ?
Evil , reaping all beneath the sun . "
Have traversed the wide sea of space that rolls
But hell itself conceived and spawned the military germans !
Careless of slaughter or defeat , to rush
Rush the flames to the sky
All the high heaven behind the roof lay thus ,
What our most holy order holds for truth )
Like the caged bird escaping suddenly ,
His kiss fell on her mouth .
As is the circle that around it turns .
By the same heavenly instinct taught and led ,
Each finds a mate and leads her home ;
Give the birches golden flowers ,
Or winds that blow them down ? "
But stung herself , while others feel her sting
Dead seemed the legend : but it only slept
Until my whole life 's striving is made vain .
Which holds three persons in one substance knit .
Then from thy lips the thrilling language fell ,
While alcohol flies to the head ;
I found the leading feature of his soul
Magian worship they paid to their sun ,
The watch now muster strong and dare
Canst thou ease the pains i bear ?
Holds their desire aloft , and hides it not .
Or the papers call it a war ,
Making for graceless things a grace ,
In earth or ocean , lies the boon ,
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt ,
What of a seeming falsehood bears the impress --
The book of deuteronomy declares
By which it keeps the secret it betrays ?
And , torn by frightened horses , quenched with gore
On them his radiance darted ; not a cloud ,
The other like a rose sprang forth
But quiet he lay nor returned her caress .
The wither 'd leaves all skip and hop ,
We might carry a royal ransom ;
And with the king to make accord
Springing ' neath your careless tread .
It made them feel quite bad ,
By choice they made themselves immune
To give thee comfort if i may . "
There , when the snows about us drift ,
As fiend and man in combat met ,
Freedom called , and called in vain .
For they their guilt with weeping will unfold ,
When thy merry step draws near .
Not with such blindness , not so lost to shame
That , overcome my power , i turned my back
In various cares the fleeting days he spent :
For years untold her youth will shine .
The minster-clock has just struck two ,
Descends , and draws behind a trail of light .
Let love restore the fallen to his home ;
Girt by his friends he thundered out
O'er all mankind he holds his conquering track --
By the dun cloak of darkness wrapped about ,
And time can heal the saddest hurts of love .
A name which it took of yore :
With glad songs come to abdicate
To thee my vows were breathed from every shore ;
The light , which burned brightly among us ,
Exulting bharat joined the crowd .
To flames without twice thinking , where it verges
And listed awhile to the balm-shedding breeze ,
With bonaparte to take his stand . " --
With eyes of stone still stand and stare .
Expectant waits , where truth from earth shall spring ,
And rise into offices fit to your mind --
Where the snow had drifted ; the subject dropped .
And in his angry ears hath poured the bane ,
-- and i found we were dancing .
Far off as wandering lovers go their ways .
Long ago was traced and written ,
Of morning , pierce the barcan wilderness ,
Yet made the misery of at least two lives .
The scorching sun came full upon his face .
And makes thee own his loving care .
And swells her breast with conquests yet to come .
Observing that i wept , he made reply ,
Hath lost the charm it bore ;
And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes ,
While the first whiteness into wings unfolded ;
Orlando draws to land , the billows sweeping ,
" let this head forever serve thee
Unto your royal home ' t will follow you ,
Imperfect , ere its organs gave it birth .
As wise as socrates , might justly stand
The brave meets danger , and the coward flies .
Once more the happy soil of greece did meet .
Joy for the world-wide peace to come .
To share war 's bitter price and grim ;
But france from rome and athens caught the flame --
The pulse of the night as it beat ,
While a great big tear stood in his eye ,
In slime where alligators creep , --
The strength of better thoughts , and seek their prey
There was a navy went into spain ;
Calm is all nature as a resting wheel .
And dreams of death make sweet the flowers
Nor stop to sleep -- where i have slept .
There comes no premonition now to show to me
Which of old time from fesole descended ,
Into the silver night . at once there flung
Till death should call from his midnight sea .
Straight sprang she to her lover on the bed ,
So many voices issued through those trunks
The same is kept of god who taketh heed
The seasons come again .
We fays made merry on arcadian lawns .
Write in civile this i finde :
Anon , her mind by wondering fear is wrought
The more it feels of pleasure and of pain .
Wretched man , whose years are spent
And courage lycia drew her chief defence .
Then broke the silence of those saints concordant
Welcome all and make good cheer ;
He called on death , and therein comfort found ;
Slow travelling , his way through centuries winning --
If earthly dreams be touched with gleams
And joy should live with me .
The time upon this hill will spend .
Sent the cool breeze to fan the burning brow ,
Till god released her of her pain ;
The hands we lay
Gives perfect signs of her delight .
The government bullock train toted its load .
No organ but the wind here sighs and moans ,
For if the darkness and corruption leave
This watch was made to buy him blisses
That rippled whispering round her , came .
Yea the lines hast thou laid unto me
Demons dance to the red moon 's light ;
A clergyman demands more gospel truth ,
Other new pain to plague me from without . "
Then shrank my heart within itself for dread ;
Everything moves that goes .
To rise above their country : might their law :
Lift sleepy heads to give us hail .
My soul goes higher still --
Where none can match her ,
And every triumph rome has seen
Sweet comfort yet shall fill my heart ,
Gone -- escaped -- flown from the shame and sorrow
Answer made the son of pohja ,
The solemn hills around us spread ,
Life should so long play with that breath
Better than world 's wealth should i find . "
Scarce had the last word left her lip ,
The flush of life may well be seen
That hides thy fallen greatness ! and thy name
My gains come softer still and faster .
By music taught its latent life ;
The crystal moisture , sprung from woe ,
Through the white-tops ' tossing snow .
And seek for vengeance on their harassed people .
I took for truth what was but sweetest seeming .
Or like the love which grew into my life ,
Smiles , come with tears ; therefore with hopeful eye
When rises in radiance the most royal of stars
The coffee fell and burn 'd her nose ,
It shows with kings that ignorance may dwell :
High roofs of temples shafted tall with pines --
The youth within their hearts had stored
Loss of members with it drew
Once more were earth , and in the distance rose
Superbly varnished , to the ice had come ,
Your eyes , that looked on glory , could discover
Their strength augmenting by his patriot name ,
The new years come , the old years go ,
Where one may count up every face he meets .
Elsewhere alas ! -- our later age hath lost
Sorrow was there made fair ,
Over the seething lake our pinions spread ,
We see how reason calms the raging mind ,
There lay they , all around them spread a veil
To balk resistless fate no way could find .
Cauld blew the bitter biting north
As drew blood to the eyes of older men .
Merrily , merrily , to welcome in the year .
The scourge is red , the spur drops blood ,
For victory shone on his latest breath ,
The tempest rushes through the sky ;
What time the warning note was keenly wound ,
Fallen for the gospel of your own belief ,
Enlarged it spreads around :
Except the gallows claim his due ,
Winter is fled ; fair spring 's melodious voice
The world shall come unto a council hall ,
As on he pressed to scale the lofty wall :
A blade that leapt and swept about ,
How heavy the earth lies now on her breast ,
This thought makes me very sad .
Over the hosts falls a brooding night !
And make them stand and meditate forever ,
Surrounded by enemies , who take counsel together against my
I find him always fast asleep ...
I have , to fill the highest church .
One moment , and the seeds of life shall spring
Till ye can tell how else our friendship came .
You would draw a gem from me ,
Accidents will come to heroes ,
That hour gars my heart beat warmly yet .
Wilt thou bear in mind his crime
While from his legions rose on high
Although not love , that moved his cruel sense ;
My eyes , when the darkness meets me ! "
Be prompt , and do as i direct .
The sea keeps not the sabbath day ,
Thus burn 'd the battle like devouring fire .
Vague shapes and forms ascend to spell
With rank infection deluges the land ;
Was one such as could never yield delight ,
To bring us back assurance in that faith ,
Straight to the temple they their offerings bore ,
The verse that told his grief , renewed :
Will give a crust in pity .
But i ca n't measure my devotion !
To hear the last advice he gave . ”
We stand as captives , and would not depart .
Souls that have swept the spiritual seas
Sweet sleep , that makes more short the night .
No winds we feel but west winds blowing free ,
Could draw the tear or raise the smile .
Took a haud on this heart
The holy church expects of thee no less ! "
And one took root and sprouted up ,
Till he made a little garden .
His hand the king stretched forth so free :
Of hope the praises in this height resound .
Right to the isle which all my smiles inspire :
Such terror bred that late consumed mass :
And wash my body whence the life has died .
The sweetest of aeolian strains that ring !
And zephyr breathes his warm prolific gales ,
Of power to pierce his raven plume
Thus his aged wife makes answer ;
Whose face reflects the grand display they make .
With worship and religion ' twill be filled .
Fate gave the word , the arrow sped ,
Where mighty atlas turns the spangled skies .
That moved and breathed in animated gold ;
The cross it brings i would not bear ;
My love shone forth , and i was overcome ,
Spoke aloud the words that follow :
Wherefore , methinks , resides the greater blame
'till hours of congress come .
A train of heroes followed through the field ,
Thy fancies come from emerald plots ,
Who felt anger more than pleasure .
The harem 's loveliness , white hands were seen
For it 's easy enough to retain a grin
My soul , disdainful and disgusted , sought
Then forthwith poured upon my head
To bring the marchman unto shame . "
By keen laments which from the tombs arose
Filled at least a thousand hogsheads
But tell of days in goodness spent ,
Which when melancholy thoughts come o’er her ?
He blush 'd with shame , nor made reply ;
' neath which she scarcely venturing goes demurely ,
To give repentance to her lover ,
The tripled might of hand that found in reach
As if the natural laws had all stood still --
Their shadows can not play with them ...
Thick bursting sparkles from the blows aspire ;
To many hearts by sorrow borne unto the earth !
A king might wish to hold in fee .
With bitter taunts that pierced and stung :
Feeling the fury of a deep revenge .
Not death shall shake , nor priestcraft break
But time is best measured by tears .
Answer in the words which follow :
The only art her guilt to cover ,
By chance , where he the rich deposit made ,
In the faith that looks through death ,
Women and men have only got one way
His own with such affection turned to her
The tumult till it died .
Then his brush drooped down till it sometimes dragged ,
Save that which cometh from the pure serene
Put life and mettle in their heels :
Old stings that made them bleed and smart --
Wisest love has made .
Like sunbeams flashed on pine or yew ,
Thus passing forth from the three qualities --
And many years slid by ,
So plans were laid without delay ;
A countenance in which did meet
And other steeds than lately led the way ?
The american spirit speaks :
Memories come to me here to-night
To penance had resigned .
Worship of moloch , tyrannies that built
All links of the low past were broken ;
A sweet forgetfulness of labour passed . ]
Lodging to those who in her markets meet ;
What thrilled thee through with trembling blessed ,
Where pleasure holds no universal sway ;
By the warm blood that mantles there .
And cool the fever of his wearied brain .
And time sinks crumbling into shattered space .
And battles tell from foreign land .
That leads to peace ? do they not rather seem
What sorrows attend you !
Answered in the words which follow :
Such wondrous power god to his saint will lend ,
I went with him again , and found in truth
To grasp the greater wisdom , reach not me ,
To brave patroclus gave the rich reward :
Pallidly the moon slides down ,
Christ was his master , and he made
Which in the dark earth lay ,
Vengeance has sped , the king is dead —
Whare hunters fand the murdered bairn :
When nothing else , not life itself , remains ,
And ever the truth comes uppermost ,
The viper 's severed body joins anew ;
When a shepherd filled with malice ,
He scarce had come to the twelfth commandment
At midnight hour bang went a gun ,
And in the dust a despot victim laid .
To memory ever clings ,
Were every soul swept from the yard .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Watch them like stars set in a lonely sky ,
And full of truth not shaped by thought ,
Sings , when his song sets fire
The vital joy that breathes itself in bloom ;
And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts ,
Willowy billowy now they 're bending ,
Some selfish motive to all tyrants binds ;
Beating the measure , rapidly trolled again .
That thro ' each living spirit went
By all the tears that fall ,
What for the sword that cromwell drew ?
Which marked the junior dean ;
And tears ran slowly down his cheek .
That cast their shadows upon road and bridge ;
Foreshadowing of joy , revived my heart ;
The night wind made a mournful sound .
You were to take a year ,
And the tears came
But ráma ’s heart inclined to spare ,
Till the lost sense of life returned again ,
There is a pleasure which is born of pain :
Detain from following thy illustrious track .
That the other , feeling lonely ,
With thee my soul could dwell for evermore ,
That changed us into soldiers ; swing your bells
And sadly make their charms decay ;
And every scratch a lance had made upon it ,
And midnight rancour grasps the cruel steel ,
And friendship brings thee now to greet
Whose broken heart bled at the feet of grief ,
Shelley , thy spirit is set among the stars ;
It o'er them spreads its slime and mud .
His pale mouth to the brightest mouth it met
There rested his victorious powers .
When guilt itself a human tear might claim , --
But the best o n't came after the ball ,
The writing must be letters maim 'd , that speak
They take the happy air beneath ; )
Wherein the shreds of human thought ye twist ,
The unwise people take ; what best men do
Comes the thought of the gracious presence
Of the pale temple , shot the glistening rays ,
So awful an infection smote the air ,
To tread the humble paths of earth .
So , take and use thy work :
The silly myrtle deemed its own .
Of that grim conflict , saw where never ceased
How cheerfully the week was spent !
" i hold that woman guilty of a sin ,
Which in its turn shall sure be met .
And leave us leisure to be good .
He gains his side and hard he strikes his shield
Earth still clings to its eye-sockets ,
And every echo learns the words of love ,
Could not mistake the words it said :
And with evil greeting his foeman faced .
Unarmed if any meet her ,
They nobly drew the sword for war
Through shifting veils of tender mist ,
Had found a cruel lodgment in her breast .
With proper instruments they take the road ,
God of our fathers ! make it true .
But it wo n't stop to baby him .
But frantic keeps the forward way .
Those gleams of soul to every feature given ,
In flattery completely doused ,
And by all the stars of christ that sink ,
Of science , now made ready to attack
Thy banks should echo sounds of fear !
Amid his bursting sobs
To lay their riches at her feet .
To new appearance . meeting these , there came ,
O mother ! take their counsel , and so shall
And a fragrant crimson rose-tree follow 'd :
For the soldiers go to war beyond the seas .
And fix the fair face in it 's prime .
The babe lies yet in smiling infancy ,
A mechanic his labor will often discard
Banner-like high thoughts are flying ,
As crushed lips take their respite fitfully ,
There came no news of him .
These fishers in black torment tossed ,
Till art is but a formal figure , bringing
Of regal grandeur , whence the eye discerns
Tumbled a horror . like a roaring sea
Behold ! the day of southern glory comes .
The sight which makes supposed terror true .
The light that swims upon the light of things .
To take leave of thee , great plant !
And the spell closes with its silent seal --
Healing for this great anguish that i bear !
Their songs ring through the air ;
And make thee truly all thou dost appear
But there met a frost so great ,
And to the silence made a gentle moan ,
Across the swelling sparkle of the waves .
Save a flush that goes and comes ,
The pointed crystals shot their trembling light ,
The reputation which his friendship gave procured him many
With hosts of little strings that pull
Only to show , how many tastes he wanted .
What time aloft their kindred banner flew ,
Where guilt and poor misfortune pine !
Which back as clear translucent waters gave ,
To spill their hearts out blindly in a kiss ,
With all that follows in its train ,
Too self-amazed to shape itself aloud ,
To lift in hope these weary eyes
They will crush me and grind me to mire ,
The soap slides round and round ;
The poem-butcher turns with gleeful shout
It bears aloft their slippery tread ,
A hope , long nursed by me ;
And on wild violets when she treads
The hand that follows intellect can achieve .
That issued from its brink . on earth no wave
The valiant phthians leading to the fight ,
Bring the new music of mankind to birth ,
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
Was found of any thing to fear ,
All daylight wanting to disperse the gloom :
So tangled in its custom 'd toils that smile
A flame sent beating through me ;
Felt life and sense and strength restored .
Which led me to that lady 's bower
When southern gales have summon 'd you away . '
Trembled with quickening thrills , and stirred .
Then he raised a warmth like honey ,
To wake and find the fancies of the brain
The watches of the night grow hoar ,
To breathing dusk and arrowy moonlight vowed ,
For thee my heart is torn ! "
It came forth , beautiful and silently ,
Your drenched loose hands were stretched to hold
And hector 's prayers alone now reach his ear .
Now sloping down to sorrow , mounting now
The gay vision melted away ;
Hath power , directed thus , to bend elsewhere ;
No eye can pierce their yellow gloom .
News came that left to constance not a grace ,
Cast down by thunder , wallowing in bottomless abode .
Their torches tossed a ladder of fire ,
" there comes not death
Bright with blood your friends have shed .
How wide the persian sea extends to sight ;
The shriek of the damned raised in vain ,
This blessing given of beauty that endures ,
" why has n't it got a heart ? "
Have you found your life distasteful ?
A closer kinship claims these isles ,
To put folk in a fright ,
The holy stillness that suspends our breath
The years have sped since first you stood
Such sights has memory to show ,
And now the white clouds sail along ,
Into the air , as only love can fly ,
A kindlier influence reigned ; and everywhere
Here make i proclamation of my faith ,
Is none that shows an honest scar before .
For in my blood glad aspirations swell ,
For earth alone will never bear
He his quiver takes , and bow ,
And joy flows everywhere ;
And yet the mischief gathered force and spread ,
Since my last hope and last comfort is gone !
" i have passed the age for wooing ,
Did not let this bring me sorrow ,
None , none but shadows to those mansions go ;
Filling the air with melody ; and at times ,
These hearts were woven of human joys and cares
All the water flushed with crimson !
I took the red rose from my heart ,
Heard solemn , goes the goblin story round ,
And if reproach seemed hidden in my pain ,
And as the lusty lover leads her in ,
As near the icy marge a walrus lay ,
Like flashing moths upon the wind that ride .
Can you keep the bee from ranging
Axe , spear , and sword , directed well ,
Where nature is wrapped in mystery deep ,
An evergreen , that stands the northern blast ,
From whose affection men should shrink as loath
To bones and marrow the sensation comes --
With breathless nostrils stretch 'd above the spring .
Nor the roman courage that never yields .
The conscious stone to beauty grew .
You who have mingled death with beauty ,
And orderly the living work they bend .
A chill comes with the afternoon ,
While night began to fall ,
Like those short sweets here knit together .
That shines o'er sorrow 's tear .
To the notice such beauty resents if withheld .
How yet the regal aspect he retains !
He heaves no sighs and he sheds no tears ,
Bid the seas arise and stand
My son afar : these marks i see ,
If thou the truth wouldst teach ;
If venus favor not then all is lost .
When all in mist the world below was lost .
But though her timid manner fled away
And rolled on its harmonious way
That such misery could follow ,
And quench their thirst beneath that brazen sky .
Not happiness itself makes good her name !
Till on his life the sickness weighed ;
Sensations as of pins and needles rose ,
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
She 'll tear our senseless arguments to tatters ,
Till april dying made free the world for may ;
Strong and courageous to the strife arose .
And scorned the tempest as it passed .
But your white spirit still walk by my spirit .
The likeness of a throned king came by .
Remember troy , and give the vengeance way .
Then i 'll give thee truthful answer . "
And the still river shining as it flows ,
O reader , hear a novel trick revealed .
For late i find the nations are my foes ,
With strength renewed and confident in faith
Joy comes and goes , hope ebbs and flows
To adam what shall come in future dayes ,
What hast thou found in the spring to follow ?
And fear of death deliver to the windes .
But they stood by the cannon like marines
My entrails gnawed by the blind worm of hate ,
Dull and low his fire was burning ,
Behind her lay a world in arms ; for now
Before the fingers touch it shrinks with dread .
That hide a happy light
So hector swept the grecians . then defeat
Thy beauty can not hold my heart .
And falters ere sufficient words be found :
That i be call 'd to take a nap
And in reverence danced .
And when the sons of greece held in dispute
Which melts like kisses from a female mouth ,
Where the bright colour from the dye goes not ;
Makes sure olympus , heavenly powers combining ?
But in that he his promise ill maintained ,
Move heart towards heart by sympathy .
No peace that mother 's features wear ;
Stripes and a dungeon ; and his body serves
And still 'd is the monarch 's tread ,
She begged thee not to let it go ,
Stars trembled in broad heaven , faint with pity .
Wagons run by gasoline --
His eager arms around the goddess threw .
And love may ripen in the shade ,
Call to mind how bright the vanished angel hours ,
From indwelling evil these souls to release ,
And sorrow 's shafts fly thicker ,
There lies not any troublous thing before ,
't is said they break alone
Brief absence joined anew to feel ,
The more the kindled combat rises high ' r ,
Our hearts lie buried in the dust
The holy fast hath reached its end ;
Still as she was -- no charm forgot --
Praise and glory to god now belong ;
When the smooth ground pressing !
Through all the mail of iron hearts would glide ;
The fruit of the olive puts forth .
With a strange rushing music . o my soul !
Or put thy body to labour or to payne
Thus quietly thy summer goes ,
But , whether from some human hand it came ,
Over the world he comes to win :
Throughout which many limpid rivers ran ,
The gael maintained unequal war .
Fill their fondly cherished homes .
God make my life a little flower ,
To pass ; this palace did the god contain .
To their possessor will bring good luck .
And red war slipped the shuttle through ,
The speedy gleams the darkness swallowed ;
A little thoughtful pause it made ;
So swift they follow who their turn must gain .
She folds indifference round her budding life .
And then there came long agony .
But when did kindness fail to find
From my heart i give thee joy ;
The words divine had raised in her , she passed
The sleepless deathless life within thee grasp , --
For resignation ever soothes the woful soul .
How soon my lucy 's race was run !
The mavis sang and felt himself alone
She will never make thee happy
Plucked ere their buds could blow ,
Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace ,
And stand above your pity . think ye me
The archers shot their arrows sharp and keen ,
Like one that came some tidings new to tell :
Its cold , its solitude . when slumber found
Your valors must , directed by my skill ,
And shall that mournful fate be shared by thee ?
And loved his good mother and took her advice ,
Make sense to perish , by disseverment .
There burns a truer light of god in them ,
To front their anger raging at its height
And your fortune is made from to-day .
" my babes no single step could take ! "
And shrink because the path to glory lies
Where love reigns all supreme , and all is bright
Were those which virtue gave him .
't is not that now no joys remain ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
That calls the black deep down --
Must oft have risen from many a lonely sea ;
Rise and rejoice ! " their ready voices raise
He felt that wrong with wrong partakes ,
From a kingly house descended ,
The task of new discoveries falls on me .
There had the persian 's thousands stood ,
It may be all my love went wrong --
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn ;
Which for its captain well might stand in fear ;
The bark majestic lay ;
And vowed to follow whither he would guide .
Puts coldly out its gradual shadow-claws ,
And it spoke , and thus protested :
With bright-winged birds , the mountains lay ,
Till an indian paper found that he could write :
Of which my comedy cares not to sing ,
He bade his heart go to her ,
Of winter , when the moon is tossed
While walls lie low as trumpets blare ,
Sometimes an animal , when covered , struggles
Holding talk with nations ?
She gives him all things , counting it gain .
Right through his manful breast darted the pang
Where beauty is not seen to charm ,
Nor fame nor censure they regarded ;
Tried warriors all , he thus addressed his speech :
We twain , with mutual pardon asked and given
One note for her ! deep streams run smooth
All other loves are lost in only thine ,
I pine for the peace of my childhood again ;
Which in her prescience she controlled still ,
The world he rests in , world he knows ,
The queen in the lofty hall takes her place ,
Down on the conflict that rages below them ,
By tales of dirt and danger fondly thrilled .
Watching at hand , from his disguise arose .
I can not grasp the shadows as they pass .
Prevailing , lured him with the bait of love .
Which like a garden manifestly show
What we should follow , and whence flinch , --
_ mystery : time and tide shall pass ,
Reverberated pleasures fire the breast .
And all around the candle the crooked shadows come ,
Yet once a year when the night has come
By lapse of time unto dim ruin brought .
And the violin weaving the waltzers a story ,
But each day brings its petty dust
Duty and care fade far away
But sealed that hate with a name divine ,
With us that take it .
The violet fluted with amber ;
And healing from your faith my wounds receive .
Anon , and years dealt listlessly away ;
Our hearts are bounding with delight !
Who , following hannibal , had passed across
Will flicker in the newly opened leaves ,
New themes of sorrow , sought in distant lands ?
For it knows nothing of great pageantry ,
The darkness fell , and i was left alone .
The motor hearse came round for him .
" o ghost or angel of my buried love ,
Life may pass , but love , undying ,
Just as your elenor murray joined the church ,
A frown is more than i can bear ;
Poor toys to soothe such anguished pain .
And yet how still the landscape stands ,
Of justice doth run counter to the edge .
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings ;
Since the beginning . he shall find the strange --
But deal direct with michigan .
He that sends the cruel winter ,
Freshness to feel the eternities around it ,
That all our voices made ; and back we shrank
Much taken with that lustrous smooth delight ,
And a kindly look that he turns upon
To bring the world deliverance , and its bliss ;
That only serves to make us grieve
And between them lies the orient -- struggling and
Stray lower , where the pleasant fountains lie .
As placards tell of my renown !
Yet , passing where it first sprang into life ,
This sacred twilight power to drive away
Golden the train windows go .
Calm smiled the lake ; and from that smile arose
Then back pursues his homeward way alone .
The fondness into which she had been led .
In safety lead them , where the other crag
And shapes mad fancies into facts ?
To think what sermons the old vicar made ,
The years go fast in oxford ,
The flames by fits curled round the bars ,
And with such stillness smites our hearts ,
He brought himself to tremble in each vein .
And cast the dark foundations deep ,
White roses climb the wall of night .
The tomb , and found the strait dimensions wide .
He turned away , she burnt with fury hot ,
And , while from storms of beating rain }
Those lips , whose touch cou 'd almost turn
It fell in the dusk of the night
By pensive sadness , not by fiction , led --
Have reared their stately heads so high ,
And all my gladness changed to grievous ire :
Then on the leopard his fangs he bore .
So fast the bonds of duty bind .
He stretch 'd himself in grief and radiance faint .
Plagues that rose to blast the day
't is that i do see herein
And gives thy pen both skill and argument .
Did only make the hag bewitch them worse .
She only heard it and it passes bye .
Speak prose and hollo it till europe hears !
To make confession , take communion . she
Could make assignable , -- and then
To deal and shuffle , to divide and sort
And such she fitted to old melodies ,
Thou dost look down the ages to defy
- rather a world of pressing men in arms ,
Over the great flood : thetis made their paths
The mausoleum murmured as i spoke ;
So , through the thunder comes a human voice
In music sweetly stole away ; --
And restless day gave place to torturing night ,
Pierced by whose darts a thousand nations bled ,
And soared , and bore to god my heart .
Called strife and blood and hate .
That does not sting me with ecstatic pains .
Glided and past , and close upon it pealed
Forthwith up rose the consul ,
Where rivers pass ;
Kiss me , and let me feel you very near
Answer in the words which follow :
Into deep substance he reached , and lo
By the great woe that in him wrought .
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart ;
It makes me feel as round and warm
And go prepared for changes . now you look ,
E'en the realms that evil calls its own ?
Where the wings of life may spread
So far as honor 's laws received no breach .
She had nothing to give him but her love .
Serve , that will give thee ere thou die
Wilt thou assume the nurse 's care ;
And sounds of sobbing smothered close and low ,
Is every weight now laid aside ?
When cromwell spake the word democracy !
Foul usury doth not more lift itself
Driving rain and falling tears ,
And sympathetic sorrow fills my eyes ;
And now it tells of italy .
And grows one pure idea -- one calm soul !
We make delay , that somewhat first the sense ,
For sleep to change its play ;
She held to all a winning smile ;
Her beauty also seem 'd to form no clog
Unseared by all the sorrow seen .
Where busy type old journals doth explore
Share of truth was vainly set
What would have made him joyful she concealed ,
Answered in the words that follow :
While the still morn went out with sandals gray ,
Now like a spider wrapped in his own snare ,
" each gale comes fraught with sounds of woe :
Our love where we spent our toil ,
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven 's thunder ;
That every hyacinth the garden wears
Turned into a ballad and some new scenes added .
I find it full of change ,
Still the light bridge hangs o'er the lake ,
Parted , alas ! i carry from its source ,
Since that my penitence comes after all ,
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made .
All things is fer the best , and fixed
Are in a tomb of wrinkles laid ;
And , should it chance as it may be ,
It gave me strength only to look at them .
Die , and the leaves go mourning to the mould
Your hopes , and only your dreams remain .
Wisdom walks in ancient ways ;
That humour interposed too often makes ;
Nor wounded heart that ever bled --
With such fell cruelty were seen , their goads
Old greece a tale of athos would make out ,
Of the windy spray that glides
That source of evils not exhausted yet ,
He shall not fall in sin who fronts the task
And nations rise where nations fell before !
Like distant clarion feebly blown ,
I nothing have retained except the grace of god !
And began to blow a cheering
Nothing but wisdom gives the first ; the last ,
Then take the vantage whilst you may :
No measure in her filthy loue she found :
This testimony i would bear of them ;
And taught him when to be reserved or free :
His rays resistance met . i turn 'd aside
Through glance of sunlight , streamed through broken cloud ,
And find a deuced balance with the devil .
May find himself within that isle of riches
Time passed . the elder consort bare
The troublings of her spirit as she strayed ,
Your case of grief they wholly miss ;
We shudder in tracing these terrible lines ;
Flashes of fearless thought , which spoke
Then a humour more great took its place
The tears came in her eyes :
Death will appear , -- the warning intervene .
Has closed his mystic wings :
Something or someone watching made that gust .
Had he met with death .
" where may i secure a swordsman ,
Although as signs they hang on various inns ,
No musing mind hath ever yet foreshaped
And tracing to their hidden source
The morning light had found them there .
To clear your doubts , if any can .
Already showed how light of foot we were ,
From her bench the witch made answer :
Before great love this monument did raise ,
And the green turf she joy 'd to tread ,
For truth makes pallid watch above the dead ,
Thy laughter shall not give thee ease ;
To show to man the empire of thy power ,
Until his soul of freedom sings ,
The rains of parted clouds thus meet .
The letters have combined , something was made .
Pour , let the wines of heaven pour !
Affection brought you to nay view ;
The wounded monarch at his tent they place .
They took the wind and let it go .
His limbs were cast in manly mold ,
Stammered , and could not make her a reply .
Only the first renewed -- the heathen 's choice ,
And the vapors that arise
Till it sorrowfully trailed in the dust .
It chanced that when the priest would kneel
Over against my bed , there shone a gleam
In silence and in darkness seize their prey .
The distance which separates incredulity from faith is
Has it not opened doors that had been closed ,
In vain the birds give thanks for christmas sheaf ,
One minute bounds thy bane or bliss ;
Of retribution fiercely works in me . "
And time brings truth , and truth makes free ,
Where spasms were kicking up a furious frolick ,
Her treachery done , again got to a cloud .
His large full eyes in anguish rolled ,
Which only age can bring ?
The passions own thy pow ' r.
A tear stole slow and silently ;
These rolling waves of a trembling awe !
From pleasures now viewed but as dross .
The event , the horror anyway , sprang out ,
Like parting friends that linger as they go .
Hearts that beat with love so true ,
Well i perceived the venom of her meaning .
And the same thought he gave to them
And fixed his gaze upon the skies :
Full ten centuries they lie
The boatswain gave the dreadful word ,
The brook in fear beheld the sight .
For ony wife i see .
Hundreds of saxon homes a-blaze and tossed
But he shall fade into a feebler age --
And give to him my sunny joy .
Took notice that brave lovelace did inspire
Reels from the joy experience brought ,
Fierce to the field of death the hero flies ;
Doth his heart fail him ? doth he fall away
And who and what should from him claim descent ,
To lay out fortune 's gifts ; and niccolo
I part aside , and hold communion free
Beyond the search of any eye they tend .
Which to mankind is dealt in different measure ,
An ancient town was seated on the sea ;
Where musty volumes hide themselves , --
Hell sees the victor come at last ,
No pleasing melancholy hails .
As over the struggling form they leant ,
Who make the world dance to their song ,
That glorious in its beauty showed
Under a grey dawn , timidly breaking ,
Quick to read in the wife 's sad eyes ,
And the new lives , born for eternal sway .
O smith ! which must your kind indulgence crave ,
Then , like one who a wicked spirit bore ,
Thro ' the aeons that have run ,
Can ye no put your trust in him ,
Yō ' life soon come an ' go ;
Firmly she made denial ; together came to her
With the people filled with witchcraft . "
Let these clouds bring snow and
He turned his speech , " in this unused place
And many a holy text around she strews
Some followed him to hear his sweet , clear voice
The inspired begins -- the onward march is given ;
What some gothic brain designed ;
Whose fond affections no dear puppies share .
My blood is poured in the dust ,
Of life and fate we would miss ,
Till sleep takes place of weariness .
My strength is gone , my limbs are old ,
So many voices issued through those trunks
Led his wife -- as young and handsome .
Which , thoughtless of the world , hath grown
It is so broad it covers the whole sky .
A nuisance were , which now they find ,
The lonely of heart is withered away ! "
" for midnight comes apace " --
A moment stops , lies then a hundred years ,
Voice moved ; -- only the torrent broke
This racks the joints , this fires the veins ,
Descends and burns to meet with thee .
Brutes with whose screams the trembling forest shook , --
That seem affection forth to show ,
Needs must they , being alive and drawing breath ,
Less doubtful , as that worthy shade complied .
Heavens , with what graceful majesty he treads !
Already in the surge of shadows caught ,
A veil of dust and ashes spread .
There lay the pond , still willow-bound ,
Its image would survive among his thoughts ,
Help me to see the highest in mankind !
Now that ill-spent life has fled .
That the imperious suitors thus should weave
It shames the constancy that fled
Was what brought on my indigestion ;
A victim owed to my brave brother ’s death .
When somebody , through years and years to come ,
But by his own impetuous courage led ,
The road that runs up to messines !
" let yourself slide down among us ,
Of gems , that in their bright shades play .
Rose to the god from whom it came !
To put the dumps to flight and shame ,
With willing hearts we bend ,
Of a life long dead and gone .
There came to me a sudden far-off sound
The pious chief , who sought by peaceful ways
I know not what the future holds ,
Floated the hum of voices , and the sweet
Hence matched anew , stands either infidel .
Yet that old love came
To hide a heart , which broke the while
Down came the blow ! but in the heath
As once the nations round him lay .
On remembrance reflected with colors as warm --
Unshaken , rear a realm that shall remain .
That when it came her hearing almost tore .
Are the only things that wander there .
Which answered for a table grand ,
The damsel throws herself , in her despair ,
With him , from castle was to castle bound .
Making thy waves a blessing as they flow . _
That aims to trace the secrets of the skies ;
How sweet to die and escape from anguish !
Her morning sun , which rose divinely bright ,
Thy votary bends , the mystic veil withdraw ;
He cheered them on till they made it good ,
To cast my violets with as reverent care ,
Renew their hearts with christ-like faith ,
That made or sign or show came to just ,
From the bright hopes of life forever gone ,
The herald of her triumph , drawing nigh
The light of truth shall shine again ,
To veil the joys too sacred to be seen .
With my broadsword filled with fervor ,
While the dim raven beats his weary wings ,
Which came and went , yet ever nearer grew ,
Within this roof , glory 's contracted sphere ,
Shall fill my heart with music sweet and calm --
That seem too heavy for tremulous water to hold .
A beggar 's soul has passed !
The summer zephyr , comes this breath , divine ,
In the autumn breezes danced !
Such quiet sleep has come to them !
Till earth did waver and fade far away
For the grace that through the lattice streamed
To take revenge on god she sought ,
Whose soul sees souls of others face to face ,
Protected and made proof against the powers of evil ,
How could i manage , live , exist ,
And shine forth in happy overflow
She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair ,
Some greater learned wit will magnifie .
The beauteous head his art had made .
Yet when a tale comes i ' my head ,
That brightened for us here and there
The mellow light still lingered in the west ,
The prudent prince the assembly viewed
Strange hands are laid , to feel the beat
Might fit old autumn for his royal rule :
One trophy more to added victories ;
Their threatening march . an eager look he cast ,
Faith to keep each promise spoken !
And hid her face of dread ....
For when thy charms my sober thoughts engage ,
And sunbeams melt along the silent sea ,
Of sacrifice , and made the martyr strong
Than that dull shade which waits on night :
And broke by continents of vast extent
With that old silver heart i gave ,
Still how sweet a perfume it will yield !
While from his lips the melting torrent flows ,
I summon up remembrance of things past ,
No art , no care escapes the busy lash ;
At old rebecca 's cottage gave a knock .
Of a dream that comes to me ,
Love of my kind alone can set me free ;
The spirit of her voice had moved above
But the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather
The music of thy nature folded round
It is laid with this kiss on your fingers --
And felt himself heroic . league by league
Lo , after many days love finds its own !
When the bee-hive casts its swarm ;
On the bird he has put in a song .
Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar
Within the aśoka garden came
The thing i bear is a lesser thing ,
My humble verse demands a softer theme ,
But was dreamed and done in the ages gone ;
Who now in glory shines ;
Against god 's pleasure , than that fruit which makes
That her beauty can give laws
Nor look for mercy from the incessant surge
Her houses rise in goodly show :
Call upon a higher power ,
So when bold homer makes the gods engage ,
Thither take the lid in colors ,
Whene'er the sun may go ,
While nature holds her fragrant breath at dawn
The sound of the hunting had broken his rest :
Than this -- that soars and sings , --
Hath evening , bringing change of scenes and friends ,
And fill ’d with anguish her immortal heart .
To this insolence made answer :
Delighted hymen gives his torch to blaze ,
't is love that makes the heavens shine
Of all our hearts can meet with here --
Then grinds him back into eternal death . "
By fame are raysed .
That guilt might cleanse , or sooth despair .
Talent from sober judgment takes its birth ,
Toward it springs the hapless maiden ,
By seeing every good therein exults
Those looks were designed to inspire love and joy :
Our frailty can sustain , thy tidings bring ,
Tho ' oft they 're overcome with heat ,
My withered walking-staff had come to bend ;
As witchcraft gleaned from old blackletter books .
Nothing but wisdom can untie the knot ;
The rose from her cheek had departed in fear ;
And music took the place of tossing hay ,
How tired we feel , my heart and i !
Wicked witch that sent these troubles ,
The banks of tor shall echo his alarms ;
The clouds dispel ; the winds their breath restrain ;
His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely ,
That sense feels more than what doth sense contain ?
That holds the treasures of the universe !
The officer his aid now friendly lent him ,
Hunger and thirst come on me for the tomb .
No sorrow soothed , no joy enhanced since shared .
And sleep stood trembling face to face with death .
The stain of thy wing is washed away ,
The torch my fathers gave in trust ,
At least the hope would have remained in store
_ sink or destroy _ ! the deadly signal flew
I sought all kinds of cheering things to say .
Vivid as lights that gild the northern skies ;
' you lose by breaking rules , you see !
My love these years could never have withstood . "
Far rang the mournful sound : mine own ,
Whose rapid wings thy flight convey ,
The poet wrought a song of joyance , thrilled
That it resembled thunderings following fast :
All thy longing shalt thou keep .
You caught the murmur of the rill which gave
But for this prayer thou wilt not bind in hell
_ folly _ went first ,
And now ( the banquet from the spits withdrawn )
Will shed it for exile of erin ,
Nor like air the air extended
The albatross did follow ,
By man 's lost hope and failing trust ,
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of may ,
Surpassing , who themselves did make the crown ,
And men delight in love their days to spend ?
His garden well loaded with store ,
The faithful spouse rejoined remembered love ,
My soul strayed , homeless , finding its own needs
And forth his voice of terror throws :
We who have grandly fill 'd our time ,
They shrink for fear , abated of their rage ,
Hark how it warbles and rings ,
To follow thee or perish at thy side :
How sweet to me the sang that fills
His voice was buried among trees ,
Heaven had not crowned his wishes with a son ,
Shall make thy actions with their ends to meet .
With the golden bow of promise as it drips .
He feels each moment of his life go by .
For ever may roses divinely blow ,
He comes , the broken heart to bind ,
The youngest pigling follows epicurus ,
The stream of slaughter as it sank ,
With colour as of fire , she made response :
Where holy echoes chant the adoring strain ;
Into the deepest woods she took her way .
Her trembling soul might flit away
And drowse the stirring spring with snow " ;
Made way , and a strange whisper surged around ,
And when he fixed his gaze upon my breasts ,
That numbs the soul with icy hand ,
Of arts is assembled in you ; --
For which he own 'd a present appetite ,
Were forged the anchors of thy hope !
Northward the road runs to the sea ,
Feeling the slow tears start
Who , as their years pass onward , seem
There seek my lost repose ,
Strange and sweet the calm that followed ,
See ! what a host the conqueror leads ,
One bough sustained his trembling weight ;
Instruments that buzzed and sung
When steel and fire go roaring through your head .
To wipe out the sin of a wife .
For , as this sweet life passes by ,
All night he fought for air :
May find some sunny spot .
And , shamed and blushing , brown the letter took
Like giant curses overthrown
I gave aunt ruth no peace , until she planned
It was not hers . she felt a trembling stir
I strove to keep my record free from blame ,
And gave the fates another form of death .
To lend a listening ear ,
It 's more and more i pine for --
They chase our double darkness ; nature 's gloom ,
When joy comes with the morning light ,
How heavenly soft their slumbers lie !
To mine , it serves for the old june weather
Till lost in air amid the seraphim .
Which served the high-court of justice ,
Silver bursts cut
Then hearing what had thither brought the knight ,
This book contains the following fables
To pour their tears for his broken heart ,
Cheap music blared and evil alleys sprawled .
My thought by death be taken !
A blaze of flame behind me streamed ,
For this voice a whole life spoke aloud .
His answer , reverent , thus returned :
As far rolls back the selfish undertow ;
Or stops the pitcher 's curves and throws .
From which the secret nobody could rip :
O , take good heed they be not lost
And ran the sage to meet ,
It owes its inspiration to n 457 .
Her lucid glow in glow will lift ;
Down sunk the sun behind the western hills
And brought no new style 's change .
And one month 's study makes a learned divine ;
A parley hector asks , a message bears ;
Containing a humble request , and a hope ,
And singly fill a feared and envied throne !
In slow procession bore from off the plain .
Almost by heart , who made the greatest speech
For he , that conduit running wine of song ,
The teeth o ' time may gnaw tantallan ,
Idleness hath held me fettered ;
He will return to the old faith he learned
For the legend runs that crag the saint ,
To patience , which all evil can allay .
She can dress her eyes in love ,
Were felt to culminate in her ,
Have led me to the fort of love .
The evening found us whom the day had fled ,
To load with blessings and unload from sins .
To imprint a kiss that lacked not power to spread
None but shades attend man 's frame ,
By thy love was lit ,
Take heart ! the promised hour draws near ;
The winds began to muster , and the sea
Have i not culled as sweet before ?
And which for many a day its virtue keeps ,
The which do endless matrimony make ;
The breeze their magic path attends ;
Gives either iron rim of the wheels a jolt .
Whose fume the dawn made fire .
Angry grew and sighed for vengeance ,
Their fury seems to burst the earth and skies !
Which fills the lungs at every breath
The fear that came anon ; i was transformed
To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon .
No high ambitions fired his breast ;
Where no relief might come .
Within , a hundred spirits and more there sat .
Out rushed his song , like molten iron glowing ,
That sin obliterates and sets at naught .
His soul , proud science never taught to stray
With loneliness that will not rest
I sought long days amid the cliffs thinking to find
Leave battles to the turkish hordes ,
Pondering his face and searching . " not so brave
But sweet flowers slipping from her loosened hair .
Say , what treasures will you hold ?
He turned his hand to matricide ,
And my cold blood hangs shivering in my veins ;
Some lucky star has led my steps this way .
A blessing sent before thee from the heavens ,
And the great worth of life appear ;
Stirred the blue quiet of the italian sky ;
Is less afraid to stir the hive and see
I hold these two . contentment comes when sought ,
Make war upon this bloody tyrant , time ?
Shall all bring happiness to thee .
There stood the hill-man heed thereof keeping .
And wanton lice through all their ringlets ramble .
Of fair things blowing ,
And hearts are strung so that one touch ,
Would fall like sunlight on this paper here .
In vain the pallid clouds refuse to share
Climbs up to fill the world with light ;
I felt a sense of pain when i beheld
My heart goes out with thee ;
And from its frame a soul dismiss 'd for spite
With his fair image facing him forever :
In a lingering fever many visions come to you :
I set me there to practise barratry ,
These are traps to take fools in .
Few words relate their carnage , plunder , fire ,
That chastity shall take no harm .
That , when a soul is found sincerely so ,
From the misty realm , that belongs
With keenly taunting words addressed
He ca n't recall the creature 's name !
And feel those christians fit to join in lays
Cause of reproach will come of it
E'en when eyes and hands drew nigh .
No scattered foe to face , but lucifer .
As love of pleasure is ordain 'd to guard
Sweeter than the rich scents that gardens make .
A dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased .
Seven golden talents to perfection wrought ,
To his good knight the strife that won the shield
Their ships our country 's fortune bore ;
And the shore lay under our lee ;
And it spoke the words which follow :
At arthur 's right , with smiling face arose ,
Though sad things stay and glad things fly ;
Corruption wins not more than honesty .
The evening poured on them its benison ,
And kullervo gave this answer :
And the little reeds sighed ` abide , abide ,
Her slumbers broke , the vision fled ;
Unwilling for a bungling hand to pass ,
Had passed into the silent life of prayer ,
Often treachery lurking lies
And how we set our hearts upon
Marked cities lost , and empires changed ,
Ever achilles showed us reverence -- yea ,
This counsel which i follow . no ,
The land was made resplendent with his train ,
To put thus far thy courage to the proof .
Deep on , the flow was heard and felt .
To joke with sorrow aching in his head ;
That england bore .
He sought his boyhood 's home . that hour
Bring me favor , mountain-woodlands ,
That come to test us and to strengthen us
Fountain of life that flows from out the sky ,
Would your eyes not follow me still through sleep
And guile is where it goes .
That the terrible boar made in his delicate skin ;
Though feathers hid her face .
That those soft fringes timidly should fall
And winter counts the ripened sheaves
Or if blind instinct ( which assumes the name
With which his church confronted him . to this
As a doubt that made him sleepless ,
As to their task the heroes turned .
May he who life and spirit gave
Is filled with sound , and launched in time ,
Deep in his breast my darts shall sink ,
So the angel of italy 's resurrection said ,
That never sailing on its waters saw
Like those short sweets here knit together .
" a weeping country joins a widow 's tear ,
You back him i n't and give him ease ,
And clothes to keep their bodies warm .
That power devoid of wisdom , can little earn .
Lover of peace , he looks beyond the strife ,
Has fallen on their heart , a heart so wise
Above her shook the starry lights :
With clouded looks , a pale assembly sate .
Made for this soul to move it ;
The fairest sight that cavern ever saw
Then turn away to peace . "
Because the times have hardly left them one tenant .
To close with all that makes him happy here .
And where'er my footsteps wander ,
And over ruined fields the storm hath come !
Gives even affliction a grace ,
Due worship ; raising , every dawn that came ,
Luring me by necromancy
And her thoughts turned fearfully
Boasts the hero , whom his prowess leads
That with their weight they make the balances
Which should make true lovers happy ;
Far his wanderings once bore him ,
And trace the wandering footsteps of my love .
It made the best mirror of majesty bleed ;
The woeful language all converted was .
The crooning turns to a sunrise singing .
Thus made reply : " he is indeed alive ,
She thought of theodore and the life they led ,
And so my gallant falcon breathed his last
Two thousand years degrade the grecian name ,
Know about lines laid across the big sea !
Who gently smiled and made reply :
At 's lost my heart , ye see :
Of passing beauty was the lady gay ,
And loose the anchor which the state maintains , --
I sing this song , borne all along
And feel a numbness creep upon his soul ,
Lest the deep stain it owns within
And fame shall spread the pleasing news below . "
Relates the chase , and early praise achieved .
The storm is coming on .
For him , when forth his chariot swept ,
Over the face of the leader came ;
The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned .
To make new captives , as forlorn .
Must wander thirty-fold for all the time
Had then been blotted from the book of fate .
Both were mine ! life went a-maying
And made such an ordinance ,
And death comes softly stealing on ,
Perchance among them shoots a lustrous flame
Let thy whole strength go to each ,
Like some black host the shadows fall ,
The flimsy leaves hang on the bright blue air
Love turns aside the balls that round me fly ,
And drunkenness of glory thus revealed .
Advancing age has wrought a piteous change
Her lips were fashioned to move joy or tears
Far up his joyful song he poured ,
Who with such splendor gave their youth away ;
Poured in a ceaseless shower , the weapons fly .
Their bristly foe sought refuge , where nor steed ,
Didst thou with impious war pursue the man
Let virtue teach thee firmly to pursue
Whose taint still tingled every breath ;
Till in his saddle he was set .
By love ’s absorbing might possessed .
Loud , deep , and lang the thunder bellowed :
The autumn passed away . the winter 's snows
And here and there two crystal mountains rise ,
Thou showest still thy perfect face of peace ,
It is december matched with may ,
Where darkness waits with wide , expectant lips ?
Should some mighty grief oppress her ,
Has the same verdant path pursued ,
The martial myrmidons confusedly stand .
It gains the opposing margent of the stream ,
So warm the haze that spreads o'er everything ;
That leapt in crimson o'er the abandoned hulk
Where shifting winds were driving his argosies ,
Where eloquence takes either side ?
Was spun this song that stills each listening leaf --
That a doubt will only come for a kiss ,
A glance exchanged , a smile , a fallen flower
That right eye which saw my heart blood sprinkled !
For then the feverish fret is gone
So psyche turn 'd to tread that desert black ,
A soothing murmur the lone region fills ,
Had got it barred an ' lockit .
A little yet his restless heart did move .
Our cause we have sought to promote ;
A trance wherein no thought finds speech or name ,
While day and night can bring delight ,
From imminent peril that before me stood ,
Just back a piece came the police ,
Slow on your dial the shadows creep ,
Death came mantling on his brow ,
Was that which to the church belongs ,
And fill your soul with christmas song
Creeps back to find the throbbing heart .
That leans upon our dead , the clod
Full in his face their wings expand .
Of pinched fanatics , who would rather choose
Then , follow nature ; and resemble god .
Crushed in the fall of what he cast away .
Next follow . every fern is tucked and set
The seasons must have turned
What hath he done ? what promise made ?
A bitter sigh i drew , then scarce found voice
His prospects clouded and his commerce spurn 'd --
' damsel , ye know this order lives to crush
Seeking new moods of life ,
The clouds are gathering everywhere
Certainly make you wish that you were dead ,
In shining draperies , headed like a star ,
Black , strangling trees , whispering obscene things
What mind could harbour the offence of such recollection ,
And heaven reclaims the soul it lent .
That when the body decays fame should also go
The wind , the tempest roaring high ,
Till the bait is gone from the crafty line ,
I feel thy arms about me ,
To thine embrace this joyful spirit moves
With such fell cruelty were seen , their goads
His weal in every labour sought ,
No eye can follow , to a fatal place
The gods let slip that fiendish grip
Lamenting , in the song that sorrow loves ,
Ha gave us all a good-by cheerily
And now the joss broke in with his song :
Benevolence came forth with speed ,
And crowds surged passionately to see him slain .
To tarry for them when the vow was made
As one might think a star that heavenward led .
Where a light has risen that can not wane ,
Are opened by a mortal 's kindly deed .
Now met himself . a flying shaft he sped
To lead our lives in righteousness ,
Who first ulysses ' wondrous bow shall bend ,
And give the greeting that i send .
Hollowed a little mournfully .
Where the dim-seen meadows lie ,
Beyond those ice-crowned citadels which stand
And down her visage tears of sorrow rolled ;
That the foe may catch despair
_ courage _ shall strengthen the weapons ye wield .
The devil below was ringing his knell .
The portals of salvation were opened to me ,
Some hidden sense pertaining to this tree .
To hear a sudden summons come ,
For fate admits my soul 's decree ,
Banners on high , and battles passed below ;
Thy thoughts belong to heaven and thee :
For the weaver winter its shroud had spun ;
So went i through the bitter and foul air ,
Than bride to robin hood . your plans are laid
And know enough to make one sick :
In each resides a secret power its own .
Having found vain the hope of reaching the fruit .
Yet wholly gave the father 's heart :
Ye roses bow your crimson heads ,
Where to form our ranks , and when ;
Though every day brings sorrow .
When firm by royalty stood ilium 's state --
Though tragic years clashed on the while ;
And public faction doubles private hate .
To find the regions destitute of day . "
The burn sings ae remembered name ,
I hold the universe . i count the stars .
The fulness of a heart too tense to break --
Has bid such strife depart .
Weeping i said : " the things that present were
And how may true tranquillity be found
Answer in the words which follow :
That from every part the bright blood flows ,
And with him comes november ,
We fell out , my wife and i ,
Thy welcome shall proclaim ,
Around his brows a golden cloud she spread ;
Which still shall run along the thread ,
For which my soul did pine :
But it is sad to read their fate ,
The heavy debt of vengeance paid -
Of yesterday and to-morrow take their way ,
To break my dream the vessel reached its bound :
A sudden cloud comes swimming o’er his eyes .
The home-pressed question of the age can find
Into these lovelier marble limbs it stole ,
The bane of sin rests on our race ,
Which many a leaf and blossom bore ,
Which seeing , she spoke courage to her soul ,
What coward looks forward and foresees defeat ?
We 'll taste the joys of life
And care comes on with time ,
I have shed sweat enough , left flesh and bone
Now puts a period to my pain .
The thrall in the darkness plunged with his knife ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies .
To rouse again its strength of dark unrest ;
There was a navy went into spain ,
And they met the boughs beneath :
I with my misery worn , and faint
And zephyrs stir the newly-opened leaves ;
On whom to ask blessings that come from above .
Fear to those sheets that know no sin .
Beauty 's rich bed of blushes lies .
Shall feel the hope , within his bosom dying ,
Glad winner , lead thy paragon apart !
Perhaps the battle will not go ,
And a little time passed over ,
That makes me so digress ?
The soul of ajax burn ’d above the rest .
Renown so got the prince esteemed naught :
What heaven has lent thee wilt thou freely give ,
That slew our sorrow and healed our care . "
The tent is struck , the vision stays ; --
The summer passed , the winter came ;
And caught its tone with death 's prophetic ear ;
Wherein grief his seat hath taken ,
His gospel message , and were turned to him ,
Childlike in all that makes a child so dear
And fear upon the immortals came .
Your eyes shine with a sweet delight
The sun slipped westward . that peculiar change
There to fill the stones with anguish ,
May turn to smiles in heaven .
In the strength the lord christ gave ,
My limbs new strength received , and vigor new .
The reeking shuttle lifeward wove ,
While life held such treasures for me ,
The foe is strong , and our defences slender ;
Of nothing more than having good years to spend ;
And the sea the yellow dunes caresses .
Shredded clouds are whirled in air ,
And the vapors that arise
To an old house that stood alone ,
And almost burst the barriers in their heat ,
The master reckoned him a fool ,
Might to some city lead the horse behind .
This plague to expiate and stay . ”
Whence its sense obtained the monster ?
Whom fragments feed with his chance charity .
Of thy sweet soul i form a part ,
Fast to love that falls off never
The veins creep , dying languidly
And they saw constant reason to rejoice
" and then my heart with pleasure fills ,
They in their mirrors show the mourning
Now awful beauty puts on all its arms ;
As faith can seal it you .
His resistless breath upheaved
The bladder bounced about me . what cared i ?
And tackled anything that came .
Before his tongue could make reply ,
That only serves to make us grieve ,
The tears blinded her e ' e.
She gave them soon to know where stood sublime
We will take a tour and see it ,
To meet misfortune 's , where it blends ,
Then the lightning flashed , and the thunder roared ,
There lies the battlefield
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall !
Through the air swift spirits pass ,
This thought of death come over me .
The moon gives you light ,
They stirred not , but conquered and died .
That 's sinking in despair ;
Wrung from the grasp of tyranny ,
And broadside blazing level with the wave
Whereon the moon fell suddenly south-west ,
And quivering heavenwards , lost himself in light .
A happier kingdom than i go to take .
Since first thy airy , circling course was run !
Its own desires , each latent wish that bears
Can lodge a heavenly mind -- demands a doubt .
Here lie the corn-fields with a gleam
She takes the welcome gift , for much she joys
Because thy name moves right in what they say .
I followed afterward the emperor conrad ,
An ' smooth her sides until they shine ,
Hold abeyance till the judgment .
More grateful than all tongues can tell .
That led you to the sea .
To find myself here , all alone ,
Open thy breast unto the truth that 's coming ,
" the hand that made us is divine ! "
Achieve thy destiny , seize thy fame --
Of justice doth run counter to the edge .
That bore commission 'd witchcraft thence ,
The throes with which her iron sinews heave --
Which the king himself to my keeping gave ,
Its worldly striving , its greed for gold ,
When rainy clouds about him cling .
And given her a fatherly greeting .
The soul found passage through the spouting veins .
Is the only sound that comes to me .
I know not what the future may hold ,
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
That made the lion servant of his will .
Half wished he 'd lost that early train !
“ far more than power of letters can convey .
My frightened soul no peace can find .
Thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie
Enter 'd , supporting all of autumn 's fruit
Till his pain the gray-beard banished ,
Seems struggling for her weary , panting breath !
And human hearts to feel for human woe .
In solemn silence swallowed ,
The shades of eve come slowly down ,
That send the spring thro ' leaf and spray :
I fell in love with laura lilly .
Even fear is afraid to tread :
Thrill for service to be stamped .
Admit no steel can hurt or wound thy side ,
Glory bursting o'er the skies ;
The winds of night came vigorous from the deep
And the peaks looked toward god alone .
The water dwells a multitude , whose sighs
And the black-robe chief made answer ,
When faith has at last united and bound them ,
With pride maternal beat her breast
Until he had got through .
That constance held affection to the veil ;
By the tears it has shed ;
For danger waits on all untimely joy .
And though it is filled with laughter ,
That wisdom infinite must form the best ,
But when with threats they both had whetted keen
Nor truth leave unaverred .
Of sire or uncle make his young heart glow
That made us , and for us this ample world
A war , where seas of blood may flow
When grateful birds prepare their thanks to pay ,
Of battle and lust were blown along the slope
And gave the pair a son . so ignorant still
Havoc fell of the foe he made ,
A wounded bird that peer 'd into thy face
Beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise .
These stormy gusts and winds waft precious ships ,
To the foil 'd searching of mortality ;
From whose branches trailed the mosses ,
Thick with sighs that shook the trembling air ,
The lion-haunted thickets hold apart .
Hearts to break but nane to sell ,
Until the contest found an end .
And we took the chance they gave
Upon his ears that heavenly music broke ,
The thorns that on thy brow they plied , --
From the soft wing of vernal breezes shed ,
The cloister 's silence found a tongue ,
And seals of glory stamped her queen ,
For in the chalice misery holds to life ,
O may no son the father 's honour stain ,
Each leading many a rescued soul ,
Whose soul is still prepared for death ,
To what i feel is lord of all ,
So his wife took care of this nice affair ,
That him of life bereft at once they bear
Thus change the forms of being . thus arise
“ our pastures , make the hair resemble gold .
His time observed ; for closed by foes around ,
All the town is set with stars ,
Comes the life of grief and pain .
And leaves of laurel bind the flowing hair .
As made my aspect fearful . all who saw ,
Now , while our soldiers are fighting our battles ,
Like flames upon an altar shine the sheaves ;
A storm is running on the wind --
Never a thought of the joys that flew by ;
Had drawn their armies near upon the hills
There the wild music rose and fell
To change your life , or else renew it ,
Till great alcides made the realms obey :
Rome in her ancient splendour proudly rose ,
Softened by itself to sadness : --
It is a bitter moment , when hearts ache ,
And offer grain that springs for us at will .
Through flesh and bone a way it found ,
Flags , flutter out upon turrets and towers !
Oft when the soul is lost in thoughtless guilt ,
( and yet the memory rankles ) ,
In the best blood that warms thy vein .
Is warring in that hateful helen 's cause :
But storms that fly ,
For spring shall return , and a lover bestow ,
An ' here , though storms outside may pelter
Another , with her maidens , drawing off
Who was suddenly seized with the plague ;
Of night and day over his spirit go ;
And kings the forehead on his threshold drew --
The mirth that shakes the beard of grain
Which way these took they pointed , and i went
Composed but shadowed , nature sits --
Song came out of me simple as breathing .
And melting virgins own their love .
Only made the fire burn brighter ,
't is long since storms have reached them .
There is mixed with it so much worldliness ,
Had gladly given thee comfort in thy work .
Slothful disorder filled his stable ,
With these last words a sigh that damsel drew ,
A slumberous silence fills the sky ,
Which rolled under the clouds into a gloom
And each chill insect sinks beneath the soil ;
Such prayer the people made ; then nestor shook
And all my heart within me lay
Put forth the sleeping strength that in thee lies ,
My former joys are pass 'd and gone ,
Oh , never from tongues of men have dropped
Touched by love 's magnet , hither often drew ;
The south wind woos the violet ,
So on they went -- the crowd believing --
Close in his london lodging lay concealed
On all around the infectious sorrow grows ;
To feed oblivion with decay of things ,
First a strong , clear faith to show ,
With white teeth flashing as they sing .
O could i here find my abode ,
Beyond the lonely ways , beyond the guiding star ,
No voice there came ; the vital flame
The slow clouds slowly drift and pass
What felt those poets but you feel the same ?
The doom that now hath fallen on thee ;
To bear a life so wasted and forlorn ?
His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely ,
The suns of twenty summers danced along , --
Not put it in so great a fright ,
Thick storms of steel from either army fly ,
Each morn a thousand volumes brings , you say ;
Those strangers bringing joy . they will not now .
And often quoted when the bowls go round .
Many are the hearts looking for the right ,
A couching lion lay .
Their ruined missions lie ,
In the sad marks of glory lost .
A languid hue the thirsty fields assume ,
But wretches meet , to wail and weep
Upward the soul forever turns her eyes ;
The mountain stream ran fresh and fair ,
Neither birds in air that flutter
The pleasant land of rest is spread
Of the bishops lead such shameful lives ,
And the crags where winds have blown --
And horror stilled the rising gale .
To seek some other rest must be thine aim ,
Our drooping fortunes to be mounted higher ,
And close around them baying , held aloof .
The virtue of the good is shown .
But favor for euryalus appears ;
The leaves to let it wander in .
Behold where the red dawn is breaking !
Lit by the sun , where winds unfurled
Like parting friends that linger as they go .
Or hate those pleasures that to youth belong ,
Of the great shield , wherein the lion lies
That would make fast our bonds again .
Italian license loves to leap the pale ,
Death at his portal came to knock ,
The trees make song ,
Is fit to harbour for the worth it holds .
Dimly i catch the throb of distant flails ;
Came shrieking hideous ; me pale horror seized ,
Through all the old romance began to roam ,
The rough river ran --
And he was moved by all that loveliness
Wild blossoms , spread their tinctured sails .
We are uplifted till we touch a star .
Not such the boon that brahmá gave .
Then rain and darkness on them drew .
And to bring me glimpses of times to be
To whistle contentment back again
A writing , as he went ;
Joy stills the shout that might insult the brave ;
The bells made happy carolings ,
That turns earth 's smoothness rough ,
That hid thy starry spirit ,
May days of winter come with speed ,
The eastland wind blew shrill and snell ,
Above the painter 's dream he set her face ,
More softly than the dew is shed ,
Feeling its life-strings crack ,
As far as they by sight can followed be ,
He made his tunes , he played about
The flowers came hurrying up so sweet --
When he gave me his ring and his name ,
And we the pieces on it deftly laid ?
Into your chests , drawn by your painful thumb .
Were once thy starry nature given to mine ,
The powers of health and nature when combined .
Coarse and hard thy saviour lay ,
And how they might have borne more welcome news .
Plunging the brand in my own misery .
Where nature with a golden chain hath bound ,
That , happy frailties to all ranks applied ,
Oh give me leave to part from thee ,
And asks for blessings from the lord ,
The tears they waken long remain .
Where god can look into my heart 's own heart
Where innocence again fell prey to hate ?
And mighty sums he saw the work would ask .
Of flowers that never wither . so they pass
Content to leave behind all worldly strife .
The maze of stars that only death may free --
Now vanish all remembrance of the day ,
So centuries came , and centuries went ,
A mist before his vision hangs ;
From it arose mists growing into mists
Of manhood to the scaffold led ,
And his who gave them breath but higher sung ,
What wealth the show to me had brought :
Would she soon rise to eminent estate ?
These sentiments were heard to pass .
Lest to the foe our counsel be revealed . "
And set him chief in honour at the feast ,
And now she gives a cry of fear ,
What wealth the show to me had brought :
As of contending chaos come again ,
Reared in schools of self-denial ,
For of a righteous will his own is made .
How came it we every one heard with amaze ,
Where the salt weed sways in the stream ;
Which yet join not scent to hue ,
It lifts , it bears my happy soul ,
And in her old bounds buried her despair ,
What more than madness has possess 'd your brains ?
Given all the gold that all the seasons wear
He seized the time to awe the eastern world ,
A portion of the entrails , next , he set
Have risen indeed to conflict for the ships ,
No , no ; this sorrow shown
Thy rage provoked who soothed with gentle rhymes ? "
Choice of the nymphs whose looks will slant
In shafts that reach the level of the plain .
It moves me for the moment , and i think
What region held his ancestors , what clouds ,
The dame herself -- the goddess well express 'd ,
That holds yon crazed monk in thrall ? "
In things a moderation keep :
And i feel the cold night-air .
Spectres came dancing up the wind ,
About him made a bulwark of bodies slain ,
And the old forgotten empires , which have faded turn
With all to which hope can cling .
Filling all my soul with joy ,
Of waves that drive to shore ,
And , when the moon went up the sky ,
To render thee thy liberty and fame . '
I feel ashamed to kneel and pray .
Be virtuous and life will pass
( red rose leaves will never make wine . )
Thine image caught and mirrored in our thought !
The chimney keeps , and sits content within ;
I set me there to practise barratry ,
The wife , the girls and kris took fire ;
The threshold , fame declares the pillars shook ;
Although it makes our heart-strings quiver ,
A hopeless hate that can not stir ,
And sends a comfortable heat from farr ,
Is , as in mockery , set ' --
Then care and doubt were fled ;
To lift their breasts with longing , any lips
Of breathing and see how you cripple talent ,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide ,
Here mighty ister pushes to the main ,
One evening , as he framed the careless rhyme ,
And step by step they followed dancing ,
That fell all round about her there .
" splendour eternal , piercing through these folds ,
But god must place his hand upon each heart ,
Comes help , given or taken ; so with me
That man is whelmed by deadly night ,
Yielding the life . and into the city poured
The truth i gave in exchange for a lie ,
The dawning light begins to shed ,
Arrows fall thick : the warriors press forward .
Are lost when touched , and turned to pain ;
As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass ,
Whom hate or other springs of strife inspire ,
His summum bonum reaches ,
And that will bring him to disgrace ;
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears .
Hot from his mouth came fire and smoke ,
Now moved with pity : even as sometimes nods
At day-fall oft will run ,
With banners on the roofs that played .
The glory from his gray hairs gone
When need or sorrow came , than she ,
By nations which the roman empire broke ,
For ever opened through his life in death ;
The affluent foliage of its branches made
Yet so gave each his measure running o'er ,
Which , laying strong hold on universal laws ,
The stations of my course should rise unsought ,
And trembling lips found voice to cry :
Informs him now and gave him birth .
This morning the parson takes a drive .
The clouds are marching slow .
We set our watches , regard the time .
Like airs that breathe from paradise
For thou hast raised me from the common earth .
And the wind rings them like little bells .
The wind sprang up in the tree-tops
That brought me in to thee ,
Cut from the root my perished joys i see ,
And let my fire of wrath consume the world .
The wild birds sang where her heart was laid ,
That shakes the shutter , to have brought to mind
To ampler fates that leads ?
" life offers -- to deny ! "
A sacrifice is of this treasure made ,
To the cards and dice that he did run .
For quick he knew , with anger fired ,
Or ere the ecstatic impulse go ,
For tranquil nature owns no mourning flower .
In unremorseful folds of rolling fire .
And smooths the bed of death . ”
Divided , feels the chilling air .
So turn our hearts as on we rove ,
God fashioned them as you see ,
Which made the cross the symbol of the sword ,
When we are _ dead _ the recollection stays
The wind goes shivering with cold
While he who made the lowest score
Which even now set all my mind ablaze
To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon .
But man 's faded glory what change shall renew ?
As the clouds are swept from heaven ,
He who at court is held in sovereign grace ,
And every flower that sad embroidery wears ;
And brook and limpid rill that made
Who made thy foot firm on the necks of kings
Shall dim their eyes with tears !
The noose that swung !
And add to wine the luxury of verse .
That floated nearer , until pomp and pride ,
While fury made his eyeballs red ,
A cracked voice broke upon my pityings :
The least force shakes , but none removes .
In fortune and in name we 're bound
Peace on the world is laid .
So that would make you happy : furthermore ,
But soon her brother filled the throne of tyre ,
To fill the black bull 's horns with mead
To try to feel is but to court despair ,
Pray , moses , give calhoun the wink ,
Of her chastity made a scorn :
Just as i go to sleep and dream .
Had filled all her being with joy
Let the wither 'd branch for itself take heed ,
His song brought love as april brings the bird ,
Whom , not till seventy years had sped ,
Swift at the word the gallant lusians bound ,
And set the sharp wings forward like a boat
And all found wanting -- and i was afraid
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place ,
Peace that the world nor gives nor takes away !
Then in graves with roses blown ,
That dims the greying end of night ;
To-day no fragrance falls nor summer air ,
Of that was doubt and disputation raised .
His pleasant robes and crowns he takes again .
And mirth flowed like the wine ,
Life owns no joy like thine !
If the garden had merely held birds and flowers !
That the house perish when the soul doth pine .
And pride bestowed on all , a common friend ;
And away it proceeds ,
Attracts them , follow ) , might ascend thus far
Strikes the great forest white with fear ,
The great strong river swept around ,
All find it so who wedded are ,
Then round the circle went their flight ,
Away to the west as the sun went down ;
Whose windows and retiring aisles reflect
Still will my hopes pursue thee ;
Command , and any sacrifice i 'll make ;
_ on first looking into chapman 's homer . _
And wealth beside i give thee : speak ,
The print of beauty 's foot was set ,
Of nature it came to pass that iron can be
And give back sunshine with an added glow ,
Our foreheads both sprinkled in liberty 's name ,
The man was moved , and silence fell again ;
The _ other _ dream ran fast and free ,
Eftsoones be took them twain ,
To hit the sense of human sight .
With platitude for kindness shown
Herod 's suspition may heale his .
She in her coach which two old serpents drew ,
The hoary willows waving with the wind . ]
Light as the gossamer its tissue spins
Quite flabbergash 'd , ye see :
The selfish heart deserves the pain it feels ;
Its ruddy rich delights , and winds blew high ,
Could not make the iron harden .
In leading its young spirit up to god .
To drawen folk to heaven , with fairness ,
Alas ! the period of adolescence reaches home . the
That spun the thread of life , give heed :
And in the dawn they floated on ,
And oft together led to seek god 's ways .
Torn by his frozen body 's lust for heat ,
And thou remainest , dimly feeling pain ,
What stirs the funeral pall ?
No answer could the astonished mother make ;
The briton too puts on a cheery face ,
I even find a charm in this ,
And his grave has got no name .
The little hills and mountains flew
_ which never shall close again
And , cautiously feeling each step o'er the ground
But we are following them toward the dawn ,
That holds my love from me .
My heart an echo caught --
And papa has made the offer ,
I turn to a sister of sainted cecilia ,
Of passion still , -- and still it clung
To give her the kindest greetings ,
Hard his breath came through his nostrils ,
She knows not what her tongue has spoke ;
Thy mortal passage when it comes . ascend
That law has licensed , as makes temperance reel .
Then did my leader lay his grasp upon me ,
For all thy goodness hath bestowed ,
And naked branches point to frozen skies , --
The child will weep in the cradle that lies .
Till came its severance self-entailed ,
Thought his doom had come upon him ,
The last deal ended the game , i saw
Now do i mount a billowy cloud ,
The flowers bloom where once did run a tide
As struck with shame , their desperate grasp ,
War winds her horn , and giant cliffs go down
And froze the genial current of the soul .
Has not a noble mind found long ago
The words are utter 'd , and they flee .
A thousand woes , a thousand toils remain .
And drops its load .
Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand .
Now these , the songs , remain to eternity ,
Ambrosial , searching , yet retiring , mild :
That crying makes it stop .
Tears -- amidst thy laughter seen ,
And hands to make his hands rejoice ,
When daylight is gone and darkness brings dread ,
Till from your brow you chase that frown ,
And gave to joan a courteous hug ,
Poured from his bosom , and the long sobs told
The strong doors split asunder , pouring in
Plough thou the rock until it bear ;
-- then steal away , give little warning ,
By reason 's censure coldly o'er me cast ,
' but quickly on this side the verdict went ;
Hope is flown -- away disguises
And the old priest put out the waning fires
Whose broken arms portray hell 's lust ,
For hers was the story that blotted the leaves .
Shall swell the pride of those who can
Himself to sing , and build the lofty rhyme .
That came to swell love 's welcoming song -
And there fell joy upon the gods to hear .
Those few they find awake first meet their fate ;
But still too bitter to be borne
His cutlass made a wheel of flame .
The silver eel , in shining volumes rolled ,
He turned an eager glance towards the sea ,
And make report of what they hence descry .
Macdonough leads his gallant train ,
Where wild winds ever blow ;
Mark , where ambition leads the adverse band ,
Are they drunk , or grown weary of worship and
Its deep foundations lay .
Their comrades sweet have buried to the curls .
She makes her ears his cells for honeyed speech ;
The western tide crept up along the sand ,
And after april , when may follows ,
Forget the life that their wild brother leads .
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
And gaiety supplies the place of sense ,
Like pebbles rough , much friction find ;
And read the authentic message of his eyes .
Will rise in each eye ,
Life with red wine his golden chalice fills ,
Porphyry mounts where crystals glare --
Which has just dropped down from heaven ,
But see that time is breaking faith with me .
Thus unto himself reflected :
Charms from the charmer , yet some never grow
Yon field that gives the harvest , where the plough
Glow in the sunset flushed with glorious flame .
These words to raghu ’s son addressed :
The love to things unborn is given ,
The tailors too have got commands
Each heart recalled a different name ,
She clapped her hands , flushed joyous hues ;
To gentle ways i am inclined ;
The smoke of hostile cannon lies his way ;
Straightway thou must rise from slumber ,
What new power now plies the shuttle ? '
As if joy helped you all the way ,
Of this distress , and made me break those laws
The sweetest guest that courts humanity ;
I dreamt not life could hold
Was lost in the balmy air .
And i would have given my soul for this
Now never more may spring and autumn meet .
As you blow through apple blossoms ....
Misery and anguish rising
Alone ! the shuddering echo dies away ;
None could make our friendship wither . '
The shining history that you are gone to make ,
A tiny cloud of rosy color lies ;
Only by love is life made real ;
Better if on a rising ground it stood ,
And all the peers , dismissed , withdrew .
I drew ulysses from his wandering way
Throughout gave such devotion , constant thought ,
The mighty will of fate confessed ,
From hearts whose prayers watched o'er us .
And art thou fitted to adore ,
Of such commotion , such as to set forth
And the garden surged into harmony ;
A blast of fiery desert wind that dried ,
Like him my truth will shine ,
His changing face , what pen can draw --
For whatever fortune brings ;
Where all the banners of her soul were flown ,
That 's how the little black devil was made .
" when the evening star brings darkness ,
" nor blunt your blades with massacre so mean ;
For what the world holds fair ;
Who challenged what god spent his genius on ,
Who trod the pure soul of another
" chiampa there her fragrant coast extends ,
A tiny bird flits through the twilight brown ,
The lamb of god who takes away our sins .
She wrought on him to do her evil will .
The hissing blow-fly seeks his love ,
Your voices sing through the christmas-tide ,
That seem too heavy for tremulous water to hold .
That , as his early mind was taught , }
Came the dark wind of evening silver-starred --
Can you burn up the rapture of kisses
Of silken lists that ramble into her ,
I could not feel a pain .
And now his city strikes the monarch 's eyes ,
There lies no desert in the land of life ,
The untroubled eyes that mirrored thine ,
There stood _ romance _ ,
And noble grief sought arms were hid from her :
No word from him . the war rolled back ,
That to serendib the same forms belong --
And through her blood the lightning ran .
The far , the great guns shake .
In sin for ever lost from life ; this act
Noting the visages of some , who lay
Or that the place was made for misery ;
Darker and darker the cold clouds are sailing ,
And dying leaves that wavering fall ,
Which hides a loving english heart .
Majestic she shall take the chanted way ,
Whose light shines brighter here .
" of crackling laurel , which foresounds
There comes a reverence for all thy kind ,
Let 's see what evils threat the next campaign ,
O heart of youth that wakes and sings !
The life goes out , how many things result ?
That shield he bore before him ; firmly grasp 'd
I have heard that there lies a land far hence
Was velvet blue , and trapped with gold .
Melodious murmurs , warbling tune his praise .
And feels the soft anxiety she gave .
The emperor who left his french in trust
And swelled his bulk with martial pride .
Yet her tears shine with laughter ,
The seventh statue , poured the yellow galls ,
Where peace has filled the hearing of thy sons :
I trod the path of duty where it led ,
Bright eyes encounter 'd duty ,
With every joy and rapture fired ,
Then let my wife grind unto another .
And each reflects a kindlier day ;
Each gravestone holds to heaven a patient cross .
Would be put in immortal rhyme .
And grief destroy what time awhile would spare . "
Come , when his task of fame is wrought --
At length his career found a close in death ,
Still on the chords , her lute laid by ,
That darkened his life and threatened his reason ,
And to and fro the tidings run ,
Nor all the reek of erebus to dim .
He speaks as straight as his rifles shot ,
And as i gaze it comes to mind --
And turn 'd our heaven to hell ?
The arrow of my soul which i have shot
The only bond i hold you to
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
And of this baba willingly took note ,
His forty days ' provision bore ,
The sunlight from her cymbals played
Mankind to win , wooing while hope remains .
And by all means for his deliverance meet ,
Souls seeming to return unto the stars ,
In joy , that memory lived within his life :
Can gold grow worthless that has stood the touch ?
On the first text heard spiritually ,
I leant upon his music as a theme ,
He makes for the lands of wonder .
Of thistle-seeds that wait a travelling wind .
Usurping treason seized the civic helm ,
Triumph , and thoughts no bondage can restrain .
Weary hearts by thee are lifted ,
It raves , made hoarse with desire ,
That drinks the greenness from the ground ,
The happiest heart that ever beat
Bright pictures of profit delighting to draw ,
She kindles the desire
Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw ,
The pious memory stay 'd the lifted arm ;
Break the night 's stillness , then go far around
Asteropaeus kindled at the sound ,
Where was the motor that made it go
It emptied the bar of the king of spain .
Ruth 's young feet went to and fro ,
Thoughts that breathe , and words that burn .
With the light her heart would pour ,
The hills that have for ages stood ,
Virtue sprung up like daisies from the sod .
Where they stood thirty and three .
As in some sort is found we being awake .
His own magic art hath wrought ,
It breathes around thee in the air ,
Or favor gave or sought .
The church its cherished union found ,
For having lost but once your prime ,
Alluring , swelled with love and weighted down
Wilt thou that this hostility proceed ,
Through bones and veins there went a deadly chill ;
The red dreams come
And kneeling whisper , _ whence comes peace ? _
Gaze with their human eyes . here grow the lines
By mary 's hand at eve was spread .
An angel bends from every cloud that rolls ;
In bitter words that pierced and stung
And robin 's cheerful tenor cried ,
Juno then took up the word and said :
Superfluous matter came , shot out in ears
And left me comfortless . no load i bear
Would rise to atoms ; then as an atom resting
As if a great bible , bound in lead ,
These contraries such unity do hold ,
Of all that it contains . the following heaven ,
And autumn 's breath has blown
The flame of purest friendship rising still :
But guile may kill the wondrous man ;
As in low murmur moved her thoughts aloud , --
Told where the midnight tempest came ,
He passed away . him followed then
In tranquil peace of mind to take and know
His craftsman 's instinct knows .
And eager purchasers drew nigh
Through the dense wood that round them lay ,
To feverish life , feeling the poisonous smart
To me he made reply .
The desert sands had hid a thousand years ,
Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes ,
And coming events cast their shadows before .
The red leaves fall upon the mould ,
To his dying mate went he :
A rare and undistinguish 'd fragrance made .
Sounded aloud . the peal it blew had made
That angela gives promise she will do
The homeless hobo 's footsteps stray .
But still the stealthy fungus grew .
I gave my second tears ,
Whose courtly robes yet bear no wilful stain !
My breath caught , i lurched forward --
The gloom and coolness of declining day .
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;
Repentance had won a last grace ,
Which from her eyes into her bosom flows ,
Unto these words , these precious words attend :
And his empire melted away in flame :
Full canvas , head to wind !
That some new day may breed the best
That made the breeze to blow !
And briefly to the gods addressed his prayer ,
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss ;
The kisses that make my life ,
The river swept towards the sea --
We waft goodwill to every sphere .
That came last night
These quiet lakes , these stretched dreaming fields ,
Our love shall live , and later life renew .
Each bosom rebounded with youthful delight ,
Over them a serpent coiled about his head .
To swear with her who made the offer .
She pauses to tread out the fires
The name , that springs forever in my breast .
Within the crystal , which records the name ,
Troubling old ghostly gardens where it goes ,
Now love and hate in turn one sees ;
Turned southward from the blast , to face the suns
And dusky night puts on the garb of morn ,
The hay-sweet heat that soaked the skies !
Fair houses reared their stately height
Her look it charms , her love it warms ,
For all my heart leaps up to greet
The answer on answer that following came .
" and at last when death draws near you ,
If my lips speak fact or fiction . "
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
The screaming legions wheel , and mount the wind :
A little over us his station took .
And then the voice of blame found vent ,
Must that face be which such a shadow casts ?
The chapters holding peaks to scale ,
With ev'ry deal his fate has planned
And those of sorrows yet to come .
Until as much time as he lived be passed ,
Her skill and courage won her widespread fame ,
Which a man who was really a carpenter made .
Of giant races vanish 'd since the ark
Where hearts confusedly stray ;
Because they have made so good a friend .
Companioned by the sweetest , ay renewed ,
Light have ye still to follow evil or good ,
Slow time a sad nepenthe brought ,
In fight could stand against him , nor in games
Now felt as a flame , now at leisure
Fought we with michael , drove the dragon , he
Count every drop that the wide ocean fills ,
That voice which rises unto god ,
Truth led me to the present view , --
Her soldier , closing with the foe ,
All the water flushed with crimson !
Where merchants ’ shops their wealth displayed ,
Still lifeless lies and comes to naught .
Her breast and arms that ply
Fain would cast off hope and fear ,
This book assumes may justlier claim .
To save his followers ; blinded by his rage ,
Required a drug to save her life .
Coarse and hard thy saviour lay ,
Do make mine old joy come anew .
And not a rent made by the gale !
Flame and shot tore away all the tender wood ,
The tents of rhesus next his grief renew ,
Till brooms fade softly into stars --
And the clouds scarce show the sun
Another mother gives him birth .
And ill could be pronounced to stand or flow ,
No two of earth ’s degenerate sons could raise .
Extremes of hardship learn to bear ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
Which once corrupted takes the worser part ;
On earth he came to raise mankind to heaven .
In the ashen sombre atmosphere that lingers everywhere .
The young wife counted anxiously ,
I cherish his because in me it bides :
Out of the night that covers me ,
For pity let a tear be shed ;
Found the remedy of ukko ,
Praising fair summer that too soon is gone ,
Let us meet the fire of their guns
Such eyes hold fiery , earnest men
The gray church stands with stooping knees ,
Whose iron clasp he always felt ,
The eagle that left his plumes upon the car ,
Thy favour only crowns the full delight .
Through fire and flood this book has passed . --
Bearing out the last poor king .
Would more than paint an indian tyrant 's sway :
And fate will use a running noose
Some youthful grace that age would gladly keep ,
And the snow it nips so cold :
His hands together , and lamenting cried :
With eyes that burned , impatient to be gone .
And it makes the spirit within him stir
The pestilence that walks by night ,
And all his strength possessing unimpair 'd .
And their legions no longer were headed by ross !
But it was parted in singing ,
A goodly day to give thee bliss .
Whose new love bade all men share
Engenders shapes , and diversely brings back
Freedom gained yesterday is no more ours ;
Leaving at last not much besides chronology ,
And scatters death around from both her eyes ,
That made earth beautiful ... brave souls that spent
And then come fifty , and fifty-five .
Our love to him by this act is expressed ,
All nature is bathed in tears ,
With fires that nothing can quench or tame .
Perchance among them shoots a lustrous flame
If it flow from childlike hearts .
Looking to far off and celestial things . "
High as a cloud that brings the rain ,
Their lovesome labours laid away ,
Let him shed in free flight his rainbow light ,
Was lost in higher yearnings .
Wrinkles with years , nor yet the frame exhausts
To ráma thus his answer made :
Which made the young man bend his bow ,
When hearts unite their vows to pay
With breath from the censer of heaven sent ,
Whose tangled branches intercept heaven 's light :
All night he fought for air :
He took that proffered counsel and that way ,
Dread of the worlds , unused to spare .
A lovely stranger ; it has grown a friend .
Little canst thou , whose creed around thee hangs
But never before have felt the truth of this .
The silver fountains sing for ever . far
And the clear water of the stream ran off
Far off at sea one vessel lifts a sail ,
And filled with mortal fear the aged wooer !
By jordan 's stream , descended from the sky ,
And the landlord came for his regular rent .
High confidence in her whose aid is lent
When summer twilight lingers long ,
That dies with failure written on its face .
The tall corn-tassels lift their fragrant spires ;
To win new victories for the age to come .
From such sweet views to draw poetic fire .
Hath left to thir disputes , perhaps to move
Desire of action , bringing pain ,
The trampled steel that springs ;
Idly diffused among the winds . a part ,
You must take care and chuse your time
Now , peter ! take advice from doctor rush ;
Another rock will yield you passage safe .
Those words of cyrus , which he made to stand
Storms of despair my boat will overblow .
Dead with the folly youth 's crude fancies bore ,
The pleasures of living you sure should share , --
To thee , my farewell greetings say !
" our throne 's usurper doth arise :
When it babbles of gold and fame ,
That drank the fire of the sun :
Have made lands where their fancies dwell
Or sadly told how many hopes lie here !
My heart is weary , my peace is gone ,
The anthems of music delightful may roll ,
I heard cold words ; then came a swift eclipse
Deep silence hung round him ; the misty light
And h. g. wells has found that children play ,
The wind comes stealing o'er the grass
" when mornin ' cum , i took a good
Of this new master , hovering above the schools
Let 's give to her a chaste embrace ,
’ twas she alone attention paid .
Blank white faces floated back
Who turn the good to evil ,
Tears standing in their eye ,
It may make his fond heart beat .
In love , that never nil recovered be ,
Which lived but to reflect her loveliness .
And god sends pain ,
Do i make of this my life-task
Of clashing colors all her moods are spun --
Many upon thy death have ditties made ;
The soul bears poetry 's bud and flower .
Raise clear eyes to the struggle that must come ,
And added length to solemn sounds ,
There came an end to break the spell ;
The arms that would embrace her clasp the void
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame ,
We thought that love could never change .
Till from the few their plunder falls
Thus reaching soon the spacious camp of greece ,
Fold in the blessings that your hands enclose .
This drains the world , and leaves but weariness ,
For , soon as summer south-winds blew ,
Who in thy body holds his joyous seat .
O god , that made all creature ,
With smiling lips and eyes that shine ,
The moon has taken the lotus on his lap !
And no strength of arm will force them . "
And give a heart to france !
" holding malice like the puppies ,
The jovial god has left no room for cares .
Pain , poverty , and death , and madness came
The weeds pursue , with shouting scare the birds ,
To fix by painting 's rainbow hues .
To eyes yet dim with tears of earthly care ,
And spread the truth from pole to pole .
Who of our army systems made a route --
His desolating privilege , and stands
From what once lovely lip it springs unseen !
And christmas now was drawing near .
So mine eye follows thee , my sunflower ,
And foaming brown , with doubled speed ,
I have shed sweat enough , left flesh and bone
Bearing a lifelong hunger in his heart .
That will take her to her resting ,
But that decline but serves to mark
A hope so idle never touch 'd his brain :
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high . '
As there in happy indolence they lay
A chilled or burning heart behind : --
The live confession came , like rich perfume
Thou wilt recall this pause of rest ,
A footstep seem 'd to fall beside her path ,
In battle ’s front lay drenched in gore .
Which prompted horrors not to be expressed :
Would fill , or desolate my life .
That made harald with fury storm ,
I hear each voice go past .
How they ring out their delight !
Whose bonnets touch the firmament ,
Set the traveller on his way ,
And a light wind arose and blew these off ,
The god of ocean , fired with stern disdain ,
Whence the million stars were strown ,
Her face the angels marked with awe ;
Touched by some few moons first the darkling goal
Sweet sorceress , resolve my fears !
Chattering and chuckling as it goes --
All in the grace of beauty found ,
Tall trees that loads of blossom bore .
And coals that burned like love aglow .
When the heart hath hopes and fears ,
Which a grove of myrtles made ,
In this faith i rest secure ;
And on my bruised spirit fell
More grave and noble than it ever saw .
Ever raised in charity ,
Truth is ever to be found ?
Now dimmed and gone ,
Its fresh leaves whisper in a song
Into hoarse fury , till the shower set free
And take advice from me .
Was finer gold than any goose can lay ;
Was torn from peaceful winds and flung again
Then , bolder grown , with mute amaze
Still peopling each mansion with lodgers ethereal ,
" from thankless spite no bounty can secure ;
Her doubts are when the daylight goes ,
The sacred flood that rolls on golden sands ;
Sweet stream , that winds through yonder glade
Now torn and blackened by the fight .
Came chains ? came death ? the strain he blew
Slinks with his traitor where the shadows lie .
Which lay so heavy on my heart .
And the surge went over them .
Now reddening from the dawn , the morning ray
His host : and forth , as sunrise led ,
Freedom 's sword will strongly draw ,
The right thing to extinguish lust !
What scenes from wilkie 's pencil sprung ,
Let thy pleasant warmth surround me ,
While the horizon holds the day imprisoned . "
Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns ;
Which when the monarch reached , nigh overborne
Fearful they 'd turn his ignorance to jest .
But i suspect my skill , though they commend .
A love that melts pure gold , and gives
The world with hands raised , evil to destroy ,
Erewhile the mountain gave , and why together
Once more renew those lays that gave delight ,
And find them _ ripe for a revolt _ .
" there could to earth some power be brought ,
And brought forth a spirit that spoke to us
The grief that mortals can express ,
And the dish ran away with the spoon .
The hand o ' god hung heavy here ,
But as it passed away there followed after
Bearing to heaven that precious sigh
The sunnier spot allured the trailing vine .
Though men may load their names with guilt ,
No less a friend to government -- he held ,
Behind the sea cut off retreat ;
His face bowed low to weep the end
To minos down he bore me , and the judge
Oft in life saw this umbrageous elm ,
Is founded every virtue , came to thee . "
The wrath that to its depth his being stirred .
To build a kingdom or state ,
And think , that goal of glory won .
In joyous dance these country folk did pass ,
Each soul expands , each grateful bosom burns ,
A wan smile crept across the weary face
The very trees were stripped and bare ;
In hollow murmurs died away .
And , while the mortal mist is gathering , draws
The morning came , and not one guiding ray
The life that lives in thee !
Come hither my muse and give me a start ,
And found she could not spell .
And the storm has ceased to blow .
The summit won , i could no further go ;
The year is rounding full at last .
And join the mimic train of merry carnival .
And now the joss broke in with his song :
That laughter ! and then the children caught it ;
Courtesy , proffered aid . with pride inflate
The place assigned to end their discord fell :
Then bright gandharvas met his view ,
" now every hope is gone ! "
Weak and morose the moon hung , sickly gray ;
All trust that god will make the treason clear ,
Who yield their hearts to their maker , true ,
That hung and beamed with blossom and with bud ,
The saviour 's loving heart is touched ;
I left this vale of tears to gain repose ,
And many lakes , whose bosoms never stirred
Tears fell when thou wert dying ,
Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway ,
Can ye beat off one wave with prayer ,
The kindest may be taken as a test .
Not caesar , when he pass 'd the rhine ,
To guard the weak from wrong .
And who has brought their naked beauty
Not a sword to threaten slaughter ,
He burns , he stiffens with collected ire ,
For all the love that she has given ;
Who bears eternal summer in his soul .
That watched to ease the burden of the world ,
Thy altars stand , perfumed with native flowers !
The war is ended , is gone by ! "
Or dormice , overcome with slumber , lie .
And here and there pursue their devious course :
That lent my knee desire to kneel , and shook
Immense , deals round . now whilst the victor stands
With sunburned summer to respire .
Could give me ties of family and home ;
The cruel foe , that captive led
And they made her hair of gloomy
Mary blushed , and tried to turn the conversation .
The fountains tall to sob with ecstasy .
And first an angry glance on both he cast ;
They grew in beauty side by side
Calm , how calm on all things lies !
And feeble in its wasted grace it lies ,
Each wavering thought that rose from day to day .
Shall to-morrow find its place .
Lost in this pleasing ecstasy ,
As wraps the future , and no prayer may bring
But , while constrained to hold even union less
Where never plummet reached . and thou shalt sleep
The promise april surely had revealed
" such sacrifices shalt thou bring ;
Whom physic , i find , always makes melancholy ,
The figure which the spirit lost , its skin
Life in thy presence were a thing to keep ,
It came with heavy auguries
Give to thy ruder mirth his foolish beard ?
And every thing its course will run .
To hear the jests they made ;
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
It was not rome that tried to murder truth ;
" with tears they are not flowing .
With tears ascended from the heart 's sad sea ,
For days the fleet had drifted down the river ,
For rotting wood a use is found ,
With wild despair 's reverted eye ,
That made his sword to rattle .
Then tumult rose : fierce rage and pale affright
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
And the clouds are flying before the wind ,
Comes a pause in the day 's occupations ,
From breaking through the clouds with hideous clap ?
And all the world lies yearning
I always take cold , only wetting my feet ;
To write them eagles might their plumage give ,
Forward press the mrljashevich warriors ,
But ere a long and oily speech had closed ,
The wind , that gives the rose a kiss
The flies blur sudden blasts of shine ,
To-morrow , night will come again ,
In that they were reserved for such a woe ;
This call sings low of wonder-worlds .
" your fame already these our regions own ,
By sudden death to give me ease ;
But the eternal will says otherwise .
That stands in the garden of mystery
A wondrous lot of change will bring :
The wind whereon its petals shall be laid .
A world made out of more that has a reason
The measure of his strength , his spirit gives .
Drive away these fell diseases ,
There the seed took root and flourished ,
They floated away , torn and drowning .
In moonlit splendor rests the sea ,
At length the general dread has shared ,
Not this way can her sadness leave her .
The leaden thunders crashed .
Anticipation forward points the view .
And how contending passions urge mankind :
Then why does anguish wring his brow
No word came with our coming , to remind us
Over the clear red roofs they flow and pass .
Where jove and saturn thunder-crested , led
And purpose strong woke in her heart ,
Or what does he regard his single woes ?
They lift their silent fingers to our years ,
Of all its burdens stripped it bare
A lofty fabric does the sight invade ,
Not by the grief that stuns and overwhelms
There is no burden but should lightly lie ,
Sublimer treasures than old greece displayed .
And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament .
Ask what prevailing , pleasing power
To the love that keeps it living .
In liberal actions new-york stands alone .
Should drift across my heart while joysome memories rise
Then nature 's language reaches to the heart ,
He bears a moral coat of mail ,
When his heart is breaking all the while .
Which on her other beam the vessel plied :
The soul has closed in deadly fight
And lies to hide it , makes it two .
Hath take hire into compaignie .
The eastern sky was left to dusky grey ,
Pupil of christ , he disciplined her mind .
Then to the ball his horny foot applies ,
But while the surf they tumbled through ,
We found another huger and more dread .
Methinks good music is wine turned to sound .
Here as he seeks to quench his burning thirst ,
-- on his official duties bound ,
The river rolled in shade between .
Though tenderest bonds may bind us to it !
Sad memory with thy songs to interfuse ?
And vulcan , wise to execute all tasks
Dim the sweet look that nature wears .
Their gates wide open threw .
A lambent flame arose , which gently spread
First normandy , in his demand he makes ,
A tower of strength you show to all
Unswerving to the finish , and he gave
Obeyed the vow which hermits take ,
The old year 's gone away
Could she not live who life eternal gave ?
And he spake the words that follow :
The long afternoon went by at last , and evening
It sings the blessed song of peace ! "
My thoughts ran into harmonies ,
And those to virtuous thoughts inclined
Now he thinks he 'll go to sleep !
The hollow winds the gliding sighs convey 'd .
My soul could straightway tremble face to face
Though mourning friends shed cataracts of tears .
For land that drops the rosy day
Comes a voice all clamorous with despair ;
The smile -- where hath it wandered ?
Though wondering senates hung on all he spoke ,
Fresh as a lark mounting at break of day ,
Which , gathering unclean vapours as it falls ,
And steaming acrid fumes arise ,
His wagship shapes a lesson sad :
' behind me piecemeal gifts i cast ,
The hills again reach skyward with a smile .
Their image lives in many a guiltless mind ,
Trusting a true love for to find .
In unevolved obscurity were bound .
After their sixty years : time never made
And lend their aid to each struggling soul
The greatest loss oft brings the noblest gain ;
They took the train together .
From nature 's chain whatever link you strike ,
But ye owe your empire to such as he ,
Folks sold their votes for draughts of beer .
Fear is the fire that melts icarian wings :
While the sail-yards greet their vision ,
My flower of love that falls half blown ,
Could bring to light its slavery !
These , hot for vengeance , by resentment led ,
It makes the taxes harder on the poor ,
With swords o'fire ready like fate to fall ,
She wholly throws the blame on gryphon good ;
And changed her dreams to dreams of misery .
Of mighty peoples rising in the west ,
Know not , since knowledge saw her branches stript
One yellowed day saving a tattered man .
Is there not one of honour found ,
But that all beauty dies with innocence ! "
To virtue , but through peace . for nature speaks
Love has earth to which she clings
Unless electuaries he 'll bring ,
And join the drowsy nocturnes that arose ,
Unwearied once of what thy bosom gave .
But never more would calm , his amorous rage .
To give his tottering faith a solid base .
Down which life 's currents all must go , --
You will reach a trench of fire ,
The morn that warns th ' approaching day ,
That those who would keep love must dwell apart .
I wot ther is long time passed .
And thus my words of warning speak :
Laughter and tears as we tread on our way ;
But as man 's unbelieving taste came round ,
When the shade of malinche gave battle ,
And men their hate express ,
The spring returned again :
The returning year could bring .
Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow .
What though stars of hope like flowers take flight ?
Whilst her good lord his battles fought .
And this same flower that smiles to-day ,
And some wild horror desperate drove him ,
As the buds shoot forth .
Silver the hills where the moon climbs over .
Of any thing which nature would express ;
Never gave the enraptured air ) ,
And nilah * approaching , and twilight descended .
What answer , chilling us with fear ,
His land her joyous aspect wore .
That make the magic of her face ,
Where the end of my road is lost .
Exclaiming , as they led her to her death ,
By the green stranger ; and the legend brought
In the grove 's dark recesses pours his moan ;
Which in our daily uses followed after ,
Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself
It lies beneath -- my time has come at last
For here the trojan troops the list surround ,
Where honour has the world to gain ,
And thus his death he found .
But you with whom the sweet fulfilment lies ,
Would swim darkly up the brain .
Sad as the last which reddens over one
Over the vines that the wind made shiver ,
Part of the bottom forth , and went his way
Sick pining comes not where these are .
Seem given by the rule of contraries .
Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
Then reached the caverns measureless to man ,
And we will lay it safe therein ,
The blow received . but too much in our life
Love , that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize ,
Stretch your throats , bring in your votes ,
' twill leave no wound or deadly scar .
They rose and follow 'd where he led .
What god gives , and what we take ,
What christian polity was left to glean ,
Too soon she sinks unheeded to the grave ,
My heart sings only when it breaks .
Their glowing virtues , but their crimes confined ;
And feel the promise is not vain ,
Could i have felt thy presence near
I 've caught you smiling !
That tries to race , i still insist
By marble fountains lay the pensive head ,
And she shines with a quiet sadness ,
The light gave colours , which upon them fell ,
Strive not with pain to scale the height
No unhappiness came nigh thee ;
What sweet spell are these elves weaving ,
Which culture may refine --
" his book has come
Wherein true love consists not : love refines
On the mat her hands lay idle ,
A silence followed this sweet air ,
As many a year as it is passed and gone
Following from world to world intent i seek . "
And if we credit what that marble said ,
He felt nervous whenever he ugly sights saw ;
As quick a growth to meet decay ,
And precious spices fill the fragrant air ,
Where creepers filled the air with scent ,
The flower that once has blown for ever dies .
There came a lovely vision of a maid ,
O , that my years of woe were passed ,
" my audience laughed till it cried salty tears ,
As to suffice in rendering grace for grace ;
Angered , stung by a wounded pride ,
And quail to find no rescue from its power .
Slaughtered the innocents . from the trees spun down
That long the lower world in twilight keep .
And generations rise and pass away ,
I will make answer even to the thought ,
And with the blessing seen is satisfied .
" yet hear the law on which must rest
Since i rose out of child-oblivion
He wha could brawlie ward their bellum ,
But from the bearer bold his ensign took :
Over the soil , that everywhere breathed fragrance .
For your sorrowful heart to bear ,
By thy guiding mercy sent ,
That lured him here this golden afternoon ;
His course to a finish has run --
And lead your heroes through the dread abodes
Her white bare feet went softly and sweet
And follow cupid for his loaves and fishes ?
Can give our souls new birth .
The genius of the time soon shifts the scene :
May replace old forms which nothing can restore ;
The lark had left the evening cloud ,
For though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail ,
No factious clamours can control :
And breathe a glorious terror as they blaze .
To such a warfare and such blows give birth ,
The hawthorn soon will bear the wreath ,
This gentle solemn spirit doth possess ,
Where rich tobacco and quick tapers shine ;
Takes the redundant glory , and enjoys
Which those harp-crowded heavens bend to hear
Showing neither joy nor sorrow ;
One flag only , to mark the advance ,
When the stars threw down their spears ,
In thanks for mercy shown , and to bestow
New pleasures on the pyre to make it blaze :
A tyrian light the village fills ;
While her heart is torn with anguish ;
Our life is short , and our days run
And deaths that just hang by a hair ;
To save the stakes , or lose their lives ;
For thee their choicest wreaths prepare ,
Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue ?
Furrowing the foamy wave the boat goes large .
The man that fashioned them and gave them law !
A blunder follows ; and blind industry ,
And from slow lips comes heavily the breath :
" go , wanderer , plough your gloomy sea ,
The gloom that winter cast ,
In all their bloom and brightness given ,
Scorning souls that circles make .
The heart hath no relief but breaking !
Where the fire had just descended ,
The scent is sweet to follow .
It is that thou hast made my life too sweet
Which won thee youthful in thy gayest pride ,
War falls upon thy lovely land and thee . "
Forewarnings ; from the castle go they forth .
Which i gather in a song .
That weave the lace-like light that dims
Thick and more thick they gather round the blood ,
And lost atlantis bore to her .
And sorrow stands apart ,
Jealous of the applause they gave him ,
Their courage like a banner blown .
Given to redeem the human mind from error ,
This is not genius . genius spreads its wings
That with their weight they make the balances
And nature gives no vanity in vain .
The vengeful plot his fury laid .
But this fair hall to truth and freedom given ,
The visions departed , and shame followed passion : --
That always shows great pride , or little sense :
The dry wind whirls the dead leaves everywhere ;
The palm and may make country houses gay ,
Pandora 's incense on his head did pour .
Thought travels freely , leaving self behind .
It moved and moved , and took at last
Ere britain will withdraw her righteous claim
Fair dames and crested chiefs attention bowed ;
The throstle gave them song ,
Brief lights that made a little shining !
Is pietie thus and pure devotion paid ?
Beneath whose shade soft waters glide ,
Make way for the thrill
But those left behind , his dear image reveal ,
Nor whilst an impulse here remain ,
On every side an angry murmur rose ,
The winter woods lie gray and still
From the hearth the flames were flashing ,
Distressed me ; from mine eyes escaped no tears ;
While nymphs take treats , or assignations give ,
That spends its glory on a thousand fields
The hounds melted away with master
From ramparts that had bowed to sudden blows .
Or bubbles which on water stood ;
Then how the little kite thrilled with pride ,
The dead man steer the blind man home --
And lit the fallen leaves that lay ,
Ah , whose dear eyes shall light the feast ?
Which comes unbid to modesty .
Where westminster 's cathedral lifts
Well may the moon delight to shed
Pierced through and dropping blood for me ,
Dejected lies , his pipe in pieces broke
Though summon 'd to a lone retreat
Love that should help you to live ,
To merit , not to seek for fame ,
That scortches my tormented breast .
To the home of him that made it ,
Where i can feel the end of things complete ,
And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain :
Has given the waves their melody ,
Death follows fast upon the man who flees ,
Sweetly , sweetly blew the breeze --
Vaunt the beauties they bring forth .
Still shows its white walls to the rising sun .
We leave a king in persia ,
Embosom 'd in the deep where holland lies .
Destruction waits my call ! -- some demon say
How frequently a kiss in time saves nine .
Still lead our armies to the field .
That human hearts can bear
That say thy sweet is bitter ,
Memory lives in those gone by ;
From ancient hate and enmity , which run
That skirts the ocean 's foam ;
Where a banquet was already spread ,
And all the ladies swim through tears
You 'll dwell with me when time extinguish breath .
He saw ; the deities of crime abhorred ;
And verdant sharon swept by the sea breeze ;
All is alive with light , which brightly glints
Then she was given to charity and pity ,
Saw where the hermit ’s dwelling lay ,
It knew the thrill of spring ;
Aflame with prophecy came she forth her bower .
To join the smoke that wreathed itself above .
Since i had felt his comforting .
With toil his body spent and worn ,
And waits , in snug concealment laid ,
Shall future ages tell the woful story , --
Sprang up redoubled , and cast out my hate
Take a mid place ; the darkened souls sink back
Delight makes all of the one mind ,
To try his fortune to advance ;
Meet for some god whom savage man hath made :
When winter winds are piercing chill ,
Sore task to hearts worn out with many wars
" showing him well , and making his commands
Then casting on his friend an ardent look ,
It moved and moved , and took at last
Till the clock , till the clock struck nine .
And just as in the ages gone before
Like tapers on the altar shine her eyes ;
There i would the earth embrace
What serves one will when many wills rebel ?
A warmer heart death ne'er made cold .
An ' come to stop those reckless vows ,
Death comes to man with hasty stride ,
On wealth if happiness were built ,
But this sad thought augments my pain ,
The immortal gods that spared not for her wail
As one in slumber held . not long that mood
Then out with a laugh went the bonny wee man
And in each house made desolate
Then to the south i made my way
As soon his charity repaid .
But from this there came no healing ,
Their white beards blowing on the mountain air ,
What prudent sire would cast away ?
The empire which their sire controlled .
Her time would come and with it her master .
Ay , sacrifice shall set the prisoner free ,
Of sunset where , with spirits filled ,
When down the west horizon sinks
Deep in his throat he deals a deadly wound ,
Whose announcement appeared much applause to attract .
The calm , the smouldering , and the flame
When everything has gone just right !
He wound his hand in his steed 's mane ,
Of prayer and praise and harmony shall rise !
On quiet streams her broad shields to unfold :
The voice restored , the eye of truth
The hillside vines dear memories of thee bring :
She turned her thought , till softly on her ear
Fate took but an instant to plan it ;
Which shook the hills and forest trees ,
Alone above the stream it stands ,
Give thy decree , without delay ,
't was this that raised the illustrious line ,
With zeal , and equal indignation fired ;
It came with the threat of a waning moon
For when the soul and frame together are sunk
He will restore , and others add beside ;
Gryphon , all thought of pity laid aside ,
Learn 'd things , that to his victory gave rise
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night .
In shining rays the scaly monster spreads
The radiance went on
A double strength of valves secured the place ,
Of love and lore it comes upon .
Through his jaw leapt the sudden-flashing brass :
More it displeases god ; and so stand lowest
Had found the deities averse , and marched
Some fancied clue , some hope awhile restored ,
A stature mingling strength with grace ,
How much that stirs the memory ,
A pang from the thorns may impart ;
Screening my happiness as evening fell .
For slow and slow that ship will go ,
At last the echo died in air
Camilius brings in triumph to his land
Awhile the bliss suspend ;
Where bargains meet for purses spare ,
Thus we rejoiced , but soon our joy is turned
Came two young lovers lately wed .
For women shed and use them at their liking ;
And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes ,
Which chokes the radiance of the moonlight
A hundred voices joined the shout ;
Which with his tears were bred :
Outside the young boy-priest passed singing clear ,
But the cause no physician could nab ;
And feel no delight when such pictures unfold ,
Religious titled them the sons of god ,
Exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold ,
In the quiet falling twilight --
Through painful centuries the slow beast fought ,
That , the last , where sits affright ,
When , more and more the harbour left behind ,
Or difficult , proportioned to the crime .
To follow truth -- wherever it may lead ;
The air hangs sultry as in mid-july .
Nor shall my future actions be confined
‘ or that i farther go . ’
With these four , running these into one soul ,
Nor seek again the dance we left of late .
That hateful fortune , coming as it did ,
That comes so lothly toward her
His answer , eloquent , returned :
A spirit that lies never still ,
Through the dim ages comes only the perfume ,
One word that sums her whole of grief --
For some vague end that never shall arrive ?
The winding sheet of edward 's race .
Even as the winds strew down upon the ground
Where the least jealousy turns love to gall ?
A gloom around them threw ,
And holding truth for guide ,
Your single prowess long sustain 'd the fight ,
To bring one joy to soothe my pain .
And filled with thoughts of joy , he went .
Melt in tears that only ran
Nor feel himself disgraced thereby ;
And the mute graceful genius lowered a torch .
Where the hay lies thick and greenest ,
And bring back honour to your indian wife .
Nor all the centuries , could hide your shame .
Flies flashing , leaps his heart with languid fear ?
But sorrow returned with the dawning of morn ,
At night each pair on splendid carpets lay ,
The hopeless , daily ills of teaching brought
The great trees bending between birth and birth
God speed him whole ! the knights make bets :
From his hunt had come back to my heel .
Ah , love , just two years have gone
And seemed an angel lighted from the skies .
" with loving service fill all this day ,
A fig for dogmas -- let them pass !
Where i can forget that the days go .
A cry impetuous from its depths was drawn , -
Love puts such bitter poison on fate 's arrow .
To make them hold for term of life :
And indra thus his answer made :
Now here attend to what i answer thee ;
Then a long peace upon the whole room comes .
And snatch a fearful joy .
From his calm eyes there gleamed a little fire ,
His right hand high the crosslet bore ,
And bright along the bay the lights came out .
Where the moonlight is gleaming bright as day .
She stumbled now , feeling her sail a load .
Round my life they are laid ,
And took possession of the stock exchange .
That 's what made his eyes so bright ;
In glorious robes and gems , conveyed .
Filled the evening star with splendor ,
Of nature makes the rain ;
The sun of winter hung more near ;
With wants unutter 'd ! all my being caught
What numbers groan for sad admission there !
With love they had to hold .
As if that soul were fled . --
As on its own track rolls the circling year .
Shun or too devoutly follow .
And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain :
To con god 's meaning in each line
And where rests labour there begins decay .
In terror she cried , letting sink her
Unto the glass gorgona torques her eye
That came , that sang through tropic trees ,
The eagle seeks its daily bread .
Waned past : night came : the heavens grew
If thus my faith is lost to me .
Dear father , what hath given thee offence ?
Then sends one sigh forth to the unknown goal ,
And all the miracles your heart contains ,
Of wild flowers shed their breath ,
The redoubtable legions that trampled the world ;
I see you heave the frequent sigh ,
Let them run to other forests ,
Of inconsiderate youth , is to be held
While lovely faces flushed with lust of blood ,
There ! i see thy soul is burning --
Till the sky be washed blue again
Her , armed with sorrow sore ;
He said there 'd come a blazing screeching
How paris placed above her hero , dead ,
There must rest the good and evil . "
In dungeons vile they pass 'd the day ,
One of thy songs , which gives such high delight
Her teats drip the brighter darkness .
But having run thy gauntlet of their days ,
Whom from the flaming walls of troy i drew .
But morning broke with golden gleam ,
Once , when midnight smote the air ,
From the surmises hinted here ,
And brought a breath of the fragrance rare
Nor share the anguish which he bears for thee ?
The night approaches dark and chill :
Though his mouth speaks charming converse ,
Old , but so reverenced , the murderer passed
Conviction to the serpent none belongs .
Till the next morning rang her passing-bell .
The fierce blow crashed through flesh and bone
The ilex trees stood darkly , and the air
Opening his breast his eyes on me he set ,
Where fancy takes the place of passion ; --
And my soul was torn
Which hath left old time displac 'd --
The benthamite yawning left his bed --
She stole the whiteness of the snow ;
A bitter sigh i drew , then scarce found voice
Then wild cries rose from the people --
Of foe amid the grain has cast a brand ,
And the loveliest to his words made answer ,
Make way for others as you sit
With iris-coloured hues the sun embrace ,
Beyond us some short space , in answer came .
Winter with snows has newly filled the glen .
Rested ; the music still the stones retain 'd .
In silence ; grief her rising words repress 'd :
The crown of england drawn from trouble sore ;
In the great hour of destiny they stand ,
I once was pia . sienna gave me life ,
A few choice flowers their garden bore ,
I listened and i thought i caught the word --
He filled our lives with splendour ,
Greater bruises will bring your tears ,
Nature reclaim 'd her order : -- gently flows
My thoughts hold mortal strife ;
Many spent fames and fallen mights --
' his error upon him may fall ;
That clear brook eastward roll its wave
When sun was made to cease to shine
And fruits of labor rising from the land ;
My heart is weary , my peace is gone .
And take occasion for the hairs ,
And when , to share the joy she brought ,
There 's not a flower i see , love ,
In borrowed glory , -- spreading flame ,
Whose bonnets touch the firmament ,
“ next autumn follows , all the fire of youth
And make his end like a conqueror . "
They saw the brimmed brook 's eddies curl .
Dim as the faded battle-smoke ,
The bard can kindle his soul to flame ,
Himself the monarch placed that damsel true .
Which spelled by her illumined eyes ,
Lengthened ran the grasses , the sky grew slate :
By herbs of numbing power subdued .
This to report , my hasty course i bend ;
Of grief comes o'er my heart ;
When , best of all who give delight ,
Which were lost and vainly wasted ,
And his brave spirit led the van
( did the veil of the temple sway ? )
Now is their mourning into dancing turned ,
While the white mist slowly melted ,
Of silver wings he took a shining pair
So into life the idle dream shall steal !
" she fell away in her first ages spring ,
Wavering his thoughts in dubious balance hung :
This vision comes to me when i unfold
Who had late dismissal got .
't is then my eager steps i guide ,
Their high strange ensigns hung upon the sky
With strength from him to stay my fears .
Grasses blowing from the meadow ,
But the spot still shows
Gives this answer to the suitor :
That they may send good luck into the house ?
Outshining of all purity , which takes
Perennial springs water it , and it shows
When bliss is every heart 's employ ? --
To take a long rest in the stable .
There is indeed in mind that heat it gets
The flame they follow , on and on ,
Who marshals us our upward way , unsought ;
Lies , far as the vision can fling ,
This knowledge keep , that may not dim : --
His gentle infant wove , that it might breathe
With hope or promise given of fight ,
Purple tree-shadows crept over the road ,
The souls of flowers lie pent , the precious balm
The soul that in it shone .
Even though in looking on i share the pangs
And the signs made answer truly ,
He gathers all the parish there ;
Much have i done , and freely given ,
They make it scent like bruised cinnamon .
Soft music thrilled the quiet room , --
Is made the dreary ocean 's sport ,
The flush of life may well be seen
Only the bond of love which nature makes ;
Ay , as a hunter mounted for the chase .
Every substantial form , that segregate
And our hearts can kindle at her flame .
A fate which ever claims the woeful tear ,
In this wise then my leader made reply .
Dimness conceals the hunger in our faces ,
That all with mutual impulse tend to god .
Number of nine which makes us full with god ,
I wronged thy patience , till it sighed away .
Much loss or shame my victory will bring . "
Then strange memories crowded back
Dread and distraction wherever he turned --
Of freemen rising for the right
It makes a silent music up in heaven ,
They knew her life , how oft she stood ,
All that life 's palpitating tissues feel ,
Before them lay their path through the wide world --
And quickness of perception which belong
And air 's sweet race melodious homes had made ;
Slowly and wavering , turnus quits the fight ,
And bid the shepherd bring his flocks to fold .
And he spoke the words which follow :
With horror shook , and trembled through its frame .
And sometimes , just to catch the breeze ,
But then the thought of parting made her quake ;
The steeples swam in amethyst ,
Through which their hope shall rise .
But the stars keep their spring sublime ;
Where he shall find not only rest , but balm
These northern scenes with weary feet i trace ;
Glow more bright when summer leaves them glowing ,
Of god and of the world , made manifest .
She left her joyful harpings in the sky ,
The clouds make pictures for me , so
These freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads
Rest and put by anxieties . "
" the women when they find themselves betrayed
Agramant finds no shelter ; from the sky
Peculiar suffering answering to the sin , --
That those who disbelieved might their obedience see .
Yea , loss itself be turned to precious gain .
And running down the soul , a shape that fled
The curves swelled out from the flower-like frame
Which made him cut hat 's rhetoric shorter ,
Down goes the brake and the rest encore ;
Like waves that never touch a beach .
When he 's led to judgment near ! "
A press of hurried notes that run
Of rural younglings raise the shout ;
As may be felt in homeward-sailing ships
The time shall come when strangers rule no more ,
As evening comes to take his place ;
The swarms of swanks lay low --
Around their heads the whistling javelins sung ,
It lies , yet ere conception to prevent
Where frugal monks their little relics show ,
The eyes that watch for the ships shall weep
That young men rarely made monastic vows ;
Who heard his words were filled with grief .
As o'er the church the gathering twilight falls
Wherewith foul envy did his heart inspire .
Spain knows who leads those files across the sea ;
Then a silence came to the river ,
It makes the land as ocean free ,
And calls his country to assert his cause ;
While agamemnon wastes the ranks around ,
And hospitality to him was shown .
In the morning , glad , i see
Ere greece rose dreadful in the avenging day ;
To thee all secrets of all hearts belong !
Which can not be by chance or fortune crossed :
Sunders with shifted face , and britain 's sons
The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowed
" if she be made of white
Hath kept her tearful watch above the earth ;
Mind can not follow it , nor words express
Fate gave the word , the arrow sped ,
Saints and angels stand
Once and again and again descended the murderous blow .
Our souls go out at elbows . we are sad
To lean in joy upon our father ’s knee ;
The mighty monarch , struck with awe ,
The soul comes issuing with the vital blood :
Scarce heard a murmur but what ocean gave :
That shook with horror at thy fall .
If some may turn to god and live .
Oft brought a light into my eyes -
That many vessels to the bottom went ;
Clipping thy monstrous breast thou shalt it find . '
Although to deepest hell the paths descend . "
He felt himself beyond all human aid ,
And thou , my heart , mirth also show ,
Her lofty walls not long our progress stay ’d ;
Through eden took their solitary way .
To make a fool of her more surely .
Winter snows , summer is gone .
And shaped and cherished -- which with joy expanded ,
That the crown of success weighs hard and presses
Like courteous king , the kindly offer made :
Be lifted at thy shapeliness and air ,
And other signs of grief were shown .
From off the eternal altar flowing ,
Had felt fierce pangs from the poison-fangs
In the land where the dead dreams go .
While heaven but spared the sire she loved ,
The reed poured forth the woodland melody ,
And love 's self find not an hour ,
Ye muses , make them poor again .
She was active , stirring , all fire --
Thy dark walls stood in a most barren place ;
Seing the doubled shadowes low to fall ,
To give him a penny -- he seems to feel
Showed the sad wounds that thy neglect had wrought ,
Still follow fortune where she leads the way . ]
Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude :
To wray the woe that makes her weep ;
From tower and dome its glories spread ;
Golden rays to shed about me ,
Answered in the words which follow :
We miss the warm , caressing shore ,
The armies fade , the lustre dies .
( then first the creature found a tongue ) ,
Gives comfort to his country 's foe . "
Along a rutless road that leads
The wind blew very strong .
Did make provision , thorough grace alone ,
Words that only an english tongue could tell .
We boys took manfully this frown of fate ;
Now the clouds are gathering round us ,
So from the first , eternal order ran ,
Though ten bars protected likewise .
Thou know ' st already how to trim the goal
“ retorting , made the god remember too :
Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight !
And , each to each in friendship bound ,
From the dark and clawed my face .
Just as the mind the erring sense believes ,
A thing that creeps , it can not go ,
Hurls thundering forth to fight their lowering troops ,
The sturdy clans pour 'd forth their brawny swarms ,
Set any spinster 's heart on fire ?
What roses make by day and night --
And therefore he makes war of his ambition ;
Which the rhone 's murmur fills --
Now if you want my theories i go on .
Why should not piety be made ,
For glittering night whence death comes unto them .
And banish intruders who give themselves airs .
Though the streams now did make no haste ,
Which filled his heart with glee .
Before the immortal bridegroom led the way
That queened it over the sprinkled round ,
That smiles , and smiling saves ,
To the sound the fountains made .
And give us courage in a sense
Their tricks and craft have put me daft .
With this their lamps they fed .
Truncheons of shiver 'd lances hung between ;
Or ere brown evening spreads her chilly shade . "
Grieved for the king , his death will share .
The cold fear that follows and finds you ,
And thoughts , in other words arranged ,
And like the lava leaves a scorched line ,
Love and the sense of kinship inly bred
Painters have drawn for us marvellous lines ,
The future times may carry , or what be
Not in despair , to have found themselves not lost
The wine was slow to bring him woe ,
Her forces mixed of craft and passion urge
And took his titles and his oaths ;
Is lost in the wanton woman now --
Or it might be my veins ran cold , --
And he spoke the words which follow :
But faith that soars to seek the sky
Who swept the loud chords of a lyre ;
Some old emotion long had ceased to live ;
His blood-gained liberty is lost !
They ' eard old songs turn up again ,
Thought travels freely , leaving self behind .
Doth loose the worlds sway for a fickle woman .
This beauty calls for valiant song --
So come to the poet his songs ,
Nothing save holiness is left her now .
Till happy thoughts made her gladder ;
That heavenly charms to sin have never led ,
But yet gainst every hap whence mischief grows ,
What i to you this day relate ;
As morning shows the day . "
Seeing our gods are different , and commanding
Comes like the language of thy speaking eyes ;
It scarcely reaches a flagstaff high ;
With choice we fix , with sympathy we burn ;
And he was with his journey spent .
Had struck life , lifeless , at a word ,
Has found real greatness here below .
His steps come near , his anxious pleading face
Evil no nature hath ; the loss of good
First blew her away right out of the sky --
And then she gave juanna a chaste kiss :
My girl-heart turned and clung to you !
From many stars this light comes unto me ;
Save failure only , seized me . evil finds
They of our mortal diseases find never healing physician ;
Must weep o'er pleasures fled away ,
If my lips speak fact or fiction . "
He suffered and descended into hell --
Nor horror took me here , where was no pain
And kindred fields where victors ' praises rang ?
Where precipices frowned and torrents ran .
Religion satisfied ; truth shall retire
While these lays and incantations
Which from the eternal fountain are diffused .
How far minerva ’s force transcends thy own ?
Thy fields of waving , golden grain ,
And trembling in the hollow belly stood .
She was nearly blown away .
From out man 's members it has gone away .
With such a servant danger comes , i fear .
Thou art led to fields of flowers ,
In art or nature aught so passing sweet ,
The lightning of her eyes to form ?
Was forced to pause until antonius brought
Like a ghost , that goes at sunrise ,
The lass that made the bed to me !
This virtue comes not from the stars above ,
Oh , give me the spot where affection may dwell
The good we still as good shall find .
And pains of awful penance bore .
What gives this beauty to the grave ? the shroud
I burn , my tears can never drench it
Perchance those waxen petals might reveal
The frown of nature smiled .
Though lots on ' t goes for beer .
Over the strings that lie asleep ?
And my spirit ran free .
A strange shape leapt to the driving wheel
I blush to offer sorrow unto thee ,
Both were mine ! life went a-maying
His hostile breath through the dry rafters sent ;
Showed us that france had something to admire .
With a quicker count will go .
They turn to sweetness , and drop holy balm ,
And lawe hath take hire double face ,
And on the road he met with a rat .
And where kind tongues bring no captivity ;
There the first roses of the year shall blow ;
The fatal asterisk of death is set ,
Not following christ , by the experience
She followed still and soothed my care .
Shudder that made them one .
Making the sun still in his course to stand .
My heart all winter lay so numb ,
To follow " found the promise there declared
While jesu 's mercy loudly cries ,
Poet or patriot , rose but to restore
Come flatter then , or chide my grief ;
The time when first the sun thy circle set --
Allah gives rest in pain ,
Where white rob 'd peace her envied blessings pours ,
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;
Give me the life that follows the bending sails ,
The first , first woe my spirit knew ,
Though flowers have grown a thousand years above her ,
To save thy secret soul from nightly fears ,
Dark jaws , the breath rises
“ thou hast , by heavenly grace sustained ,
And to augustus they so spread the flame ,
Into the scale , and make the balance equal .
On nimble feet that bounded to the strand
All music and all silence held thereby ;
Foul usury doth not more lift itself
Then from a long scroll make him cry ,
Yet entrance none to his flesh they made .
The years have passed in ceaseless round
Unconquered cato shows the wound he tore ,
Which gives out flame , yet it its whiteness shines
Whereon cool wind hath always blown
Who can so well the toil of war endure ?
Headlong , impetuous , see it pour :
( for time , though in eternity , applied
And my mortal foes that lie in wait
They would perceive what pardons they confide in ,
Pure was the life she led
Possession sate his thirst , but still pursues
To mysteries strange and hateful rites returned :
For a hero who should wield it . "
That follow on the heels of all who walk
Where the moss lies smooth and deep ,
They would not make me move the faster ,
Do they portend approaching death , which tells
As by some artist , to whom vulcan gives
Then will no more such sport be found .
The death of all , and all together lost .
As if she had shook hands with misery ,
And good wine is not put beneath the ban ,
The tears of remembrance will gather and fall ,
They stay their crystal fretting ,
That can to other give eternall dayes .
Agastya once , the worlds who viewed
And so it rolls into the night again .
If only now i could recall that touch ,
Every thing holds a slender guiding clue
Gone and blown in all your cash
The common lot we scarce perceive .
While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down ,
As i strove to make them understand
I felt the fast years slip and reel
Enormous shadows , wearing distinct shapes ,
That breast i held divine .
Where happy feet went to and fro ,
Never ought ter make a noise ,
The contents which the pages ensuing shall bear ;
And dance had been and wine flowed free ,
I must stand the winter shocks ,
Were dimmed or ruffled by a wintry sky .
Our love was nature ; and the peace that floated
Or the soft journey which a planet goes :
In the sea springs up a mountain ,
My heart would leap to greet such coming lord ,
And dash its trophies down !
The azure flowers that blow ;
That , beaten , still kept up the fight .
Yet in our hearts its sorrow lay ;
She , only she gives zest to life ,
Of warrior chiefs his mind expressed :
He married her ! perhaps it spoils the tale --
His earthly kindred , seeking quietude
Thy race came hither to crush mine own .
Promethean fire snatched from the olympian height --
` will venture to impugn his common sense ;
Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise
The son 's obedience knew no no ,
And spent his life in sport and play .
With its golden bird still sailing air ,
Let signs and beacons fall or stand ,
Uttered he the words which follow :
He sits with wounded foot , he makes repair .
Who knows what endless practices are held ,
Up to his attic came the city cries --
His heart with sorrow down is weigh ’d ,
Such the proud triumphs that the good achieve !
To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow :
The low-hung lamps stretched down the road
With the flag of peace still furled ,
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust .
That liquor on my logic floats like oil ,
To see thee every day that came ,
Now westward sol had spent the richest beams
And when she takes her shutters down ,
The depths of heaven reflected there .
Would charge the sun with darkness , and accuse
And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade ,
These best of all verses belong ,
Days passed . the golden summer
Have made room there to weep
Of him that brought salvation down ,
Couch , in softness laid ,
And could not make answer .
And luck may turn , and mine be mended ,
To the world of beauties nature lent ,
For meditation fixed at times on him ;
And see thou persevere in piety .
The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned .
As the sunlight turns the lane 's mud
Where faith sees plain the pageant pass
And the one loss gave all that seem 'd before
As far rolls back the selfish undertow ;
Than the melodies which brought sweet order
He took a tavern-bed that night ,
But feel life 's daily sufferings
The western tide crept up along the sand ,
Dat toad he up an ' go to sleep ,
It gives a very echo to the seat
With lips that toil and thirst had dried ;
For me thy bleeding side was pierced , for me
Till the god of heaven took pity on her ,
In him alone . can nature show so fair ?
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
And providence have wrought thus quaintly . here
And breathing o’er thy frame dispense
That must come later when we know our minds ,
Stars made the orchards seem a-bud ,
Kindness soothes the bitter anguish ,
It calls each hour for stronger hearts and braver .
Death may come , and love take wings ;
He brings me blessing , and i swore
When the snow lay round about ,
Linked to ambition , came :
Your vast unconsciousness was thrown . . . .
To tell the sleeping world that dawn was near .
And make thee father of a happy line . "
The sounds increase , and now are seen
So i went onward timorous and thoughtful .
Divided , till his rescued gain their shore :
The sage in meditation found ,
While pleased i take the gift thy hands present ,
At times would the lure of this mirage prevail ,
By shrewdly managing his cards ;
If things had come his way .
Whatever winter winds may blow .
They as in duty bound should love
When death 's unvexed repose gets hold on man
The edge of the storm will reach it soon .
The curse of fortune 's still recurring wheel ;
That man , created in god 's image , placed
Than when she made old england one ,
The little wandering prayers of human love ? ...
My moments seem 'd reduced to few ;
Still its changeless light is shed .
No voice stirred through the haunted hill
And sensual bliss is all the nation knows .
And made thy woodlands ring !
My dreaded name compels the foe to flee .
The dagger that stabbed not to kill him ,
In her proud eyes sat triumph on a throne ,
It ran to meet her as she came
Striving to reach the mystic source of things ,
They spring another flood of fangs and claws .
Whose pride has failed to get him anywhere . )
Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought ,
Till glittering visions bring the uneasy sigh
Hour after hour , her gold curls sweeping it ;
To the fragrance and aroma found in a weed ,
With golden apples . days pass ,
You flung forth fortune -- to ensure him his ?
One firm resolve , they onward pressed ,
While earth lay shrouded in the gloom of night .
Spread all your canvas , all your oars employ ,
His vague voice calls him from the darkened plain ;
And the free soul to flitting air resign 'd :
Across the vacant day-blue dimly trailing !
Of laughter flickering back from shine to shade ,
The ghastly deeds that sinners wrought --
The countless troops around him spread ,
We both fell silent , striving to recall
Has come to seek protection of the order ;
Believe not therefore that your cause is gained .
The roar of baleful battle rose ,
It runneth through the trees ,
Thro ' the white fingers flushing came .
That met above the merry rivulet .
Than nature 's fullest giving --
No mystic dream could make their fates appear ,
And take the penance on myself alone ;
His limbs withhold from shaking --
And heaps his gains by slow degrees ,
And they whom storm hath forced that way since ,
Surrounding crowds the victor 's praise proclaim ,
Be his whom she held dear ,
Nor rivals tightly belted for the race .
Than the best fortunes that do fall ;
Where priam 's ancient palace stood .
We 'll take a look at the country stock
And various artifice , the queen she placed ;
Haunting the drifted sunlight where they go ,
Life 's morning fill its promise soft .
The hand of sorrow touched me ,
Perchance thy fury might at length be stayed .
And trees , all spreading to the sun ,
Broadcast he scattered anarchy .
The royal brother thus his grief express ’d ,
When regret grows aspiration ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
To grasp the greater wisdom , reach not me ,
And fixed , dull stare , that only sees
To put the question with an air sedate ,
A quiet chamber kept for thee .
At morning-tide when day-dawn broke ,
And through lost lanes , -- when darkness falls ,
Once a tale of peace it sung
Could give me ties of family and home ;
By the last sunset touch that lay
What hope remains for thee and me . "
And found my pensive soul 's congenial home
War left it empty as his vacant mind ;
The garden close lies sick and sorrowing .
And by the flag that floats out over you ,
Rubies that smouldered once for aztec kings ,
Love , in you , went passing by ,
And the rotten foundation of old superstition exposed .
Invisible faces hauntingly and slow .
Even as the life from their loved one fled .
" his conquered scholar hath this answer sent ; "
Harp-tones ! that shaped before the poised mind
The utter agony hath seized him now ,
The wind blew fresh and free .
Sure i can take my bible oath
Living , that body vexed us ; being dead
The lovely son whom she had starved to make .
To share my somewhat lofty rank
My sight directed , and on either side
There lies for me the only paradise ;
The fork that first my hand would reach
Of golden warp shall shoot it through and through ,
With love that doth pursue us ,
If there were added but one drop of bliss ,
But the bells shall join in a joyous chime
The path for me to take ? -- it goes
To join its summit to the neighbouring skies ;
That make the laden robber grin askance
Pity 's flood there never rose .
Time passed . my eldest girl was married ,
But taking the year together , my dear ,
Draws forth the floods of scorn and ridicule ;
A moment now he slacked his speed ,
Till fate so strangely led my footsteps here ,
Not many full-faced moons shall wane ,
But the glasgow heroes bore the bell
Little by little , there came forth another .
Yet evil whence ? in thee can harbour none ,
And following still the teachers of my youth
The spirit of the lord is going
Since the good paladin could reach no higher .
And dares not lift to thine his eyes .
Perhaps a mother 's anguish adds its woe ;
Till the sun dropped from the heaven ,
Till the rivers rise a-main !
No remedy but death remains .
Ye felt your maker 's smile that hour ,
And make the glory of this conflict theirs .
A soul immortal , spending all her fires ,
Brave steeds go three by three .
Thence gathered his own doom ; which understood
Looked forth so sweet a faith ,
A sail that might have saved him comes and goes
In this wise , to his melody returning ,
With flying fingers touched the lyre :
As soon the rooted oaks would fly
Fold , and dissolve you in a last embrace .
Are broken -- but i love thee still !
His countenance keeps least concealed from us ,
Reached not the heart that courage kept
That lasting love which father bears to son !
So purged of all remembrance and sucked back
Cannon-balls that ask not whom they strike !
Give me a storm ; if it be love ,
Where cairo stands , or memphis stood .
Tho for it he may never reach nirvana .
And thoughts of her come upon my mind gently ,
And from our weight of fear set free
' and is the fair example followed , sir ,
The road winds out its weary way ,
Remembering some faded word of love
Exhausted , he resorts to solemn themes
' twill make a man forget his woe ;
What pieces of their minds i 've taken !
The wind blew gustily ,
Makes wintry music , sighing as it goes ,
We touch our memories and put them all away --
And follows in the steps of love .
But whoso takes his cross , and follows christ
He lifts his hand , gives benediction ;
Steed against steed , went ruining . breast and head
Many pictures come to me
And makes them darker than the dreary realms ,
And vengeance took for many a grecian slain .
Where naught could come but visions of delight ,
Come the undying thoughts i bear ?
Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine ,
See gloomy clouds obscure the cheerful day !
The painted farm-house shining through the leaves
Frae civil war that flows ;
Scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts !
His mind through many thoughts and memories ranged .
All toil must come to nought .
Strength swells thy boiling breast , infused by me ,
For while the tired waves , vainly breaking ,
That dark-winged bird that sought the skies
Call comedy , to prompt him with a smile ?
They kept the faith and fought the fight .
And leave no world untouched -- but race ,
Who made things pleasant greenhorns to allure ;
It shows as a silvern stream .
A chance-dropped word may set me sweating !
He gave them a great and glorious victory ,
Where with a smiling visage memory sits ,
But , longer in that paradise to dwell ,
Expiring on iphidamas he fell
In the true god , and christian faith embrace .
There came a people face to face with these ,
Rich vesture o’er the king was laid .
With nameless pleasure , finding life so sweet ! "
That can touch the strings in concord . "
The human soul that through me ran ;
It was as if an angel passed . --
Beheld the trees with autumn 's bounty crowned .
And hurry him to his fate .
No more such kisses give to me .
Where hope 's fair emblems grew ;
Blind , haunting chants , which speak
Of justice that makes anger terrible
The mocking bird shivered with cold and pain ,
The mounting waters of that red-lit sea
To love alone those instincts speak
_ the moon still waited , watching her _
A little while , when night and twilight meet .
That haply to the unknown land may reach .
And has turned him from vice unto bliss ;
And the flood which rolls its milky hue ,
While he against their fury yet finds grace . '
To bear her cloudy flame ,
Here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light ,
And a nation is filled with woe .
Though a sweet show was spread for thy delight
Fame shall his deeds recall --
If then the spirits only stray , let mine
With breath too quick to lift a sigh ,
While they the bitter tear in secret pour ,
But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes ,
The very churches melted down their chimes
Tho ' the biting north wind breaks
Are broken up ; the rushing rains descend ,
And wisest clerks have miss 'd the mark ,
Up to the moon is cast --
They make me want to whisper that summer sky is
Yet when the clouds are gone
He died for heaviness that his cart went light :
And feel that i could rouse your soul the way
Weaving the fancies suiting such a day .
The frost of hermit age might warm ;
From her dark brow and found her fair .
April appeared , the green earth 's impulse came ,
But came the waves and washed it away :
One look exchanged that our two spirits took ,
At hearing this ? psyche , shrunk like the leaf
Was not with dora . she broke out in praise
He caught them , thrilled them , shouting :
It stills all our laughter , and whispers low --
With every flower this earth has got
If raised past hope by luck or wit ,
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking ,
Fairies tripping merrily
Then hath the day arisen of our defeat
Of beauty cut in marble , fused in bronze .
Yon alps took life , with all the dire array
The music beauty from it draws .
That brings my heart its joy unspeakable ,
New forms arise , while other forms decay ,
Of all that it contains . the following heaven ,
Vaśishṭha gave his glad consent ,
He summoned his braves , all painted for war ,
The magistrate sprang ere he 'd opened his eyes .
" mother , thy words of consolation find
Pass sentence-yield him up to crucify ;
This menace fix ’d the warrior to his throne ;
And equal rapture glows thro ' every night .
With all the ceremony settled --
Every week of every month will seek thee . ”
And the moonlight flowing over all .
There the sprightly pickles stand ,
And backed by the reflected blue .
The sunshine which smiled might have vanish 'd away ,
This which was made , as you must know ,
The fig-tree split , and two tears rolled
So felt their shepherd on that sabbath-morn
By wings of unclean spirits made !
Across this tireless , surging , tossing sea !
And lift the household out of poverty ;
Failing to grasp his life 's intent
Eyes that seemed to ask a question ,
All the tides triumph when the white moon fills .
( his chains had lost themselves ) ,
We felt the minutes crawl :
And cast off all the burden of my sins ,
Song that holds remembrance fast ,
Thy face doth come between me and the heaven --
By a slight motion followed out the imprint .
While through the murmuring windows rose and sunk
Men that made a man of me .
And lend a torch to guide the trembling maid
The empire great in which you shine
Which veil the skies indeed , but give the rains
The red leaves flutter idly down ,
A little lamp hath put ,
But never have sought nor sighed for change ;
Snow might kill the rose-tree 's root --
Against him one by one ; and these returned ,
Who gave me the goods that went since ?
And found the secret in the gospel word .
O pious priestess ! make a peace for us .
Your peaceful zeal shall find .
Turning her gladness to despair ?
Beneath thy dread achievements low they fall ,
True , if this city seven times rounded was
A little snake quivering with anger sped ,
Which ever give small heed to hapless worth ;
The household-god of thought is made ,
This morning saw i , fled the shower ,
The quenchless flames of anguish burn
But men may come to worse than dust .
But when it set on earth arose in heaven .
The hope , the trust , the purpose stayed ,
Why has your power shaped that way so ill ?
It writhes to reach the sound .
And still the soul stood sullen by the clay :
For he knows who makes him thrive ,
While in the coral crown that bound her brow ,
And all the ministers took heed
When i do count the clock that tells the time
The morning-stars that sang above the bower
All the links this earth hath given ,
Whose force description only would abate :
So strength first made a way ;
And burning eloquence , as leaves are swept
Cold winter storms lay standing corn ,
Is based on service law --
The admiring soul ! she feels as if from earth
Hate rises as they strike , the murderous arm
And love -- for this our cry to lift .
But hope stayed bright in sun or rain ,
Is it hope you bring , or fear ?
Laborious shadows revolve and break and gleam .
Long have i borne thy service , through the stress
She said : the pitying audience melt in tears ;
Pronounce who can : for all that learning reaped
But like a tired man going to his rest ,
" no bird can tell its mystery . "
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes .
The western sky lies glimmering , faint and far ,
Where winds know how to sting ;
Their faces wearing smiles .
Shows what comfort each one takes .
Thus the night passes by
Our patient fathers trifling themes laid by ,
Out of the slipping dream-stuff half withdrawn .
No longer rages rescuing from death
Our lives asunder , as for some , but drawn
Of life may round themselves to memory
Rejoiced , and thus his gratitude express 'd .
Ring out the false , ring in the true .
The fountain of joy is fed by tears ,
And into the brine go one and all .
Lifting to rest the city sanctified ,
Deceived , deceiving taught , to these refer ;
Thine image seek , thy glory see ;
The breath that fills it is thine own .
And what her aims and what her arts pursue .
Showing their birth , and where they did proceed ?
His effervescence , pointed to the gems
I laid a love that was dead or dying ,
Full in sight ran on before him ,
When the fastest shearers are making play ,
Then forth sprang gabriel 's wings , off fell
When thus the rite is mocked and stayed ,
My wits had left me quite confounded .
My wrath will never work thy righteousness .
Whereon hope 's moonlight never lies ,
A man gets confidential ere the honeymoon has sped --
Here comes all that breeds the strife ;
Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff .
The bugles murmur and the banners furl ,
And who her joy can tell ?
With his war-club smote the doorways ,
The long and tedious months move slowly by
But wrought upon his mood and hugged him close .
That , sinking soon into the grave ,
But nothing daunted , up they get ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Thy candor when it falls to thee
For all the pain thy folly brought on me !
But if i draw it forth he dies . ”
His costly revels gained an envied fame ,
The battle join 'd , and clamor loud began .
Have reddened the pacific , who hath sacked
His brother tierri raise the king , and place
But what confirmed that fame in every ear ,
The fault which lies direct from any sin
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
If slumber came his aching lids to close ,
And the wide region owns his dread command .
Were rage still harbour ’d in the haughty king ;
In their conjunction met , give me to spell ,
The trees upon the shore , her cottage stood ;
Shall find his avarice there and cowardice ;
The incense mounted like a cloud ,
But in good time true merit leads the van ,
Whose every wave some watery monster brings ,
Thus they throughout the city made their moan ;
Answered in the words which follow :
The music rises and the empty cheers
In vain , where no acceptance it can find ?
And round thy yielding neck transported twines ;
To bear an untried pain ,
And cry 'd she wrought with more almighty fire ,
Was human passion -- with the balance gone ;
But upon thetis sleep laid not his hand :
A tiny barque that skimmed across the lake ,
My happy tears came springing :
Give grace to him who owns his wrong !
Give them healthful rest and slumber ;
To follow our daring with smiles and with song ,
And a sweet wind bears it company .
Old planets fade , new stars shall dimly burn ,
These sounds i 'll strive to catch ;
And lost to sight the ecstatic lark above
See the water foaming as the waves go by
May thy cool breath to my heart bring healing !
Still pining in his childless grief ,
Fear stirs the pulse and drains the throbbing heart ,
The wood caught fire and flamed like flax :
She lay aswoon , nor guessed the scope
While the dancers merrily glide .
Of sinners pinion 'd on the torturing wheel ,
All lesser glories to the sun revealed .
Which came and went , yet ever nearer grew ,
Two lovely children claims my care ,
Kindness and gentleness , truth without peer ,
The bees fell stifled in the smoke
How hard that chain will press at last .
All jars and strife among the gods proceed . "
Which nods with many a heavy-headed tree :
And courage flowed again in me --
" that these found truth out at a glance ,
Ulysses took th ' advantage of their fright ;
The spirit of england none can slay !
In the meadows of life we strayed together ,
She withdrew some steps ; then letting intuition smother fear
Of grace hath come , without baptismal rites
Where the hay lies thick and greenest ,
Springs the stress felt
Fell thick upon him , lost nor form divine ,
With strength to wait , but fixed as fate ,
I will send thee fell destruction ,
From his footprints flowed a river ,
For the fragrance on him laid ;
That the wrath of the abbot he 'd feel .
And sick wi ' a ' i see ,
The leaves are swollen , i feel them beat ,
Through life 's long dream new prospects entertain .
" into each life some rain must fall . "
My cry prevailed , by strong affection urged .
Her fatal image from the temple drew ,
To seek him rather where his mercy shines .
Him , who embodied in the palfrey goes ,
And forced the routed ranks to stand the day .
Around my feet the clouds are drawn
A finer strain its trumpet sings ,
To seek convenient quarters in all the country round .
That was strung together by trills of tears ,
Leaves a loveless world , bereft and lonely .
His dream had placed him in a crystal wide ,
The waters and the cliffs that bound them ;
Pierced by an archer ; while his blood is warm
As she made answer wearily :
But youth is blind and wisdom comes too late .
Some springtime that was all too quickly blown ,
And never a bitter word will come from her ;
A sheep lay tethered , and her life
The victor warrior came in triumph home ,
Wordsworth to be confessed as an impassioned poet .
Gardens and groves that seemed to shine
To raise foul dis from his infernal seat :
Soon she spreads the cruel tidings ,
And seemed to listen , till he caught
To any newer love i might have found ,
Beyond the mountains that lay between
Dismounted ; for no weapon raged as his .
And led by hasty rage and fury rash ,
In that fierce light which beats upon a throne ,
And make strong engines to assault the town .
My love first came into my sight ,
His mind could hardly grasp the change .
To steal a stir of the heavenly thrill :
There came a mercer wonder-fine ,
Congenial warmth retaining , moisten 'd felt ,
And the loud ocean 's swelling tide .
The lines , and ramparts his attention takes , }
The care and pains this somehow stole from me )
Through the hazy air , past the brazier flaring
The winter 's past , the rain is gone ;
It is my sin alone that brought it all .
Which gave fresh turns to all his youthful dreams .
When went by their pleasure , then ?
Let thine answer be as follows :
I painted it , this famished wretch you see ;
Each sentence hangs perfectly poised to a letter ;
Through tingling silence of the frosty night --
With furious madness fired , and stern disdain ,
There , while the mourner turns his aching eyes
He that may fall once , never firmly stood .
Given by the poor and humble ,
All music holds for him a deeper strain
The heavy darkness that no dawn will break ?
In the calm grave shall find at last repose ,
Where courage sits , impregnable and grim --
The changing year came round to autumn-tide ,
But fortune 's gifts if each alike possessed ,
Meadows are gay , bees hum and scents arise .
We caught , but with a laughing crowd
Dragon-like eyes that bled :
Love wronged , and virtue forfeit , and tears wept
The trepidation talked , and that first moved ;
A while they spent in pastime sweet ,
And when morning ’s dawning brought the morning ,
If adversity stands at the door .
Whenever through her soul swift feelings gush ,
To change your life , or else renew it ,
Our hearts , whose high affections burn alone
Then ( lastly ) july comes , and she
Unto his foredoomed fate had gone ,
Which made them apt for so much understanding ;
And mountains , that like giants stand ,
All that protecting care could give .
Eyes with bursting terror gaze
Though heaven forbids my wrath to swell ,
Whilst its drooping branches spread ,
What god permits with different view .
Which can be shaped to truth and harmony ,
His gospel message flowed as truth set free .
As lofty meru rose in sight .
The blessing given thee that was thine alone ,
And golden autumn passes by ?
More chastity too their faces held
Warm perfumes rise ; the soft unflickering glow
Mine hours of ease i spent with thee ,
Whose shining makes their transcendental dawn ? "
On the shallows are spread in despair .
This venom 's might is swiftly bringing death !
The lion , loosened and in full control --
From a blue land that dreams beyond the skies .
This was the purchase that he made :
They fade and pass , the fleeting flowers ,
Then came a sight that made the bravest quail :
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing ;
Your manhood , bend no suppliant knees ,
It makes me very much surprised and sad ,
Should charge the land with snow .
The great procession swept .
And through whose thorns the sunbeams run
And pendant branches trail their foliage fine
' mid the clouds beyond which spreads the infinite world
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
His vengeance sunk the haughty foes in night ;
And earth would be shrouded in sadness and gloom ,
But when to mischief mortals bend their mind ,
Low and more low my spirits sink .
Loud fame already to thine ears has brought :
Of these affections wider made ,
" that to the full thy knowledge may extend
And yet , from kindness , they at once engage
When harebells scarcely show thy trace ,
Pleas 'd with the distant prospects rising new ,
Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway ,
No rich embroidery shines to grace his bed ;
In green and white i see .
Night and day will sing my praise ,
Flame boils up to meet down-rushing flame
No farther seek his merits to disclose ,
To catch that glance of thine --
That gives us back the image of our mind .
Thence the relentless heart forgets to feel ,
His gesture such his troubled soul declared ,
Why stand we longer shivering under fears ,
Here it goes , -- like little feathers ,
Within this hollow cavern hung
Which swept the ruins of a world away .
He 'll think himself as safe at west point fort
And put not forth my goodness , which is free
Like watchers of the dead whose names they bear !
And only such can make a happy home .
A numerous squadron , which the gate maintain ;
And allah and the stars their watches keep .
Of warfare . hence came down that python huge
In the gloom of thy thought are found ?
The human race descended from forebears .
What place is left for words of measured praise ,
" who put the french to rout ;
Of trumpets can not pierce ; whom thunder can
And the worlds gallop headlong to destruction !
And , though it stirs not , dominating all .
And evermore the strife waxed deadlier .
And the deepest place but reached its chin .
From jesse 's loins a stripling sprung ,
For his only thoughts resided ,
Meaning given by virgil to his relation to aeneas
Nothing but sordid dust lies here . "
Thither do my musings go !
And hour by hour upon his vision rose ,
Our athos rests -- the wise , the kind ,
How i have followed , night and day ,
Your bedford votes would wish to change their fare --
Before the lusty day was springing ,
The puzzled look her forehead wears ;
That lay in the house that
Laid out for dead , let thy last kindness be
I lay this volume at your feet ,
Longing for light , that i may find belief ,
Stript of the flowers it wore all day ,
And thus in turn his answer made :
The fleet of death rose all around .
Of pride it may not show a trace ;
Under whom every wickedness lay dead ,
Is founded in the faculty which sees ,
Who owed her life and safety to his sword .
She pressed their tender suffering on mine own .
Better the greedy wave should swallow all ,
By cackling , as their sires saved rome .
Was suited to those plentiful old times ,
Impatience of their task came o'er them ,
Like the lone bird that flutters her pinion ,
Then she took up her burden of life again ,
' i consider poetry very subordinate to moral and political
And i 'll build up a giant with you .
Doth virtue or a vice create ?
Who think it freedom when a part aspires !
Oh how contentment in their foreheads shined !
A sound came from the land ;
Yearning breasts and burning breasts , cold at last ,
Send echoes , from thy chord as sweet .
It murmurs , hums , it swells and rings ,
Of coming tribulation . gentle nurse ,
Here , while the sun his polar journeys takes ,
Thus perforce they make a stand-still ,
Taking his last look of this lovely scene .
Her cap of velvet could not hold
But when the trojan piles in ashes lay ,
Even all the strains his skill could reach unto :
Dearer than life she holds it . i remember
The poets , who on earth have made us heirs
My strength of soul is fled ,
The sun resigns the world to night ;
It glanced along the heavy clouds ,
This my sword shall drink her life-blood ,
A column of the desert met his way .
Anguish came upon the swallower ,
There came a sound of singing on my ear ,
Comes to proclaim a beauty , a perfection ;
To give god thanks , they for rich blessings sued
Say , rushed the bold eagle exultingly forth ,
Forward came the married heroes ,
By right use only can its good be shown ;
This morning saw i , fled the shower ,
Of laughter and of tears keep her from being
And feel that life is wisest spent
What fair trees rise in blooming pride !
And let thy misty vapours march so thick ,
But deep within their yearning , burning eyes
Of snow sighs downward , thine the swift
Thou shalt meet a cordial welcome .
The grief of parting must be bravely met ;
To give the glory imaged on his dreams :
A thousand eager coursers draw .
Or fell disease 's fever 'd rage to mourn ,
And the gathered power of my soul was moving
Simple honesty shows in vain
As if to prove saws knew what supper meant ,
( as it appeared in january , 1784 )
White memories like the snowflakes round me whirled .
Just reason based on valiant blood ,
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee ,
Cast him not with the common dead ,
And press the rue for wine .
Should speak by deep affection led ,
Fix moral fitness , and to god give rule ,
Nor bred in simple ignorance .
If i may gain such favour , as to gaze
The dreamy murmurs of the night steal on ;
She conjures to vision a cherub face ,
Wistaria blossoms trail and fall
The whistles blow forlorn ,
Gave me to face the orient . nor our way
She turns her vengeful mind ; whose skill she heard
Tour turban set with alien stars and sweet .
Bring sad thoughts to the mind .
Wind-scattered wreaths they go ,
The flickering flame , ascending , falling , dying .
To give his hand in reconciliation .
A kiss of horror gave ;
Your life shall go to battle with his bow ,
Shall go sounding down the ages --
To follow after and to make a vow , --
Flooded her and put out her fears .
Thou trumpet set for shakespeare 's lips to blow !
And praise to him who gave release .
My heart is bursting for his hail ,
And roses bound her auburn hair ,
" the very notes themselves reveal
Since dentists steal -- and fear no law .
And then a sudden thunder-clap broke loud ,
The terror of souls that are lost ,
Attracts them , follow ) , might ascend thus far
And a strange , wild dismayment it brings ;
And that proud toss ! -- it makes thee smile
With fell revenge , lust that defies control ,
Richly as a rainbow seen
Which at the final judgment thou shalt see . "
Bitter the winds that blow ,
Before thy heart had turned to stone ,
And on the summit rose a sacred grove ,
For fortune on his lot to pour ,
And cold the wind that wanders round
There did a thousand memories roll upon him ,
Man 's fate knows no tarrying .
And next those goads to evil deed apply ;
The farthest hem of silence shook :
So working to the point by devious ways
And foreign lands contain the mighty dead .
Or to the sway of empires had aspired ,
What that name might imply ;
Not what , but creeping sin went blue
Straightway draws his blade of battle ,
To run their course , and reach their goal ,
Warm sand flowed round him . blurts of crimson light
The tidings of their leaders lost
My shroud of white , stuck all with yew ,
That i had nodded , betrayed by slumber .
Unnumbered wounds they gave and took :
In reverence trained , to ráma cried :
Of her he sold , reluctant gave consent .
Drips the spring my boyhood knew .
Deep judgment with sagacity we find ;
Then a bankruptcy follows and nothing to pay ,
Though it have brought destruction on the world .
That holds the bones of marmion brave .
Pride points the path that leads to liberty ;
Shadows of cloud that swiftly pass ,
They stood , and earth 's foundations stay ;
The palace rising on his verdant side ,
Their breath upon the darkness passed .
With a magic charm are reflected
Are in their sleep confronted from without
The riotous waves that ride and hurl along
Take each step higher over the brute 's head .
In hatred far beyond what justice willed .
The slowly rising tide of the white flowers ,
Bring health to them and bliss renewed ! ”
These things have made me happy again
Of our own hearts have found no constant reason ,
An ancient tome came to my hands :
But it carries me sorrowing hence ,
Till each proud palace reeled and fell
Alcides , flushed with victory .
The faith they owe ; when earnestly they seek
Treading the dark with challenge and reply .
Genius of france ! pursue the chace
The whole universe indicates that it is good ,
Than painless void proceeding to no end . "
Souls seeming to return unto the stars ,
While my heart , if proudly swelling ,
And lives at last were washing away :
Or he whose virtue sighed to lose a day ?
As it swept to the grassy ground .
Haste let me shroud from painful light ,
In the crimson liquor swim ;
We reached the woods : no savage shout
But there went up a glad hurrah
And sees the brains that surge from his forehead ;
Whereon no human mercies fall ;
In doubt and dread no rest could find ,
Green for spent passion .
He wrapt him in religion .
Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will ,
Thine own hereafter shall be placed among them .
That , filled with love , i may become
It speeds through the shadows , dense and black .
The child 's expanding mind had ample seals
Two nights and a third passed over ,
He said , and forceful pierced his spacious shield :
Admittance found the portal masked ;
It greets honest toiling with open derision
Whose panic flitting chills the dark , and who
They quickly join 'd the fray , and loud arose
Let the income-tax be reduced :
Back to warm life its sleeper gave ,
Dying , to feel the same again ;
In thy strong refluence make us thine !
In life they mingled with its thousand waves --
Love that should help you to live ,
Changed hope and fear till fear took flight ,
Which struck with terror friends and foes !
While grieving in despair they sink .
That in his mother her it made prophetic .
Loud uproar hence , and rage of arms arose ,
" i seek the talisman which guards the free ,
His hands collect ; and darkness wraps him round .
That puts new glory upon mental wealth
For ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf
Sore wounds that none might take and live .
And if i still have let the occasion slip ,
To ecstasy the feeling grew !
" beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root .
Thus life ran away , so smooth and serene --
Whispered a dim foreboding ,
Give her earthly praise and homage .
What gloomy sadness darkened o'er his brow ?
A shape that hath not come to bless .
Unto the sound of the true words expressed .
Though banners here were for them spread .
All around my heart it flows ,
And through the grove one channel passage found ;
Only my heart makes answer . eager vines
His blood shall dim my spear . "
Your hands make me ache ;
A blush , a momentary glance , which brought
He answered not , but churchward went ,
With her fair face she made my heaven ,
And life and spirit came anew .
Mingle in soul as well as sound !
“ slain , those high towers attempting to defend ?
Disease , and sorrow 's weeping train ,
" that shows the sap of life within
A captious fool may feel offended ;
And still its perfume lingered all around ;
The sun sinks fast with the rising dew ,
That would set you higher in heaven , serve you
And heaven holds the key .
Give me the life that follows the bending sails ,
And it tore the hen to pieces .
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds .
Upon my brow the sweat-bead stands ,
Song , " follow a shadow , it
Waves that dip , and dash , and sparkle ;
The silk sail fills , the soft winds wake ,
Yet the sun shines ; the country green
That ever buckland built a theory on .
Through echoing skies the thunder pealed ,
A mountain goat resign ’d the shining spoil .
And dimpling smile their seeming fear deny .
The gates of sleep stood wide .
To leap from life and light , and find
So , till the judgment that yourself arise ,
The common prostitute she lately grew ,
Who live to fill the trump of fame ,
Their own neglect , each other 's safety sought ;
Which daintie odours round about them threw
The dardan prince put on a smiling face ,
Me an ' my lover , we fall out .
They bear the witness of things hidden ;
Like ancient sailors , still regard the coast , --
Wherein no fatal likeness should intrude
The plant i give through all the direful bower
And it put forth a wild beseeching cry --
To aid his hopes and give redress .
And memory in his breast awoke ,
The cloud in the west would bring foul weather .
Sent it with swift rotation like a globe ,
This happy house shall never fall .
Flags wave above the honored dead
For he applies his blood , in faith ,
They may vote and make laws ,
And made the organ moan .
What honour can in words or deeds be shown
But deepen the long night of bondage and mourning ,
Where she could relieve her burden .
And then you go straight to sleep .
That its joy grew his , and sprung
That about his ears did run ;
M ay showers bid famine flee .
The hours slid fast - as hours will -
Arise and flee ! shake off the vile restraint
They know where the fruit hangs the thickest
Ring through the world with loud applause ,
That saw its wrongs redressed --
She bore the patient sorrow of rain alone .
Into the wide stream came of purple hue --
That close with summer blossoms set ,
There , low he lies , in lasting rest ;
Screams , great tortured screams shake the dark canopy .
He acts with strict justice , her dictates pursue ,
Whose glory never waxes dim .
With what the rugged sojourn does allow ;
When now the flame had come unto that point ,
And i can not carry this battle ;
Of ocean . that retreat a goddess holds ,
_ i took a day to search for god ,
That touched the forest mold .
I sink back shuddering from the quest .
Therefore make haste and come along with me ,
With hateful blaze beneath the rising day ,
When smiling conscience holds the scales : }
This leads me on to tell for sport ,
We stem the flood , we ride the blast ,
So things in this fashion for eight winters stood ,
Where leaves hang yellow :
Of eve , whose eye darted contagious fire .
We wage a civil war . this name of peace
That fifty years have passed and gone
The last fond hope i leant upon ,
Then he hunts for strongest sinews ,
This , heaven in it doth bind .
Each one his countenance held downward bent ;
Shatter the pauses of the organ 's whanging ,
That saw it -- so , an hour yet :
And join me with the pure .
These in the bower had yielded all their charms ,
All feel the assault of fortune 's fickle gale ;
That we may throw dishonor on his name . "
That makes spring lovely ; there 's a sense behind
Such as may make the crowned conqueror quail ,
Of waves aegean breaking on her shores .
The waters rush 'd , the waters rose ,
Towards us came the being beautiful
Where a voice called , far and sweet ,
That shed perfumes , and whispering thus address ’d :
My restless hands hold fast the wheel ;
Last went the anchor of the wrights
And thus the hermit 's prophecy ran on :
Roved through the visions that precede the truth ,
I cast it far away in scorn ;
The leaves may fall beneath the winter 's wing ;
With thoughtless joy i stretch 'd along the shore
A spring there is , whose silver waters show ,
But take the way of utmost blessedness .
Unto the new creation , rising out
Or worn with anguish , that it views
Oh babylon , with wrath encompassed round ,
" an inquisition taken for the people
Then take things as god sends 'em here ,
Have found the fame your shores refuse ;
Let him not hope to measure back his course ,
Their flag to april 's breeze unfurled ,
And teach the selfish heart what others feel ;
Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended .
To both our souls is given --
A gay child that bears a white candle --
Unseen hands of spirits are ringing his knell ,
Some hold their duty to be mournful ; why ?
" behold me now to stature sprung ;
Seeking salvation from the power they served .
To a deep agony of acuteness wrought ,
In your skies to give light ;
Which own a secret dread .
The little naked feet that slipped
Yon moon that cleaves the gloomy pines
And i went and followed those seedy ones ,
Shut from the light of science and of truth
And from his hand the deadly cup hath sped ,
His sacrifice the king prepared .
A hand has been laid upon them all .
That beamed from the face of his lord .
Must fade and wither away .
It fell upon _ a little western flowers ,
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
I found in the county of connall the glorious
Of a white road snaking about a hill .
Are unrefreshing as the winds that blow
Never recall the words it said ?
The smoke of hostile cannon lies his way ;
Most beautiful , but held askance ; her mouth
The thing she came to beg or borrow ;
Or change admits , or nature lets it fall ;
A mingled echo gave ;
The state that strives for liberty , though foiled
While the hands of the twilight were weaving
When were the dice with more profusion thrown ?
To heap the shores with copious death , and bring
I dream as one that sinks thro ' passionate hours
That which it took not as a loan :
Truth urges us historians to relate ! ) --
And yet caught up by the surrounding choirs ,
In radiant armour , throwing wide the gates
Himself to sing , and build the lofty rhyme .
The civil way you 've got ;
In those freckles live their savors .
For in her eyes was burning such a smile
The sterner fates , to cross his purposes ;
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
Through moanings of forsaken night should go .
A stronger gust catches the cloud and twists
His instinct teaches , and with growing dread ,
From the incense-burner rises a delicate fragrance .
His soul was filled , first on the wandering stars
Ah , if that cry has reached her ear ,
Content were found soone in calamity ,
The saint or moralist should tread
The father , as the son came nigh ,
Where the spine joins it . not more furiously
No new god comes to spoil me utterly --
Now i have turned again to nature and freedom .
Mother 's eyelids droop and fall .
Did his desires still turn . but she a while
It hides a secret to the birds
God lives , and lifts his glorious mornings up
Can back a steed , or shake a spear ?
Which makes thee wonder ; and so purge the cloud
Imprisoned edges till the life-blood flows .
His pallet touched by love grew warm ,
Their way the waters from benacus take .
Heavy-hearted , long reflecting ,
Thus may the cloudy fates unroll 'd
Colour and sound and perfume speak to him .
Through all the years that went and came .
Then the flying columns follow .
And kindly thoughts o'er lordly pride prevail ,
( why comes summer when winter is nigh ! )
I followed afterward the emperor conrad ,
Those thin lips ever curling to a sneer .
Such bitter lees lie lower in the measure ,
More tears again than for myself arise ?
How tame each bird and beast we see !
It raised a brother from the dust ,
And truth shall own , some virtues they possess :
Its holding to rot where it fell .
But that which from these accents flows .
Which makes this job a wholesome thing .
Which way the ships would gladly go ;
And the cool stream , whose trembling surface shines ,
The pangs thy godhead could not hide , --
To vanish where the rapid waters run .
A soul went searching for its spirit mate ,
Send forth their melancholy moans ,
By this the roar of bitter battle came .
As loud it rang when , rending love apart ,
Moths knock the petals from the dropping rose ,
Once binds the soul in greasy fetters ,
Here , coffin that slowly passes ,
But time which none can bind ,
Aurora look 'd abroad , forth went the hounds ,
Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight !
There 's jack has made a wondrous marriage ;
The art of making money ; and he found
His shape and beauty made him proud :
It brings the nations to our marts ,
Our works are builded out of dust ,
O , may the lord make each of them believe
His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs .
Fancy from joy still wanders far astray .
Why should i hide my love from you ?
There no father 's welcome meet them .
And every smile on my cheek should turn
Sometimes the creature , who the power possesses ,
Or latin classics claim 'd his mind 's attention :
With rails i built for him a run ,
Thy days of freedom lost , and led away
Came as silent as the dew comes ,
His shoulders intercept the unfriendly rays :
The night wears on : - my thirst i quench
The kingdom which thy servant kept .
A watery gleam of malice played awhile --
But added colors to the world reveal 'd :
Give thy orders to thy servants !
Who show 'd a token of distress ?
Lo , the darting bowling orb !
What lies beyond us to complete our souls ;
One more bird 's song the air will hold ,
Still , brother , to my words attend ,
Too close to leave a space for walking .
To waylay the date-gathering negress :
O earth that sent upward
( where half new england came to gaze )
True love , long sought and found at last ,
Ravished with zeal his soul approached near
Which cutting off through hasty accidents ,
That given , received , renewed was the kiss ;
Or fort that i can make here ,
Of foaming death , wherein she caught the gleam
Or only made believe , i can not say --
But , burning , held me to the last !
Deep in the temple 's innermost shrine is set ,
Aerial arms and twilight dropping hair ,
And friendly spirit hold the feast aright . "
And at each other homely taunts they threw . "
First partings form a lesson hard to learn ,
Would quench the only lights that guide ;
Invested stood , and a dispute arose
The appetite remains , that this is ask 'd ,
The noblest presents that our love can make ;
Yet , yet my heart lies there
Sigh with thy cruel voice , that fills
Give us a song !
Which told how deeply he was hurt and pained .
And in his ears the music that makes mad
Exalter of the land that gave thee birth ,
She shuddering turned to read her fate
The cup of plenty running o'er ,
To bless the turf that wraps their clay ;
That grow from social codes , i see
How every " retreat " means a brief respite ;
Away the tear that rises here ;
None goes to warfare but with this intent --
That in their summer beauty kissed each other .
But they rowed , and made no progress ,
Men shall make mention of our roman toils ,
At the last their strength forsook them ,
" that new reporter makes the murray inquest
We take increased devotion to that cause
Venus , it seems , has sought to lead astray
The fountain in the basin plays ,
While stretched at ease you sing your happy loves ,
Our exeter stood forth to caper ,
In every heart find answering chords !
And lilith laid
New love to give and take ;
By hearth and home , your real danger lies .
To share the page that marks his fame , }
He ' stablished truth , or startled error ,
Take heed of what i say ;
Heard my complaint and made reply :
My mother gave to me , the deeds i did
How blessings brighten as they take their flight !
By dooming all corporate bodies to fall ,
The widows , while her eyes ran o’er ,
Can let the friendly in ;
When foes in battle round are pressing ,
Nevermore here shall the dark things assail them ,
At the tumult that it makes !
Long summer noons the winds forsake ;
And to taste the mead of combat . "
Until her heart felt pity to the core
She listen 'd with a flitting blush ,
Hear the cool lapse of hours pass ,
There now lie great heaps of rubbish ,
So did her virtue overcome my nature ;
That we should join the synagogue of satan ,
Only she ever sickened , found repulse
Parried or swallowed searching questions rude ,
With his war-club smote the doorways ,
Swaying the flowers with the wind of its passing .
Did tighten to the gasping throat .
Where peace sat smiling at the frowns of war .
Three errors there are , that forever are found
As their tall boughs lie trembling on the deep ;
The tatters drummed the devil 's tattoo . on
With its dark buds and leaves wandering astray ;
A fearful prayer my steps for ever stay 'd .
That unhappy plaintiff cursed ,
Answered in the words that follow :
Unfolds a tale which can but make it sell
A deadly silence reigned alone .
And left a flat dull waste of dreary pain ,
Of breaking my fetters if joy flew away .
And fed by recount of heroic deed ;
Where parted spirits meet again .
The cheek of matilda had flooded with flame .
For mine it is his bliss to share !
And the fairest hair the world has seen ,
Doubt not all will yet come right .
Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid ,
So back to the author his manuscript went ;
Cold winter storms lay standing corn ,
A wicked whisper came , and made
Each murmur from her lips that flows
Clouds sail over the distant trees ,
Cloud wrapt the stars ,
Quickly found he first good shelter
When in their filthiness they stand confessed .
The pace they go ,
On others , but takes all the shame .
On waves that shroud a thousand newly dead !
Which found a throne upon a juliet 's tomb .
To which the said spectacles ought to belong .
There one evening moved the princess
Softly , softly take thy place ,
And widowed queens move in the shroud of death
Should she pay thee no attention ,
Of bleaching bones to mark their path ;
My heart made , finding failure in its scope .
Out of his eyes flashed a consuming fire ,
As through the phantom fleet the message ran ;
A roll of thunder set the casements clapping .
And still the record stands ,
The holy book that tells me so .
Its good so mixt with ill we see ,
Giving virtue a new birth ,
They 've given their hearts away .
Now dimmed and gone ,
From the trunk he formed new pleasure ,
The maiden made a foolish vow :
Where the leaves and the ferns lay thick
And listen 'd to her breathing , if it chanced
To his authority , whose life was given
And lay their arms about the fields .
And in the west the circling clouds had spun
He could gain footing on the adverse shore ;
The mirth that shakes the beard of grain
The wanton snow flew to her breast ,
Then things will go round without a fiddle ,
My thoughts keep going far away
The only sounds which come upon the ear ,
Here i make oath --
Which momently put out the world .
Their hermit dwelling lay :
Behind me , where the tramways run ,
His hundred 's soon hit :
Dark midnight storms had roared and crashed among
Steeped in the thoughtful silence where it grows .
And from their pieces make anew thy mutilated
Wild fury made their eyeballs red .
To adoration moved unconsciously ;
And from infinity there fell a balm ,
From which no care can save ,
Will crown thy hope , or fix thy fear .
And a perfume round it hovers ,
And the cricket that quaintly sings ;
And out he put . and all way through
In this case might be laid
Loud laughter made the baron 's eyes grow bright
Her dark eye flashed -- she paused and sighed --
No mercenary bard his homage pays ;
And fix good-fortune on the dice .
Thy dew-bright eyes , whose flashing glance
Where the ripe clover drew the bees ,
" the angels pricked it to let it bring
On search where hope might fear to sound
With prayer sent up to god ;
A bitter mockery wore ,
Lest they should break the compact they had made .
Only their fire seems bolder , yielding light ,
Till tears bedimmed the creature 's eyes !
Swings slow its awful gnomon of red fire
Where love lies bleeding on the way .
Whose bellies swell with poison now .
Wavered , then staggered backward , hemmed by foes .
Oft the treasured impression renew !
I thought the worst had brought me balm :
Of scamps that ever cheered the devil .
My spirit flew in feathers then
The picture of good health she goes along ,
And terror , like a spectre , rose
All who are taking this dingy unrest :
Than those that shake mankind . happy is he ,
What valley echoed the response of jove ?
The lips of thunder muttered harm ,
That turns to iron bands when love is cold .
How otherwise they go my heart records ,
And horse and foot in mingled tumults rise :
Where the cold nymph sits in her oozy hair
When my wayward breath is flying ,
And humanity 's clamour , lost , lost ;
And in words like these expressed him :
His shadow fluttered on the pure white sands
Though you find old scars of pain ,
And the elephant with courtship falls
May arise with the gael
Of freemen rising for the right
A manor would but poorly serve my turn ,
With rainbow plumage fluttered through the air ,
Last night , when weary silence fell on all ,
Each crime that wakes in man the beast ,
He looks through life and only sees its end !
The weary wheel to a spinet turned ,
Spirit , substantial form , with matter join 'd
Does it drift , pale and forlorn ,
How love is fashioned in a maiden 's dreams .
Delights the flowers to lave ,
Or would he go as blind to buds
Though my temples burn with shame .
Penelope with which to make her glad ,
She took eternal fire that never dies ;
And fill the world with sadness .
How each the whole its substance gives ,
It held the copse in rivalry .
And here their tender age might suffer peril ,
With love like his together bound .
They themselves make the reel ,
Was loosen 'd , till he made them understand ;
Merely to show your worth ,
And take the shelter of her joyless land ,
Our double presence unified in thee
When men are come to mend their faces .
And i will have an image made for each ,
In death 's deep slumbers now are sealed ;
Rigidly , yet in settled calm , this realm ;
As guns redouble their fire .
Where the shadows of sin never rested ;
Shall bring us ever nearer ; day by day
The youth she loved then entered by her side ,
He rose and made his gift of kine .
Down the river were calmly pursuing their way ,
And flies their memory fast almost as they ,
Your fame , thus spread to distant lands ,
The bay that bids man moved of god 's desire
And in their tortured eyes i stand forgiven .
No more with presents her embraces meet ,
And the great bluff stands between .
And soft voluptuous couches breathed repose ,
Of those that make life lovable , -- increased
There only came to her forlorn
The lonely hours i give to dante 's page ;
With lips that trembled and trailing wings ?
Now that the clouds loom southward ,
The frost that kills the flowers .
Mankind are formed with different souls :
Which brought this judgment : so the youth was seized
Piteously ; far rang her wild lament .
Receive the law our god revealed ; accept
When the sick , bloodless west doth winding spread
While meadow and wood went by ,
Then she took up her burden of life again ,
And never meet a beam of light ,
To thee belongs a second golden reign ,
Now the old homestead is gone to rack ,
That will give me freedom and change of air ,
Walking where noble spirits lead .
But still as wilder blew the wind ,
The burdens of being on us weighed ;
The rosy bonds fell down from me
Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee ;
To join the blissful host .
And , what the men of this world miss ,
Or weight of silence ever brought to you
Sit there waiting till death should pass ,
All living things would bless and save ,
To make believe that thou art gone ?
Who can in reason then or right assume
But forever in sunlight went these two immortal ,
Mary that made sin cease ,
Fame is not silent , here in hope to find
And think the heavens respond to what they feel .
And blighted hearts are found
Trailing the slow robes of mourning ,
As the night when sleep is sped ,
In the strength the lord christ gave ,
Within those shades the terror felt ,
Of nature , and not fill the world at once
The year was plagued with instances of death .
Night fell -- and still she failed to come .
Loud as when pleasure hath knocked
And rise like miracles among the flowers .
To such a miracle of charms allied :
A sinful world to punish and confound .
Too keen the breathed honey of the rose ,
In a great fire i almost took for god .
And ravish 'd thus , it came to pass ,
Toward it springs the hapless maiden ,
Though it got 'em by the score ,
Their fellows snatch 'd them from impending fate .
True lovers puffing and blowing and springing on ,
I wrapped my kisses round its rest ,
Far to the east the haunted woodland lies ,
Listens , watches , takes no rest .
The temple so adapted to the god ,
That slides into the gold of burning eve
From the lake a cloud breathed upward ,
In mutual innocence our lives we led :
He spreads destruction , death and fear ,
So nature spreads her proffered treasures : such
Then followed fast those holy two .
And give me kisses three .
As thunder clears the atmosphere .
Take due refreshment , and the watch attend .
Finds no protection , lord , from thee ,
But man 's faded glory what change shall renew !
As argued by harvey , but saw confirmation
That peace which suffers and is strong ,
Gathers the sap that sings a merry song ,
't was passing rich , and few folks know
In the soothing thoughts that spring
And the red light glanced and gleamed
Inspire me with new confidence to build .
Reflecting , and reflected on his race ;
Followed by such a fierce alarm withal ,
Transcendence rayed the distant urn
That brought his bark to such a shore .
And gathers ground fast at the labourer 's heel
That is not mixed with doubt .
" the world shall never know its hidden pain ,
A month has fled to the months gone by ;
The flowers that to his eyes their charms disclose ,
In vain revived falls harold 's ruthless hand ;
And her torn fan gives real signs of woe .
Who join 'd pure faith to strong poetic powers ;
There to find the ancient wisdom ,
Mourning shall go down to the grave for thee --
Round his lips a smile was playing .
Hers teeming with the best ! "
No balm from the fountain of nature will flow
O strange and wondrous miracle , which sprung
Then passed for aye the creaking trains ,
Lightly and firm her footsteps fell ;
Down the dim river we float on forever ,
And as the hour drew near , the coward minds
Which the mad shepherd made .
He stands god 's guardian of ghostlands ;
The spring blew trumpets of color ;
They had been distanced by new-wedded brides .
Sometimes an animal , when covered , struggles
More bodies , sending them from out itself .
Thus addressed the ancient louhi :
One half the time of each was spent in praying
As calm from the heaving elements ;
Perhaps he confided in men as they go ,
The four good steeds the car that drew .
That the stars i may consider . "
But led by folly as a slave ,
To find the truth ; more difficult , more bent
Than those which come by sweet contingencies .
His bark sailed over the sunrise-sea .
The sun tells brightly in the sinless skies .
And like the sun , a shadow it may leave
If he left anything to charity ,
Out of the earth the poem grows
The injian ocean sets an ' smiles
A moment stops , lies then a hundred years ,
Her features spoke what joy she found ;
O no ! o no ! trial only shows
What though no credit doubting wits may give ?
Had taught the trampled heart to feel ,
Which gave some fears of revolution ,
But if that flower with base infection meet ,
In darkness the loud sea makes moan ;
Your states political to sprout and take
Then the haze lifted . bombing on the right
These borrowed glories would on him have shone ,
And broadway make one with that marvellous stair
And tell them that my strength is running out ?
The inexpressible hush of murder lay , --
With circling steps around him went ,
Through the sadness now there mingled
And the spell that bound me broken .
What the message thou art bringing ?
But still its wonted place the image kept ,
And a good south wind sprung up behind ;
Where that wise harper 's finger ran ;
While around it lie the shadows . '
And foemen in the battle tames .
Your heads you bow to power and pomp ,
They never felt what sorrow was ;
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell ,
That ever an heart like mine could engage .
The midnight phantoms feel the spell ,
And there went your opportunity .
As your birthdays come and go ,
That i in blindness wandered from my path ;
To bear the burden of a heavy heart , --
That wo n't show loyalty to their king ,
To what the eternal evening brings .
Will not there find peace of mind ;
Saint sylvester 's , the legend ran .
Closer round thee my heart 's affections twine .
What heart that bit of shrapnel broke ,
These words run rude ;
Beside the mystery that is hid within .
And we stay wondering . but there comes an hour
And civilized habits renumbered their days .
Shed sorrowful tears , until they did strike through ,
In fighting fields pursued and found their fate ;
Up to your haughty palaces may mount ;
Or as a pale shadow gone ,
And the beauty it wears will never grow old ;
And when th ' allotted quarter came ,
Where purgatory its true beginning takes . "
If i may gain such favour , as to gaze
Which added doubly to my former fear .
But the pope 's heart within him burned ,
Never flitting , that vision of mercy was sitting .
By giving him six months ' hard labour .
Give these vapor-baths new virtues ,
And thus acquaintance grew , at noble routs ,
The magic car moved on .
Now take my counsel , -- drink of wine ,
That rests not , nor refreshes . scarce awake
Lest i pour light upon thy slayer 's head :
* * o , eyes where glorious prophecies belong ,
And shall drive away the horror .
Above the steam that hissed and billowed about him
To be by fainter hearts withdrawn .
What greetings come there from the voiceless dead ?
The gentle voice was trembling , dim the eyes ;
And the grief which overwhelmed him
More than he made of life and death together ,
Fills the pale evening with wan hints of death .
Of grief approaching , the portentous sign !
That you give me no respite ,
He brings the seasons at his call ,
To mark the sweet flowers as they spring ;
Which to their corses came again ,
To-day in the cold north may meet ,
While day and night can bring delight .
But her eyes travel away from them :
Who formed our country 's laws ,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man ,
With his bloody crest erected ,
And there you pass , in happy dreams ,
There , while the crackling flames leaped high ,
But face it with a ready , cheerful glance ,
And leave us leisure to be good .
't is not to make the nations show
What the message did reveal ,
And gently they stir his sleeping soul ,
From paths of truth he never strays ,
Old rome consulted birds ; lorenzo ! thou
We can but give our tears --
Oh , but the woods show such delicate greens ,
" who turn to a trade her cause divine ,
For the wind takes the may :
They went to scale and -- cruel fate ! --
June drew unto its end , the hot bright days
And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise ;
And the birds kept tune to the songs which ran
The black injustice that puts out the sun :
The lists are set , the galleries raised ,
And rent the veil of darkness from the soul .
And so the eternal chase goes round the world .
Then sorrow , touched by thee , grows bright
To the boys she gave one final wave ,
To have the death by suicide made known .
Are those , which make thee beat thy wings below
Wild though the dwelling seem , thus rising fair ,
She sleeps , but her rosy lips still move ,
That led through the deep forest .
Such sunshine seemed to glitter through his veins
Regions they pass 'd , the mightie regencies
When high , to catch the cool night-air
Joy so seldom weaves a chain
Upon my heart this deeper shadow lay :
Astonished and made mad with ecstasy
Dark the clouds that hurried by ;
On the bliss that comes with dreams like these !
What sound thy gulfs of silence hold !
The dying sun 's illumination .
And plunged in bitterest grief to-day
When we erred , they gave him pity ,
Divine pelides , with compassion moved .
A thousand twisting coils writhed where it lay ,
In april , when the turning year
Found these songs so wild and wayward ,
Where no disease reigns , or infection comes
To grasp the spirit of medicine is easy :
Ye mountains vast , whose heights the heaven sustain ,
Yet in our hearts our kingly worth is laid ;
If there were added but one drop of bliss ,
The maiden gave the ring she wore
God 's _ rainbow hangs in colors bright _ ,
For it had lost its shape and shine ,
Whomever thou hast followed of the two
Where rust and cobwebs bind the gate ,
To gather fresher forces for defence .
That leads to god .
Too many tears for lovers have been shed ,
Let me not see the anguish of my child
The chords and break one chord !
When fortune should them home with conquest bring ,
Can mortal strength presume to soar so high !
How many blessings fall , and how much woe .
And dreams went along her veins , and scattering clouds
As his sword strikes men to death .
The sigh that 's breathed for one to hear --
With the long , strong arm which reaches far ,
With fruitless labour , clara bound ,
Enjoy my love and take thy rest .
It fills the church of god ; it fills
The prophet , who my future woes reveal 'd ,
Indeed they took to frolic more and more ;
Till lengthened on to faith , and unconfined ,
Yields the pure vision passionately sought ,
Ever the wild malignant poised and panted to slay .
Holding his misery for gain ,
The ghastly words from vellum told ,
And spring never passes away .
For to-day to feasts is given ;
Can see no evil in a play ;
The night was hung with silence
His dam held that the quiet made all things
As she leaned down my kisses to meet .
That he seemed hardly fitted to waddle about .
Not herod but an angel leads .
That holds the melancholy skies and kills
Here mingled vines that downward shadows cast ,
For round the temple rolled the clang of arms ,
Only in far-fetched metaphors appear ;
That to the watery element they owed
A hero 's honours let the hero have .
With this he drives men 's souls to hell .
Did not quite fill the trumpet of his fame ;
To grief give birth ,
Gives the last human interest to his heart .
He knows , who gave that love sublime ;
For love helped my heart to read
That could not find in years or tears relief ?
Unthought before , or fix a former flaw .
For thy lost bliss sing but one parting wail ,
Whom pleasure 's flowery wreaths can bind ,
By grief distracted there she could not stay ,
Their fortunes must flow in one channel at last ,
The sickles gleam , until the darkness weaves
Against them toughly whilst that nation stood ,
Mean objects , worthless of their love , pursued :
Who for three hundred dollars take a part
But this was hot and dry ; it came
The patriarch sought no laban 's distant well ;
The holy man made answer to this :
Which made them all to smile
And sparkling fires that shot from either eye ,
I breathed a prayer that she might be
A sign to maim this order which i made .
Make good thy liberty through civil war . "
The waters rush 'd , the waters rose ,
And golden tulips , goblets holding the rain --
I really thought my time was come ,
What raging fury or what baleful star
O tear-wet eye that scans the sky
He scorned the sage advice i gave ,
And grateful clusters swell with floods of wine ;
Than take the fortress of a hemisphere .
Many a lovely dream i 've given ,
Scorning what nature doth in bounty lend .
Sounds , too , had come in midnight blast ,
As heaven had lent her all his grace . "
Unfold the meanings of the catholic faith ,
They mount -- how short a voyage brings
Laughter in her eyes ran wild !
The little treasure god has given .
Edging with fire the shifting fumes ,
On the south-going breezes shall deepen and grow
Tears fell , when thou wert dying ,
Is center , yet extends to all , so thou
Yes , as the seasons come and go ,
Will the bud blossom where the frost has sped .
The herbs lie withered , and the birds that move
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
That lay in the house that jack built .
The clear brown pools stand simmering in the sun ,
By memory 's magic to thy lip are brought .
Welcome to grasp of friendly hands ; to prayers
If it be fixed in love 's decrees ,
They break no commandments , and do all their duties
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell ,
Of which that golden eye which clears the skies
Had grown suspicion 's sanctuary , and chose ,
Listening to hear its softened sounds arise .
Countless had been the slain , whose bodies fed
His body with the current idly swung .
Legends that ran from mouth to mouth
Where titan rises , where night hides the stars ,
Ere yet the bee hath gleaned one wayward drop
Cold fear can paint , or wildest fancy feign ;
The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb .
And busted into tears .
Flung from his house went forth the youth
Casts her shadow on the floor .
This is no tournament where cowards tilt ;
Which comes when nature man deserts for art :
And ants and serpents creep and crawl
And sad , it creeps from tongue to tongue ,
" open thy bosom to the truth that comes .
The rest lies rooted in a trojan shield . "
Six thousand winters make her heart a-cold ;
Beyond the sunset lying low ,
The autumn of the third year came and went ;
As calves encourage and take steps to tame ,
That it made the devil start and stare
The laugh that left lips more serene ;
And longings one can not smother ,
From all her caves , and back resounded death !
Sith purest angels fell to be impure ?
And longing arms around her neck he cast ,
That saw saint catherine bodily ,
To some a hunger that will not depart .
And made the sinews crack .
And afflicting moans she fetches ,
The unhappy banner francis saw ,
There rises something white .
The moon she hides her sickly eye .
But this she quelled and forced a tranquil look
Could some discord be adjusted --
His mistress ' portrait decked the wall ,
Then answered in a voice that made him quail :
That , dying ever , find no death ;
The hero bore , his peril quickly seen :
It finds an echo in the sweet
" now i make thee truthful answer ,
Those who in god securely stand ,
Impetuous , from conflicting vapours sprung ,
And wakes remembrance of great things gone by .
The amber sunshine lies ;
The sculptor will carve out an angel for me .
The nimble one is made for fun ,
And the turf bank wears with glee
For soft is the song my paddle sings .
The wild wind follows and plays the lover .
No richer incense breathes on earth :
And laid the blight of his cold hand
The leather flew at pace immense
When starting onward went the dogs ,
Still there the sweetest charm is found
Just as fate or fancy carries ;
And when the ball-night came at last ,
My soul arises moaning in the night .
My fancied good , and brought substantial ill !
To bridge with faith the sunless tide !
My darkness enlightened , the true light must shine .
And her within that inner cavern drew .
Of a love they dare not name ,
And finds too late that men betray ,
Swift accusation brings ,
Now lifts an anxious and expectant eye
Its kingdoms melt into one mighty realm --
Or sin provoke from fate , than this .
A doctrine that the priest had oft expressed ,
Or doth the soul hold converse spiritual
Thou seest the white seas strike their tents ,
And prayed for , and wherein at times he caught
Mine once emerged three times a year ; --
The storm came on before its time :
't is to bind the bleeding heart ;
To find a king their freedoms to support :
Your hard heart breaks the vow ;
And so of singing get the goodliest share ;
Where lives of hermits we may lead ,
Cry , as they trace the meteor bright ,
Terror of falling now oppressed me sore ;
And drop their offspring on the earth .
Which does not feel of love the glow .
Others in virtue placed felicity ,
Of beech and aspen ere ye slip thro ' ,
When nations smile o'er battles won ,
Less swift an eagle cuts the liquid skies ;
Black shapes from out the corners steal ,
In deserts makes its prey ;
They were piercing unknown regions , they were crossing nameless
My soul in the end is tired ;
That made me think what i had done .
Neglect to tell of god 's rich grace .
Speaking or asking thou broughtest me sorrow ;
The more it feels of pleasure and of pain .
The barns that once held yellow grain
To turn him to the city whence he fled .
Who made songs erewhile of thy shame ,
There long time it lay , all unmolested :
That raised their country to this blaze of fame :
In careless quiet , and secure of war .
In happy play where the gulls sway ,
Then a vast breathing silence took the plain .
And all things are made young with young desires ;
Should make their onset ere his shaft could reach
By bearing much , make fortune frees
The gamesome wind among her tresses plays ,
Would rouse an apoplectic passion .
As it flowed of old in its fated track .
Though distant and far severed -- but thy son ,
Let me face westward as my sun goes down .
Thy bridal morrow by thy servants sped .
Nor kind mate , bound by holy vow
And i make answer to my haughty dead ,
The day of sorrow comes , too long delayed ,
And the white fantails sidled on the roof
He raised the princes as they pressed
I ’d follow this music wharever it went .
And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly ,
The armies fade , the lustre dies .
The whole world like the spinning flakes of snow .
And made my flesh creep as i wandered on .
Sharp battle-cry flung back to earth ,
Whatever it creates and nature makes . "
He talked till the mocking bird felt secure ,
The seed that they had garnered in their hearts ,
A poet caught as he was journeying
A woman set about with dreams and spells ,
With lips that tell the strangest stories
And nature yearly took delight ,
And feebly there it stood , recovering slow .
And in a rage pluck out his eye ,
To meet my griefs with less concern ,
Of crimson lay , as that which softly falls
By terror follow 'd , his own dauntless son
Poor edward showed his grief :
We 'll cover love with roses ,
The love i bear thee surging through the rhyme
I 'd try if any pleasure could be found ,
To take the labour of any ryche or pore
Ill understood , which there is shining through .
Nor ever leave my sychar 's margin cool .
I waged no war with bedlam or the mint .
But what companionship can take their place ?
There comes a sullenness of heart
With the selfsame sunlight shining upon her ,
And left a scar that does even now remain .
My love for the lack shall atone .
Beyond our tents the sands stretch level and far ,
Hath landed all his followers who survive
In the great master 's steps went she
By the damp chill that crept among his hair .
Whitened the hair , made life a wondrous dream ,
Which made my tears run wild ,
And not a rent made by the gale !
Duke naimes feels pity overflow his heart .
Who wove coarse webs to snare her purity ,
Then saw what darkness veils our earthly day
He covered up with what came afterward ,
Whose swelling tears in dewdrops fell
Out of the past there rises a week -
Ere foreign fashions cross 'd the tweed ,
Adown her cheeks the tears ran fast :
For me he yields his noble life .
The devil made a reeve for to preach ,
And beds by strangers wrought ;
Were lost in study . all my tutor knew
What hope remains for thee and me . "
With their weapons charged with the lightning ,
With filial passion overcharged is this !
Of that combustion quivered an effulgence ,
That seeks to reign alone ;
Their faces almost touched as they talked ,
That i could fancy heaven shining through .
Why make of tom a dullard ,
And i would recommend you in prison for to throw
No more an exile fed on empty hopes ,
Things change their titles , as our manners turn ;
I 've taken notice uv this flo ,
Before i found that all things beautiful ,
Should have restrained his hate . a treason foul
Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old
Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
From hopes cut down across a world of fears ,
Fancy from joy still wanders far astray .
Did hold the earthly under such control
Unto their innocent wings should virtue add ;
The gusty blossom , that tosses and swings ,
Since a fine boy upon their care was cast .
The wounds his hurtling arrows dealt .
His conscience felt an hell :
Baby now must go to sleep .
Each life unfulfilled , you see ;
Was fanning the flame you had set alight .
We pieced our thoughts into philosophy ,
And when she asked what turn the sickness took ,
But he will note who knoweth all ,
Till we lose all measure of pace ,
Sugríva spoke with burning sighs :
The dull neglect of days to come
And pulling for the middle span , we drew
Would try to save those led from god astray ,
And timid hinds took warning ;
We still shall find uncertainty suspend ;
Our way we held , more rugged than before ,
Faithful shall my heart remain .
To tell the thoughts of eternity .
Clad like the angel gabriel , proclaims
But of the years that have passed by .
And the young child gave this answer :
His other hand takes dull gray sand
With all dainties the world could boast .
Let amorous fools in love-sick measure pine ;
Of light night wind comes laden with the scent
There held in holy passion still ,
Their names bring back old mornings , when the docks
The stream revealed to men by leto , bride
Or weep the wounds her bleeding country bore .
As much as nature fashioned thee to feel . "
For his suspicion to its source she traced ;
Those eyes , they shone so vivid with remembrance ,
My soul will sing a little song ,
Softly she walked with eyes cast down ,
And decreed laws ; and she the first that gave
Of erin 's hosts in wrath combined ,
To blow the reek from them .
May a thousand blessings come !
Which hangs out death in one eternal night ?
Loud as the shriek of winds that madly blow
Her married arms embrace her pregnant breast .
For whom each face held promise
Nearer the noise of fighting rolled ,
My eyes make pictures when they 're shut : --
The wheel goes round with a right good will ,
Give them brisk onset . then shall it appear
Take pattern by the fools who learning shun ,
To a deeper blue than a flower could hold .
For fame to thee has come unsought ,
In the black breast that met me there .
The roads look up to holy cross ,
Every wind that stirred the leaves
That lends a pang to lovers ’ woes ,
I had gone on unseeing , to the end
Yet to capture the creature made shift ,
Shall but link us , heart and heart ,
Make haste , and take her home , and bring
Making the star seem silver streak 'd with gold .
Down hastily he sprung from selle ,
She took his lady also in affection ,
From the river winding clearly ,
He spoke , and fondly gazing on her charms ,
They give and take sweet colour and sweet scent ;
Peace and plenty bring the strangers . "
The bloody harvest brings but little gain :
And each will hold his tenure old
And sorrow hath made my very heart pale .
He comes here to bear witness to the crime !
Northward of ossa thou shalt touch the lands
She rent the tresses of her golden hair .
Broadening as we cleave the dark ,
But as winter followed winter
Now three weeks space to thee will i give ,
The tumult and the shouting dies --
Rich gifts of joy is strewing ;
And if that sunnier hour should shine ,
Thou shouldst have made her mercy more .
Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown
Even to the ships will bring the battle now .
To make thy maids and self free mirth ,
Her distress would leave us rueing :
We follow , victorious
And let him feel that mercy now
When we regard the record of god 's will ,
In aimless , wayward curves it ran ,
And , oft in churches breathing fragrance ,
What sorrows yet may pierce me through ,
He tries to make believe he dreams :
Yet no new sufferings can prepare
There waste the mournful lamp of night ,
On a companion 's jaw his hand he laid ,
For we will deal with thine and thee
Honor the smiles displayed ,
Now give me a little kiss ;
Which nothing but monkeys can dwell on ;
So comes the captive soul into desire ,
Was made for caesar , but for titus too :
Pleased , for christ 's promises never can fail ;
But gave its hand to beggared intellect ,
I leave this light ,
Whose nature well this riddle will detect ;
And gives herself to his desiring eyes .
O'er the white path shall bound and play
Then poor and lowly stood evander 's home .
Or favor gave or sought .
Break through on the waves ' unrest ,
Love like the poet , whom it teaches , where
The only mischief was , it came too late ;
The years went on .
As fate or prowess might the day decide .
This good advice applies to you , young godfrey ,
Here , gloomy night assumes a darker reign ,
Grew mute to hear ; as her song rang clear
Which monster made it first and next a prey .
( the sunlight dies upon the open sea ) .
If she 'd had a boy , i bet ,
Brought down to this , and all her loveliness .
Yet from the deadly conflict flinched they not ,
Something has gone from your smile , sweetheart ;
How to meet each changing season .
And he spoke the words which follow :
To the wide heavens directed , many said --
The spireless church stands , plain and brown ,
She moveth , making earth afraid .
Pregnant with plagues , and shedding seeds of death ,
Noons like these she rose ,
Cleaving the silence with a wail ,
In steadfast gaze transported at the view :
For such , he left his heaven ?
Though years rolled on and outward sight grew dim ,
In dread accordance rose their dismal joy .
And now the torch of truth is found ,
And there lay them safe and sound ;
Through fragrant meads the pathways lead .
Of cold olympus ruled the middle air ,
But made the desperate passes when he smiled .
May hints of good instruction find .
The very clouds which veiled the heaven they sought
And he spoke the words which follow :
Forth from her maidens came the bride ,
And to augustus they so spread the flame ,
He gives to range the dreary sky :
To chilling fear that changed his face :
Sobbing as if a heart-string broke
Counsel took he to restore them
And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom ,
Where sunbeams through green branches play ,
Thy streaming tears no more can move me ,
Old civilizations pass , the new come on .
Who share the seasons to devour ;
My muse dow scarcely spread her wing ;
Proudly this heritage maintain ,
And as his rage him led and fury hot ,
I found myself turned violent , with hands
Thy mornings showed , thy nights conceal 'd ,
The stars looked forth to teach his way ;
Four-and-twenty years he reckons .
And strengthen it by beauty 's right divine ,
Even from thyself thy loathsome heart to hide ,
And unction that he puts into the melody ,
Merely to show your worth ,
Nature hath painted her a proper brown --
But thy strong hours indignant worked their wills ,
Scoffer , behold what gratitude we bear :
The sun went down . she slowly left her seat
Or bend their steps upon the summer morn
When he his nectar and ambrosia took
Where forlorn sunsets flare and fade
Was life till her sweet soul came --
Bring help , bring comfort
December will bring .
Hunger of hopeless things pursues
Fashioned to lead where strife gives way to strife ,
Another 's not more quickly touched by fear ,
When night shall close around the funeral room .
The hole churche is troubled by theyr outrage
Frenzy hurried the chant , frenzy rattled the drums ;
These had seen movement , and heard music ; known
Till god shall turn the world over
When imaged to my soul his sorrows rise .
And all that did then attend and follow ,
As your health or comes or goes ;
To bear the tidings of our fate to troy .
The voice of the people touched the heaven ,
Making it less a worship than before .
Of sea-birds swept before the gale !
Out of my veins and gone to bring new life
The human , that which minstrels keep ,
While home she kept to brood on misery .
And so i kept my counsel , for i knew
Their hundred hats they raise !
Back came the yelling shrieking chase ,
Of worlds on worlds that form one universe .
Streamed the pleasant sunshine ,
You have n't got the whitest hope
When men will break promise they speak
What dangers thou canst make us scorn ;
Rare faces , lovely , lifted and alight ,
On a strong wind of morning streamed wildly before ,
His fiat laid the corner stone ,
What feign 'd submission swore : ease would recant
The winds their perfume bring .
It fell in the dusk of the night
Ours for a little time we hold :
Where hearts are steeled and furious forces sweep .
And terror i bring to you .
Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall ,
There me the gods kept twenty days , no breeze
The hour when they assailed this last retreat .
With lotus comfort , feeding all your veins .
And the press groaned with licensed blasphemies .
From the clouds dropped down the honey ,
Unchanged , on changing tides and shifting sands .
Sighs rest thee not , tears bring no ease ,
Moves as the music leads ;
The graver power experience brings was seen ;
With desperate pride he wrestled with his pain
The race soon run , the goal soon won ,
And show its vileness by a holiness .
Of orpheus , here do lodge his muse again .
Love , while the sweet thing laughs and lies ,
That word had held when yours , for you ,
And , seen through friendship 's atmosphere ,
Encircle her i love and sing her into peace ,
Life goes crooning , faint and fain ,
Comes strong and lusty at the close of day .
Each shifting scene , some patriot hero trod ,
And passion loosens all the limbs :
Be comforted through all the years to come , --
It 's leaving thee , my bonnie mary !
As darksome clouds that pass away ,
But soon philosophy came to my aid ,
In one brief sentence lies the riddle 's key ,
The air dripped with a golden balm .
All thought in its mysterious folds ;
Whom life has humbled and subdued ,
A record may to future days remain .
The primrose for a veil had spread
Soft went the music the soft air along ,
Him who makes all worlds rejoice .
As though a tongueless nightingale should swell
Her eyes are sapphires set in snow ,
And white-haired phoenix followed on with these
And gareth overthrew him , lighted , drew ,
That set my spirit to swing on such a thread
It went and came , --
My very breath henceforth i hold
Rebellion crouch 'd , and trembling own 'd him lord
And would work no evil with them .
Answered in the words which follow :
In thee his features and his form i find :
So took i in child-innocence ,
The good ship lies , by little waves caressed ,
They grasp the lines , while all their faces glow
But there rose a shout and a wild hubbub
All eyes are strained to catch the joyful sight ,
They see , nor understand the joy they bring .
Pine-trees show its fires ,
Therefore let fortune turn her wheel apace ,
This fills the heart with amorous desire :
Toward him i turned with such a shame inspired ,
And arabi found 't was useless labor ,
Gives thee to make thy neighbour 's blessing thine .
They set a combat them between ,
By taking refuge in his prejudice ?
In the land where the dead dreams go .
A full conception , and brought forth with ease .
Ambition , cruelty , strife piled on strife ;
But when divinity comes ' cross me ,
To such what ’s given god himself doth get .
Nor stand for welcome at your gothic door ,
Until love bade it spread its wings and soar .
Which like their wives our fathers took
Yet follows a fainting and a foul collapse ,
" they gets it pretty hot ,
She murmured the holy name it bore ,
To god alone belongs by right ;
And make of italy a nation -- dear
When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust :
Of the labour that moves the world ;
Here on the rocks that take the turning tide ;
That snowy neck , whose matchless form sustain 'd
As the arab seeks at eve ,
Which draws the sight thereto
Alas , time stays , we go ;
The holiness we trace
How dearly words want power to show ;
And pleased away went hop , hop , hop .
Song , " follow a shadow , it
Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes ,
Love gave her courage , love exiled fear ,
All things were moving ; as his hurried feet
But on the frosted hedges ' lifted spear
The madness of that love most men pursue
To raise these garden ghosts of memory ,
In this dark place , so mute my tread .
The culprit whom they hold aloof , --
That earth to earth must go to dwell ,
Which stirred their hearts to discord and debate .
There appear 'd some inscrutable flaw in the plan
Before the stars have left the skies ,
Gama returns thanks to god
But in vain my tears i strew .
To thee the note i raise ,
Late in the evening the mist it descends ,
The sheriff made john good cheer ,
The days went by like shadows ,
Each bound the other 's crucifix -
Of midas , which his greedy wish ensued ,
Its bony roots clutching around and across ,
And thoughts that once wrung groans of anguish
Doth human worth mount up ; and so ordains
Cremated him . no pain he felt .
Then the maiden 's self made answer ,
Had entered into rest .
From those eternal circles we departed .
Strong of purpose , you took your stand ,
When heaven and hell get mixed . though conscience
From burning windows came a shout ;
The sun is down and drinks away
Of his free bounty , who had made them apt
Here from attack the emperor makes assure
The cudgel in my nieve did shake .
But he gives it the gender of life ;
The sweets of love are washed with tears .
Round about which the primal wheel revolves , --
Answered in the words which follow :
Toward the truth , drawn gently by his teaching ,
By which men bear the fasces to the feast
In few brief verses who therein is laid .
Since i have learned love 's shining alphabet ,
Eastward , it leads through cultivated fields
Still as aurora ’s ruddy beam is spread ,
And toward that point their way pursued .
Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights ,
The british thus united might express ,
Tender thoughts her glances fill ;
It showed not the splendor of colors
Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses ,
Where first is found the last ward of the city
And take the harmless folly of the time !
That has the name of treason -- which will serve
Until thine hour comes . immortal flower thou art !
To the artist that had made it
Around what focus their ellipse is drawn ,
And dance me downward where my doom is sealed .
May with thy praise resound .
The little cloud returned below ,
Softly the sand steals slowly by ,
And of this moment ; hither turn thy thoughts ,
Filling the room with their fragrant scent .
And called upon the summer 's name ,
That told of other days .
To meet with unrelenting hate
When first i met the world a vision came
The dreamer whose dreams come true !
Love hath his meter too , to trace
A tear to brim your eyes ?
Are bound by justice and religion to please ;
Sails turned to clouds , and slowly westward rolled
Who fog her tarnished honor feel ,
How vain the world had grown to be !
Then came the fight at compiegne ,
From soulless matter processes that served
A pleasant life it offers us :
To pass their judgment , and to give advice ;
The river slips through its silent bed .
And , take which road i may ,
That is each round shows more divinity ,
And , flowing , carry virtue . far below ,
Still bearing murderous madness in his heart .
Above my head but bears my power ,
Hath my courage moved ;
We killed our love , we took its life away
The light that shines comes from thine eyes ;
Like bursting bonds the wind responds ,
And other things give rare delight :
The bay to the palace she bore the lover .
And labour made the rugged soil a plain ,
Another took the rod of power ;
Each moment , flowing to eternity ,
Blinded i groped -- you gave me sight .
Yet i got no fear of an outlaw steer
Th ' ethereal people ran , to hear and know
Had found a voice whose human tone
So meanly passes , that all other lots
So to the year 's first altar step i bring
With marshalled ranks is lingering on the plain ,
Seas that restlessly aspire ,
Earth and the sky obeyed , things small and great
And some make war with humble prayers , and
And quench the animating fire ,
To meet death 's hands at his heart .
Not free , what proof could they have given sincere
To meet ye , mighty were the love that sought
And every sparkle shivering to new blaze ,
Which raising to her luminous , lantern jaw ,
Cheerful people may glide along gleefully .
No yearning gold would whisper to the scythe ,
When he railed at gosh for its foolish choice .
A thousand years away have rolled ,
Meantime their licence uncontroll 'd i bear ;
See what pre-eminence our merits gain !
Cast eurydice pallor on all we love .
Now at last i feel that living
Which when she viewed , a vision fell
Midnight had already passed by ,
Those eyes with bridal beacons shine ;
That years my fading charms betray .
But some were sad , and felt no mirth ,
To stem the sacred torrent .
For him they loved and ever held most dear .
And a cold fear ran shivering through my blood ;
But shame and anger vanish 'd when they saw
Half is mine , although i follow ;
For it lives to comfort sorrows ,
Or bring upon them other cataclysm
Sorrow was swallowed up ,
She gathered now is fading ! hour by hour
Love , that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize ,
And in my breast there flamed fierce anger ,
And the horizon widened , in his heart
As the spirit song came pealing
Within himself , and found no rest ;
Which heaven to gaudy day denies .
So , looking into the eternal light ,
Upright and firm i stand on a star unstable ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
From many stars this light comes unto me ;
A heart that can feel for another 's woe ,
Then nature folds its wardling to its breast .
The goddess said , and sullen took her place ;
As the gibbering secrets pass ,
Leading to sorrow and untimely death .
Hid it with honey-words that win you
That make italian flowers so sweet and fair ,
In gothic pride , it seems to rise !
Armies that go reeling by , --
And wild sounds rise from beaches harvestless ;
Have come my sacrifice to view .
Yet many a soft hand passes by
" better -- unless we hope that grief is thrown
Then , by his grief to frenzy wrought ,
The oak-trees shouted as it passed ,
The nightingale that on the branches sang ,
Of clear cold water winding underneath ,
Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw ,
And do not look for flaws ?
We saw thine eyes break from their east
" go on then . "
The troubled breast which rage had filled .
The flag that goes the world around
Through roaring deserts of embattled death ,
As the kindly sunshine thaws the snow ,
Let all men draw to thee
A glory lingering on .
Th ' inverted pyramid can never stand .
Whom men make monarch when he should be slave .
And thou hast reached his feet ! glad wave ,
The wonder of all eyes that look upon her ,
And where the ammer winds its silvery way ,
Shine upon my lowly grave ,
And there it stands unto this day
Then shall the skies thy soul receive . ”
But answer makes the lord in stern denial :
Their small masts bending to the inland gale ,
Waste youth in occupations only fit
May peace come never to his nest
A troop , and christians that pursued the same .
Whose cloudy thoughts let fall an inward rain
Resembling , straightway in its place arose .
Still strikes the ear one darling tune ,
Give thy fair spouse evil treatment ,
Be very prey to pain and sorrow 's sword .
Of flower-soft words that kiss and cling ,
He needs not thus admit of rivals , when
Days passed ; each morning saw the maiden stand ,
Nor brake and gave small cakes of beaten meal
Taking the form of slow precipitation ! "
And looking to the joy that lies before us ,
Millions that stand in arms , and longing wait
That ca n't turn out so !
That heaven had raised to grace this bower .
Straightway with downcast mien it shed
Things that are made to fade and fall away ,
To rock the cradle of reposing age ,
It wavers to a rose .
More near and deep , domestic woes succeed ! '
As clouds possess their native heaven ?
Wrapped his soul in voiceless sorrow
Good ! she hath found rest ;
And he strove his grief to smother .
When the clock struck the hour for retiring ;
Gently withdraw thine eyes --
Then die , content if they have struck one stroke
And bear the chastening strokes of god . "
That scatters blight in early spring ?
Whom darkness still will cover ,
Though fled the clouds of fifty summer skies ,
" the autumn days have all passed by , --
Some sunk to beasts find pleasure end in pain ;
The strain of comfort first to thee would flow ,
All day thy wings have fann 'd ,
Let my will impel thee seaward . "
Wise nature governs with , and by
Beyond compare the son of god was seen
Adopted some , none got by theft ;
The dane-king so fitting an answer returned :
Each contest -- here a victory crowns the end
While severn stream goes out to sea .
But beauty the god of the world still remained .
Is come our guilty lives to take .
Has been fanned into a flame
Transport , to tempt the dangers of the war .
Not a spar that comes to grief !
The spirit still will make its moan .
A prize that passeth to and fro ,
That gave us wormwood , while we shudder
To stir the night breeze with your dearest name !
Left a message for his weary soul .
Till not a note of melody remain ! --
Then turned the greeks to craven flight ; all feet
And raise in human hearts a heavenly flame .
This word . i know not if ulysses wore
Have set into the sea of sleep .
Give to the father praise ,
No timber cut for thee its downfall groan ,
Within the tent , a flare gave blowing light .
His sins for to assoil .
Have lighted up and led his age ,
Hacks us thus cruelly , slivering again
He fell asleep when in the century 's skies
Alone moves , pulsing in pooled air , that shakes
Which one alone brings most delight ;
Steam-like puts full-speed to sea ,
Saw that which made his heart with rapture shake .
The tears of rapture fell . ( 356 )
My faith and hope in god alone shall stand ,
And those that feel its fearful wound
Grim fiends who cross his track !
The wind may shout as it likes without ;
Wherein she suffering , all her spirits languish ,
That set hir half so weill .
Tear out his cursed heart without remorse ,
Nerves of life and veins that leap ;
And this addition with such gems was bound
To what base depths apostasy can go ;
And understood by what is made . one god ,
They seem like souls when life is gone ,
The stone courts stood ; hot streams poured forth ,
Those upon two wings that raise them ,
A tender little love that sighed and smiled
But , to form an excuse ,
Which he occupied when
But when he found that he must fight ,
Lured from a forest for the sea to bear --
The fire is come in my green wheat ,
The breeze that now is rising fast ,
That can by sympathy impart
" deep tulips dash 'd with fiery dew ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
That comforts my heart and makes strong .
Had granted to the pair a single greeting .
And take what daylight shows us for the truth .
Tears standing in their eye ,
One moment lives that melancholy trance --
Gives even affliction a grace ,
But now , when reason has assumed her throne ,
That gave me all those millions !
Made by thyself thy mighty form arose ;
Beauty maddens the soul like wine !
This was regarded as a religious ceremony , and therefore
Shall feel , if only thou be near ,
A page where time should hesitate to print age ,
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand .
" these tears her answer speak ! "
Whose smile can make a poet , and your glance
Thus god and nature linked the general frame ,
Great dreams have faded and been lost ,
And ask how you fell asleep ? --
While scenes of woe rose anxious in my breast ,
Sealed the rosy lips of the mountain sprite .
He finds his fellow guilty of a skin
Yet of the present , then employed the stage .
Firmer my limbs , and strung by toil ,
And round her temples bind the myrtle wreath .
Thou wilt not for regret or tears find time .
Silence and expectation held us all ;
In missing the hour when great jove wakes .
But i feel that he looks down to me
The merchant , luck in trade obtain ;
The moon had suddenly walked out of her shroud
To catch the first dear wonder of his face !
They rode , they swallow 'd up the plain ;
Each wish contracting , fits him to the soil .
And held the mind in perfect mood ,
No strength within me lies ,
The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb .
And the wind as it hurried by .
The colour ran true but the plant is small .
While chains gall saxons , saxon war survives .
You for whose fate such fate forever hovers ?
With song serene the wilderness he fills ,
Was changed to bright chords uttering melody 's spell .
Thou hast upon my sorrow poured thy balm !
Thy very cradle shall pour forth for thee
Be rightly read by subtle questioners ,
The oak-trees shouted as it passed ,
Its surges running high ,
Then was called a council straight .
Led to the sultry rock his murmuring bands .
And joined the choral song ,
Which your poor wills would mortgage before gained .
While chief baron ear sat to balance the laws ,
Too swollen to hold its lightning from the trees .
The youth to the streamlet 's brink drew near
No coward thought could bind me ,
And , dripping in the sunshine , sings again .
Dreaming beside its brother king , arose .
Straightway summoned all his courage ,
Till i had got preferment .
A foolish strife ; they see
And the long purple berries that rained on the ground
Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
Feebly , plaintively it sings ,
In such a mansion , as scarce thought finds words
Of priestcraft offered to it . spells obscene ,
Based on notes made while witnessing the fighting .
By thy bright beauty was it newly bred .
Courting is turned to a common vse ,
The echo of his deeds is ringing yet --
That life can show to me ;
The scorching flames climb round on every side ;
That rises from the abyss of my life .
For i have counted every tedious minute
And edge their spirits for immediate fight .
We freely place thy love upon
The boat forever leaves the land ,
Then gorey devils fought with lust
The dauber followed where he led : below
Steals no comfort , no grief doth borrow ;
They make laments upon the wondrous trees .
And howlets scream the music
Questions whose folly thy quick glance can see ?
How their nostrils run over
Of abstinence you have got a type --
He with the livery stood in some repute ,
Our hearts ' content thy heart shall also keep ,
I sought a deeper , drearier wave .
Of her great love for me has brought
From hand to hand the soft infection stole ,
That shall be made hereof .
Like sunshine went and came , and bade
Thrice a deep breath the knight relieved did draw ,
To hold to the railing of the new life
By ravished ganymede -- these wrongs remained .
Since earth on axle ran , --
Of the seven planets its due station gave ;
To her proud soul no common fear can bring :
Then fearing rust or soilure fashioned for it
Than that this pamphlet thy contentment find ;
Of finitude that fix the here and now .
For if no song i e'er had wrought ,
No answer gave the vánar king
In my roots a worm has nestled . "
The joie that the cite made ;
Stupids find the nowhere-road
In mutiny and discord find its end !
And now the rites discharged , our course we keep
And the costly gowns that fold thee ,
And wander their way to the devil !
My subtle machinations , they assumed
And a yankee counted with fretful care ,
When evening comes , with accents sweet
But a leaf that lingered brown ,
A little playmate whom the king held dear ,
Chased away the ugly spiders ,
Though the world thereby had sustained great loss .
' twould serve no purpose to recite
Bearing close envie to these riches rare ,
Can keep the nation free from harm . ”
His outset , of his journey spreads the fame :
Than of its middle made the light a centre ,
Of light the moon brought , white as frost .
't was father time who had come to share
Their glance might cast out pain and sin ,
To level with the dust a noble horde ,
The moving words telemachus attends ,
That made the breeze to blow !
I made of each fashion a note ;
He dreamed that he set two geese to dance ,
In smiles or tears finds present vent ,
Past the eighth court ; there met his sight ,
Their strength in all attempts to hold the foe .
And meet indifference with a joyful rage ;
Where future leads , and wander on the brine .
What monarchs have menaced and tyranny meant .
Cry which is breaking , which is bowed .
Has held thy blossoms in a close embrace .
And the old adam in me rises up ,
The stain on him remains .
He , stooping low , loosen 'd the earth around
Treacherous with him experienced equal doom .
Renew the fray , and stretched across the sea
My heart had found contentment in that year .
To piercing screes of purple gloom ,
Which to their corses came again ,
The river roared ; the winds to the young flowers
Let us pass the night together .
To whom the sad signal we gave ;
Then like the lark that passed the night
None great , though earth it fill ;
On baby 's face the roguish dimples lie ;
Which never yet saw navigate its waters
She made her face a darkness from the king :
And revel and song , made merry over death ,
Elected umpire , here comes to-day ,
I hold me firm in patience , knowing
For slow and slow that ship will go ,
That flowed here , to cleanse the soul amiss
Such care a meed in heaven will bring
And fruit that comes not of the vine .
Not dying saints enjoy such ecstacies
Which we do add ourselves , feigning to see
You and i have found our lips can meet .
There came a voice , that needle to the star
When spent with toils in serving human kind ,
Charged by achilles ’ great command i fly ,
Dandelion through the meadow makes
“ thus his enquiries answering ; -- whom thou art
And the brook seemed thus to sing :
Through still blue heaven serenely swims ,
This man and bring him happiness , but with heart
Aye to be sway 'd beneath thy smile :
Abhor , a perpetuity should stand :
A happy wife , although she led
Proud independence sways the aspiring soul ,
And the vast front its awful hush regain 'd .
Well now to heave the ship afloat ,
And fantasy laughs and gives chase :
On a sheer peak of joy we meet ;
From two honest fellows who made me a visit ,
Of shining and generous dreams ;
The honor ’d landlord thus his rights maintains ,
They changed the faith of solomon ,
Dim lies the way to death before me ,
Where freedom shall her generous plans pursue .
" and take your bows with speed ;
The spring goes up again .
Lo , it says , thou hast found
A faithful stewardship of gifts to show ,
Thus tumbling in conceits , he stumbled home ,
Then came dark moments ; lady , then i drew
Another , drawing tresses from her distaff ,
But whence were those that drove the sail
On gems and gold that round him blazed ,
And the sharp blade sheared the evil throat .
My heart would find the years more lonely here
For the man 's love once gone never returns .
It sleeps in his southern grave .
In the wind that through the window came .
His lamentation he inly made .
His flaring beams , me , goddess , bring
The little innocent soul flitted away .
Sob on and sigh for passion spent .
To restore my broken heart
Nothing is our own : we hold our pleasures
Wherein the life is caught .
Directing your footsteps , wherever you stray .
In one kiss full ten i drew :
From the sea that doth it lash .
With the heroes hunts the noble marko :
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet .
Such thought as gushing from their fountain make
The falling trophies of your conquest fair ?
The sands of time grow dimmer as they run ,
And life 's swift stream flows straighter ,
When thy merry step draws near .
' and indignation make thine eyes o'erflow ,
Seized steed and garb , confusion filling him ;
He gave his armor to his noble friend
What a picture they make against the skyline !
Errors were made by our fathers of old .
A star rose flaming from night 's purple sea -
The glories of their blooms expand ,
Just to console sad glory for being glorious ;
And made the gaudy moth forget its pride ,
Answered in the words which follow :
She with her eyes the unhappy signs explored ,
And still the vast waters above thee shall roll ;
Shall rise that wall of distance ,
Recalling how he stood by frederic 's tomb ,
The delight that consumes the desire ,
As with a magic , laid them all again .
My full heart longed for violets .
And time be swallowed in eternity .
Or ever a year be gone .
That crossed the time ere hope was dead .
Awake ! arise ! cast off thy drowsy dreams !
A soul that spreads creeping upon the earth
To scenes connected with the present times .
As to furnish a meal of their cannibal diet
When summer has forgotten and gone !
Let them the number and the form assign ;
Things that are made to fade and fall away ,
And where her roses breathed above ,
She 's lost its fellow , so golden yellow ,
Could catch the pathos , flowing wild ,
Sealed by the sunset and the evening star .
Which , breathed , my bosom would not feel ?
And around me swings the gay
And genius , still the more it glows ,
His faith confirmed and his trust renewed
Returning light and life dispelled the gloom
Take wings of love , that mounts the most :
And then our eyes were turned to one that came
And all her magic to thy eyes is given ;
Half choked with rage , king robert fiercely said ,
That contemplation into matter brought ,
A shyer , warmer tint awoke ?
I shall not see a happy day ;
He hastened . eunice shuddered , ran -- a twist
And dazzling circles that are seen
But count the stern realities of life .
And give it entrance in a braver heart . "
Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause
To speed the wildest dreamers
He carried down of this miraculous joy ,
Until he took the butcher 's fees :
Which surrounded and hid the celestials in greece
And shame that skulks behind ;
Where atlas bears the starry-spangled sky .
Except the river that runs to the sea !
Written in tablets , which he bade him show ,
One that says amen to every factious prayer ,
Nature so formed them that they might go far ;
The torments it deserves to try ,
And take the wage of shame .
The memory of the past may die .
Over this lost lyre 's murmurous chords
Her tamed white leopard leaped in fear ,
She flies not , though her heart takes flight
When o'er the street the morning peal is flung
Recalling what remarkably had passed
But has helped to shape her stately mien ,
The fingers of the deep hours slowly drew
The bulls of elis in glad triumph led ,
The shifting shadows rise and fall ,
For a ' the flowers i see ,
Has passed the sea from coast to coast ,
If thou wilt feel no pity , none ,
I feel this place was made for her ;
And the creditors find very little to pay .
From heaven will lightning fall on the land ,
Innocent children , pious mothers , pined
Of fighting . on his haunches rose the steed ,
Lost in the long-ago .
Shows wisdom perfect . what is midnight-gloom
Have squared the year to human compass , eh ?
Words still unknown , and framing numbered chants
Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart .
And the peaches had stolen blushes
The chariot bore him backward on the plain .
Reached a wild forest dark and dread
Now mix their dying cries ;
Life has no pleasure left for me
O grave ! what treasures do thy confines hold
The joyous cries contending in her path ,
Praise to him who made the light ,
And waits , in snug concealment laid ,
Yet stay -- there riseth over afric plains
And ask for them blessings that come from above .
So here i lay me down to rest ,
Boded no good , whatever it express 'd ,
But all in vain , for other waves swept on
But other sights and other sounds engage ,
Eyes which have looked on every mortal crime ,
Who would patiently pose to be pitied
These blossoms go .
And bring her love to her . '
No difference sees from one style to another ; "
Upheld the right , and lifted womanhood
Till the mountain top was gained .
Yet justice sways the universe of god .
Such trust he placed in her fidelity .
The nameless joy that trembled into tears ,
To make your merry blood run slow !
Than that which edward unto basil led ,
On a peak that mounts world 's brink ,
Now to our eyes , made dim with years ,
Their blows show greater will than power to wound ;
Their arrows keen can never pierce his soul ,
Panting they stood ; and a judas sold
That we could spell the thrilling secret out .
That , not hide , her happiness .
They spoke of progress spiring round ,
Whose mouths the mighty one 's commands convey ,
Their courage weak no shield of proof could bear ,
A tongue to speak with answering heaven gave they .
And master , galileo . it is brought
" for all i know to make it otherwise ,
The reins of office , and administered
Because i see , because i fear
Born in sin , and nursed in folly .
Where with the nose the meeting brows confined .
And a new light broke on my shadowed heart .
For thine own good my counsel take ,
Planting the hope of human purity ,
And eloquence from every gesture flows .
Could rouse the languor of the lingering boy .
Drawing sweet poison from the lovely sight ,
Is but to lay proportion 'd loads on each .
Would you the bloom of youth should last ?
The thought of it made mother cry ,
Shall fold in death her feeble wings
A beauty reared on nature 's rules ;
Then quietly the answer came ,
When evening is come ,
Swift to him the tidings of their coming flew .
Thus suddenly the battle changed its face :
Against ulysses have thy vows been made ,
What though my healthful days are fled ,
And the high sun shook gold upon her ,
That told the joy and pain of love ,
And found where idle sorrow lay
Throughout the poem to be found
To let high mirth prevail ,
And scarce recovering words his plaint renew 'd .
The lords and captains then came two and two ,
" and aye with that luxurious fire you fed
First smoothed their links of harmony ,
In this 't is god directs .
Remotely , plays on the misdeeming sense ,
Woe for the respite given by the gods
And borne on the breeze came their soft confession
Among the concourse passed the tyrian queen ;
The gods dislike to show to us frail mortals
Thou place thy trust ; let not the entrance broad
And sorrow the kiss that assuages ,
Aurora 's crystal wheels flash up the sky ;
To bound the aims of sinful man .
No dread of day which holds a weeping rain ,
That first came forward openly to stand
To count the beauty worth my wish or gaze ,
Before the ranks the rat-camp gained ,
He felt his blood run cold .
When sinking spirits find no cure
As god leads me will i go ,
The world should wake and be a soul .
They chide that noise which heedless youth affect ;
Which brings to mind her childhood 's innocent day
Happy happy time , when the white star hovers
The vision passed as glides a star ;
Faded away and soon it fled .
Impartial moon , that showed me all .
None but god the void can fill .
With its rewards and blessings strew my path
Sinks when his daily course is run .
Or north-west winds with cutting fury blow ,
A feast they made for him amidst the tents ,
By echoing fiends is borne , --
Comes the best .
And man hath got his fancy hence ,
But thy heart hath found release ,
As when some grey november morn the files ,
With darkness gave them peace . the very earth
Winter came , it still was may !
Tobacco , brought from countries harbouring
His simple pagan faith knows night and noon ,
For all things the delighted eye now sees
Which their sick sorrows shall assuage and banish .
Save in the breeze that came not ; savagely
In courts and palaces he also reigns
Had earth yet one whose smile could stir ,
After his craft-wit got aglow ,
The marble still his memory keeps :
" to put me into fear ?
His early vows were paid ,
Bring plenty and joy and rest ;
When drowsy sleep had fled , cornelia sought
Were my heart but here displayed ,
Of passion , that runneth ever
What words can tell , what words can praise
So spreading their sails in a sandy cave ,
And reached her shoulders , conquering their snows .
With sinless glories crowned ;
And thus , with gracious smile , enquiry made :
Like worlds to death and ruin driven ;
" that in heroic acts they may go on
Wild tumult in the state would rise .
Are green and waving hymns which whisper truth !
As he gazed on the form and noted the love
Making more black the hideous guilt to come !
That had led her to passion 's despair .
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway ,
The happiness he could not find .
This opens the bright mansions of the blessed ;
And here those bramble-flowers , that breathe
And vines that flourish in eternal green ,
For a merrier din shall resound within ,
Turning earth 's night to day ,
Love is doomed unless it grow .
" freedom rewards you -- naught can ella give ,
That reared us . at a thoughtless age allured
To dare our british foes to open fight :
The pilgrim , musing , took his way :
From shivering mist ascends the morning ,
That gave their gifts , and went their way ;
The following changes were made to the original text :
Their hopes and fears in council scanned :
And bade his willows learn the moving song .
Nor here may graver topics rise . --
Where the sea-waves softly play ;
Could not gain a higher wisdom ,
As rank indeed stood high or low ,
A whistling reached them from the hall house side ;
" what road shall we take from home ? "
There runs a glorious tide of life .
That the dull dust hides away ,
The more they open every heart .
But still no game was forced to halt
The bedside he stroked with so gentle an air :
Horns push and strive against opposing horns ,
And , if occasion serves , can whine ;
Where first our marriage-vows were given ,
Now spring comes round again
What merit or what grace to me reveals thee ?
Where his dreaming godheads lie ;
And earth , that lay so cold and darkling ,
And he fell in love with sally brown ,
And did at once dispel the gloom
The dull hard stone within him melt .
What gives this beauty to the grave ? the shroud
O spirit that man 's life left pure ,
Or comes in laughter from the sea 's sad lips
And find thine eyes upon me where i stand ,
Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne --
A fond pair , such as poets have drawn ,
Faintly the eastern blue , and fades from sight ;
And filled with hope was every prisoner 's breast ;
His spirits he recalls , his eyelids raises ,
And breathes destruction on the trojan bands .
His length of belly pied with mighty spots -
Thro ' all the rounds of folly ranging ,
Would ever shed a tear .
Whose splendor now all the meadow fills !
They were breaking the snow on high ,
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield .
O’erwhelmed in sorrow ’s rushing deep ,
Can set the torch of love a-blazing .
With panic as they pressed on ceaselessly .
They lie beyond mischance .
The feast was now begun ; these eating sat
Time out of mind erected on the frontiers
The seeds of sin bring crops of woe ;
And night triumphant o’er the landscape reigned .
That bring the fog and mist .
And the kisses plucked and thrown
Gleams and glamors all are fled ,
So thy sad stars dispens 'd to thee
In burning words breathed forth the marvel told ;
Were in some part neglected and made void . "
In london , showing what befell him there ,
In civil conflict met on bosworth-field ;
There a fence is reared of iron ,
Kindled to guide her winged paramour .
Without one glimmering presage of the truth , --
In clouds of smoke raised by the noble fray ,
As it swept on toward the sunrise ;
Back to warm life its sleeper gave ,
Set in a sightless grin ,
Till thus amphinomus the silence broke :
Without a rider to direct the rein .
Her crystal mirror holds , unite their streams .
And take some deed accomplished for my pay .
To reckon they 'd come to grief ,
While softest slumbers seem to seal his eyes ;
And goodness combined makes a pleasure of duty .
Where the river turned to the broad sea ,
My heart stood still for a moment ,
Half hearkening what the buried season says
With a fresh crimson bride flashed by ,
And happy lovers blend sweet shadows there
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day
And the pope held solemn service
What wealth the show to me had brought ;
Mark for their shafts . around the rivals drew ,
A reefer takes the dauber for a flame ,
Knew the blessings man had found ,
My love her life doth prove ;
It is that thou hast made my life too sweet
Horrors immeasurable , clutching at dreams
That showed me in a gracious court of trees
I shall be cleansed from all my sins ,
Of man , and turns to search its solitude .
At the drowsy dusk when the shadows creep
When nature lets the wild earth go its way
What power shaped the wicked night ?
The south wind rose at dusk ,
That slumber hath made mute .
As the heart waited for wherein i wrote them .
But i next sunk trap and sealed his fate ,
Then our tribes made a ceremonial of glad rejoicing
That on the summit of dominion stood ,
Told how it fared with his sweet mistress there .
To show the goodness of the almighty sire ?
And give the present hour to genial joy . "
The fate which sternly threatens there
For he opens the whole discussion by stating ,
Aside his very mirror soon was put ;
Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . '
Implored that present pardon might be shown
His beaded eyes wept tears of shame ,
When a shepherd filled with malice ,
Nor strive our fortunes to relieve ?
With brightest hope and faith , and filled
But self-destruction therefore sought , refutes
Leapt , lighting dark clouds charged with thunder .
The shaded grass , he bends insatiate eyes
We know not ; love is hard to seize .
Your brunstane devilship i see ,
Above , how high progressive life may go !
When thoughts were strung too thick to speak ,
Where answer to the innocent is made .
What time removes was but a loan ,
Power fitted to the season ; wisdom-bred
As the saint miss the glories i relate ;
And wrapped my soul in darkest tones of night !
As the sad wave swept him on .
In the jolly life we lead ? --
To scatter terror ' mid the souls of men .
Of hating him is all desire cut off .
That smiles upon his sleep ! the sinner veils
And break our hearts wi ' sorrow ;
The stars their music sing forevermore .
And bear him silent floating to the sea .
As it feebly put in its frail little note .
Thus deeply stung , she made a fierce reply .
The country will e'er gain the day ;
Who since the morning-hour set out from heaven
Its pathway , which the wisest fail to spell ;
And carry ruin where they bend their course ,
Though brought from fortune 's mirkest gloom .
I feel that my conception soars beyond
Never fall to bitter weeping ,
Can grasp the thought of deity .
And eastward held their hasty way ,
Were fighting for the crown .
Comes faintly like the breath of sleep .
Smaller , the thyme trees seemed to go
Since what i write to-day shall stand
Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain ,
So fair a bloom from vanquished winter won .
Sudden blasts of triumph swelling ,
What matters to them if advantage they gain ,
Which doth give losers leave to speak .
With lips high thoughts have weighted ,
Everywhere they see destruction ;
To dim the sunshine of my faith
Touching their lover 's faith and creed ,
Between two mountains sank the sun --
A gust of wind sterte up behind
And dreams restore the dews of paradise ;
Sigh for the shepherds , sunk to rest !
And o'er his wine he gave a toast ,
Can see they do n't come honest by .
Wherein all things go on , the fire of love
My pleasure yielded to my pain ,
" a voice went forth from heaven
That sits a little while at sorrow 's feet
In hopeless conflict lost his king appears ;
What doth my spirit to thy will constrain ;
And greece around sat thrill ’d with sacred awe .
Nor gave the polish to their genuine gold .
As they trace the river 's windings ,
Too late , the truth upon him breaks ! --
Spring and daisies came apace ;
Still fate , as then , asks prayer .
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;
And it gives me hope to be reconciled :
Which may be found of use hereafter .
The breathless hours like phantoms stole away .
Filled with rage , began his singing ;
Bearing a message full of trust and love ,
Adown them ever water ran ,
His chest , enclosure of the guarded heart .
He who to shepherds grace hath ever shown ,
And my wife and babes you chase ,
Is like the rune from nature caught ?
That made the day so bright and earth so fair
And cast our hopes away ;
Roses blushing as they blow ,
Do quiet lips , where lonely anguish cries ,
Could tread them out to darkness utterly ,
Dark shadows gathered round ;
Out of this river issued living sparks ,
His towering projects hold ; all fancy 'd gold .
When fools cast taunts at your gate ,
The wound such virtue from the juice derives ,
Was joy , in following joy , as keen
That clasped the ribbands of that azure sea ,
What came of all life 's bitterness ,
Fletcher gives her the true parentage : --
How cold the quarter that the wind best loves ,
As though his foot had roused a snake ,
And it can dwell on moonlight glimmer ,
Demons rush in , and chaos comes again .
Perchance some day thou ' lt breathe of love
First came the dance of the little stumbling children ;
Still loosening to the breeze , the skipper stood ,
Blithe airs that blow from down and sea ;
There the level shores extended ,
Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
Still may the favouring muse be found :
The iron clanging sank through the light air ,
Knowing that silence brings no good to kings ,
Indeed , they 've power to wound , beyond
Of the clouds about him rolled
And now we reach 'd the orchard plot ,
Take up , take up your burden of woe ,
And when louder the loud awe is roaring ,
As spring approached , were spread through each command .
Would mirth run round , with generous fare ;
Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick
Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet
Heaven soon sets right all other matters ! --
When march winds brought vague rumors of the spring ,
Then poured the anguish of her breaking heart
To whom that fortune gives so fair a grace .
Moon in his soul that dimmed the moon above .
Which held the sacred dust that friendship gave .
This i recall now even while i mourn ;
In strength of limb he had not met ,
Proof that earth was made for man .
When spring brings back blue days and fair .
Now to downy grasses clung ,
Whilst they yet stood their victory to boast .
That sweeps with all its autumn bowers ,
And though he leave me cold and mute ,
A short absence will soon cure her disdain .
The wintry west extends his blast ,
The favouring wind swung free .
As the grim heart pants crushing in the grasp .
Beneath her brows the lids fall slow ,
And their oaths are kept at leisure .
Quick as the mind ; and will shall find release
Perhaps will catch the gleam of sacred fire
And men , to get their circumstances oiled --
Or grief for comfort that it gives ,
Whose doom would tear thee from my heart ,
Their radiant labyrinths to weave around
Reaching up to find the light
And grateful offerings on your altars laid . "
The flame ! the envious flame , it leapt
A friend to all who come within its posts --
Frosty winter chased away
My days have crackled and gone up in smoke ,
With great enjoyment rested there .
Admittance found the portal masked ;
That lay in the house that jack built .
The hellish thing comes , on the morning after .
A proper chapter found as soon as sought ;
Its beauty never waxeth old ;
To him thy presents show , thy words repeat :
't is but to follow thee ;
The castle alone in the landscape lay
Thy dear honored parents drank deep of thy love ,
Than history ever gave or genius wore !
The sinking vessel in her eddy draws ,
The priests who call upon thy name are slain ,
But grateful take the good i find ,
They pour forth vows , their embassy to bless ,
Pray him from us that thought aside to lay ,
Is yet more kingly . this attracts the soul ,
From her cold silence with a bound she broke ,
The nervous , shuddering thrill , which came
But lips where smiles went out and in ;
He sheds an acid tear or two ,
As soft notes soar
The past comes up with overflowing tears ,
Dearer than life , thy feet are set
And the wretch felt assured that once plunged in ,
The pledges of the past renew
The dauntless heart that feared no human pride ;
Enjoys the air it breathes .
That listening ear to gain .
From neck unknown . one way of life remained ,
The limbs to mar , the soul to lose ?
The song went with them in their flight ;
For freemen will render full justice to scott ,
Of gold and silver richly spread .
I see , i hear , them all !
But tears and broken words his mingled thoughts betray .
But in vain my tears i strew .
His well-framed enterprises have gone awry .
That asks no more than what it freely gives ,
Wicked witch that sent these troubles ,
They challenge truth . an empire makes reply .
And countless millions meet their god !
No shelter given to any work of darkness .
' that while from circling year to year ,
The soul in all things born or framed ,
Ludicrous , yet too monstrous to be borne ,
To him nor vanity nor joy could bring .
From the impious worship that seduced the world .
Michael from adam ’s eyes the film removed . "
To bring a spirit from the circle of judas ;
And the gates of brass are broken .
And gentian paints the sphere to suit her mind
Fragrant white indian matting allowed you to pass .
He wrote this polar melody , and set it ,
But ere she died she made a full confession
I gave them my last dreams ,
If saddest sighs swell sweetest sound , --
Ring out the grief that saps the mind ,
He ceased : and brahmá made reply ;
Sense on the present only feeds ; the soul
And the widow 's prayer goes up for him ;
Hair that strayed elfinly ,
To music -- music , that can speak
Of fair love lost for ever and a day .
Peace fills the mighty minster ,
With the ingrowing thirst that burns .
To trail its venom o'er the sweetest flowers ;
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood ;
Through the white sleet-clouds as they pass ,
That found the common daylight sweet ,
Till all my widow 'd race be run -- "
" next would i court my liberty ,
His weary tears that touch him in the rain .
Who , shrinking not from sin and shame ,
Toward the goddes finde grace
And life 's swift stream flows straighter ,
Is breaking on their sombre sky :
There is found no time to sleep ,
For longer sorrow that had never come ,
So all things lend to thee
Following , following after thee .
But they ran trickling down her cheeks apace
Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew ,
They find no respite and reach no rest ,
The holy city , lifted high her towers ,
What fits not into the human brain :
Then , issuing forth , it gurgled through a hole
There breaks a sound of joyous bells
Or like a system coupled with a doubt ;
When the hoarse roar proclaims the lion near .
My heart was filled with idle dreams
While down the river we float on forever ,
But here comes a heart that is bleeding
Was lost of wrecking the spaniards ere they joined
Which is our gold crushed out of joy and pain
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish ,
Honour 's thirst , that blood will slake ;
Unless perchance some angry greek may seize
A faint voice fell from the stars above --
Stream and streamlet seek the hollow .
Like flowers that heard the tale of dews ,
Mary that made god mirth ,
A sword of wrath swung ominous ,
Strew your gladness on earth 's bed ,
But make the absolute best of what god made .
We bore , as freedom 's hope forlorn ,
My soul , with christ join thou in fight ;
And gold and purple gave a welcome bright .
That , ere that summer 's bloom was shed ,
The bark was softened , and renewed the green .
There fell a battle far in the north ;
Jove bids at length the expected gales arise ;
Truth will but stand the stronger
When mary stay 'd beneath . but not to deal
Although one summer evening 's dew could fill
They bounded by the happy queen of may .
Of green and stirring branches is alive
It lifts its heavy bracts of flattened bloom
Untouch 'd by years or grief , i see
In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray ,
A distant age asks where the fabric stood ;
Blossoms from loving hands tenderly cast .
And crush my heart and darken his name .
When the summer spreads the flowers ,
And all that mighty heart is lying still !
Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown ,
Along the thin white trail that wound and climbed
Bidding the heavens and earth make way
The moorish squadrons they rejoicing sprung .
A laugh rings out upon the air
And memory of the modest lips that sang it .
A sympathizing sorrow stopped his breath .
Soon sol will sink into the west
At times with honest toil reposed -- at times
Where all take life and doth the world renew ;
With tears his eyelids pressing ,
Whilst hearing them speak , or in making replies ,
Click went the spring ; down fell the door !
Now he melted them to pity .
And boldly sinks into the sounding strings .
Who railed at him ? he did forgive the hands
Thus went donna clara dreaming ,
To make her beauty vary day by day ,
The fumes that from the sable pitch arose ,
And set to work millions of spinning worms ,
And merlin took his leave and passed
Some fairy is winding his sweet elfin horn .
The whistling winds had ceased to blow ;
So saying , to his assembly back he drew :
Her honour there , secure from stain ,
Breaking the silence of the seas
To raise such fabrics in the air --
And that immortal laughter shook the world .
Here are the lords whose starry banner shines
" the wind , the wind is coming south
He heard and followed and obeyed ; his faith
We then should feel , my own true love !
And my region grow more fruitful . "
On his wounds will pour soft balm .
To slumber lays him .
To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind .
And halmar laid three others low ,
Wild blossoms and the winds that steal their sweets ,
Where none but elders laid their head ;
Posterity stands cursed : fair patrimony
That for achilles ' image stood his spear ,
The dying savage feels the weapon drove .
Declares that " exhaustion arises from rapture , "
As worth all praise i hold ;
Kissing the crannies that are split with heat ,
They thought the tide of grief would flow
Springs out , and gives a loose to glee .
And nothing but time as a quarry to chase ,
This mystery that before him lay
That up from the ruins came .
Formed , as they tell in times of old
Than vengeance takes in creed-taught minds ,
Some reverence for the laws ourselves have made ,
Of level sun finds sister marta 's face ,
It holds some fairer woman for your bride ;
In fields where hate has hurled
In chaste desires , on heavenly beauty bound .
Whence speedy succours to the haven came .
But , to make very keen their appetite ,
The melting night recalls me with her tears .
Soft as the dews that fell that night ,
She took the occasion to sing me this song :
For meat , shall give thee melody .
The orthodox said that it came from the air ,
Whose humble life lies not in fortune 's way .
To take his joyous flight .
Grew tender , and began to shed a tear ;
Nor vent on senseless earth thy vengeance vain ,
In silent glory swept the fields of heaven !
Disclosed its wonders when his footsteps strayed ;
When the impregnate air retains the thread ,
See hopes and friendships dead about him lie --
Which round about the fat intestines lay ,
Mid emperors or kings that filled a throne ,
Eternal life they 'll lose .
Angel-fair , walhalla 's charms displaying ,
Now do n't you see the contrast ? i refrain
Each looking round to seek escape from death .
When the dusk comes down and the shadows play ,
Expectance draws the curtain from their fate .
Which made me whilom cease to fret ;
See the long-drawn column go ;
To walk the ways which others tread ,
Back to your place , lest my servants see ,
And found the sea beneath you like a glass ;
No man can change the common lot to rare .
And makes my heart beat quick .
My priestly guide , the plan allow . ”
The snow drifts by in fat white flakes ,
The waters wild went o'er his child ,
Lie with companions fit ;
Rodomont fain would close upon his foe ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
The grief my heart was striving to forget .
Beneath the winding lightning , darkness came to birth ,
Want that strange smile that gave me token
Years have sped by with rapid wing
" cupid , " venus went a-calling ,
So that 's how jenny spends her lonely hours ,
And wrung a new note from my wounded side .
Who is it speaks of defeat ? --
To face dark slavery 's encroaching blight !
And cooling airs sprang up to blow
Of fragrant shores fast rising in his course .
The faded vines refuse their hills to shade ,
About the piece , he kept with soldiers bold :
( as all the early records show ) --
And drain his soul of faith and strength
Priestcraft in lieu of priesthood sits enthroned .
Their very shadows make us yield ;
" and nature , the old nurse , took
In liberty to choose , in power to reach ,
Paths of their own they clear to future bliss ,
Around our naked speech and makes it bold .
Think ye , can words alone preserve them ?
And the truth come tell to me , o. "
His eyes with reverence meet , and praised
Emblem of general maternity lifted above all ,
Then saturn 's son to iris gave command :
And got his heart 's desire . "
But safe behind their sheltering earthworks stay ,
Who now with time thy days resolve ,
Again the weather threaten 'd , -- again blew
Here fame resides ; and in the loftiest towers
Love and respect together must combine
In a palace of snow he holds his court ,
Life 's rougher paths grew level where he trod .
Cheerly goes the blood to keep the beat :
No trumpet call shall break his sleep again :
And the three , taking that for my reply ,
Where summer sunset streamed upon our shapes ,
Behold thy face , and doubts remove ;
To suck the flowers , and drink the spring .
We will pass the night together . "
He spoke to soothe his wild alarm :
Or force my weariness
Its music , lest it should not find
Yours is the genial influence that smiles upon
When griping grief the heart doth wound ,
All things went wrong with me .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Eyes that seemed to ask a question ,
To heal her soul of sin .
If on his brow the crescent moon he bear ,
Flaming , flickering on the night
I stood ; my eyes were fixed upon that face
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
Borne on the breezes blowing from the west ,
When thy heart with grief was swelling ,
Not forced to frame excuses for his birth ,
Where the great winds go up
It made me issue forth from my own mind .
Light blossoms , dropping on the grass like snow .
Faint lights fell this way , that way floated ,
With blinking eyes , that meant no treachery .
The clay that held it .
That gave us th ' electoral stem ?
The warm quick tears do run :
Thy calm , sweet influence do thou me lend ;
And through the sallow skin disclosed the bone .
The guests are met , the feast is set :
Where vindhya ’s tangled forests spread .
Or aught wealth may bestow ;
The shady wood that crowned him shook ,
And gave us freedom for our heritage ;
The redbreast pours his sweetest strains ,
And such good courage to my heart there coursed ,
Who so wildly spends his days ,
There is not one can bitter tears restrain ,
That in trim gardens takes his pleasure : --
To the sweepers as they swept them .
The throne of the tyrant shall rock and quake ,
Whitbread hath got a marvelous great name ;
And yet his chin no sign of manhood bore ;
The singing soul that moves thee , and that moved
But soon his grave eyes rested on her face ,
And o'er the abyss the dizzy pathway hangs ;
The increate perpetual thirst , that draws
A long day stretches to the very end .
Following thy lead , illustrious atchison ,
Of a radiant hall their orients they unpack .
That you may see how lightly life can run .
The crow makes wing to the rooky wood ,
And give to fame what we to nature owe ;
She hides her woe , and helps him go ,
For sinners vile ; that they might not be driven
And freely adore all his spirit hath made ,
My girl-heart turned and clung to you !
Dull november brings the blast ;
Till each fantastic hope expire in woe ,
Rich joy and love he got and gave ;
Go wrong , a fellow should begin
Whose influence , felt everywhere ,
Its soul , finding again youth 's mysteries .
Would not alone have made him insecure ,
He all the country could outrun ,
They made to be the cause of holy thoughts ;
Yet on my heart thy name is laid ,
Sweet science , this large riddle read me plain :
The rest complains of cares to come .
That went through thine heart ,
Whose sweet image so dear silently beckons afar .
Yet something shadowed him . i recall his words --
Will love 's chalice wash away .
The toils and pains that knowledge bought --
And beat them to barricades --
That night saw old wrongs forgiven ,
And green had grown the withered gourd .
Attracts them , follow ) , might ascend thus far
Answered in the words which follow :
With pain whose surge i felt to anguish grow ;
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell ,
As sympathy and love could make
With each some sorrow dies ,
With gardens poised in air
Stood where dead men burst the earth-clods
What time fair virtue , struggling with despair ,
So beautiful , came foul and-twenty elders ,
Thy shimmering silks thy path reveal .
To new appearance . meeting these , there came ,
The sun laughs in the lake .
And far more weighty than conjecture brings ;
She stood a ' last night at this door ,
Should holy thoughts come o'er thee
With news of victory come ,
All the fragrance of summer when summer was gone .
Where the fountains sprinkle their lemonade
Can fill the void within his craving breast .
That which my speech no farther can declare .
The whom fortune hath set alofte
The sight of his shoulders makes me sore ! "
Earth 's kingdoms fade to a remembered dream ,
Just a touch to try and off it came ;
The steed devoted to the host
Which well might pass for natural flowers which blow ,
His meal comes mighty cheap . "
On me their vengeance turns : they look at me
The grief that clouds thy lovely brow ,
In that cool valley where the colors lived .
Leads her married , as step-daughter ,
Blindly drawn , came darting through the wave ,
He reached forth his friendly conquering hand ,
To see the human soul take wing
The protean shapes of evil . we have struck
Who stands to battle every wrong ,
And fill 'd with terror all the trojan host .
Our way we held , more rugged than before ,
Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound :
For mine was joy that knew no ending ;
Spirits , who came loud wailing , hurried on
An equal fate on either side appears :
Though little , make it large in love ;
" love for the virtue which attended me
Who quite forgot the while that moments fly ;
The surging mob , the monks ' procession holy ,
Drawing sweet poison from the lovely sight ,
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears .
And watch the seas glide by .
Softening such charms as it displays
The light in the dust lies dead --
Perpetuates your blood for sinners shed .
And the star spangled banner in triumph shall wave
She seems to give gladness while limping along ,
The flowing waves of love sublime ,
That bears for all fair fruits
So the winter now closed round them
These their joyous welcome bring --
Exalted , and her hands reached up to heaven .
Nor at the altar take thy place !
Who found some rapture in the wind 's caress .
No strength detains the unsubstantial prize ,
Filled fu ' wi ' clavers about sin
' now sweeping floods rush down the slope ,
For arid grief had burnt up tears ,
Is void ) , the same hath made my cemetery
This brings on autumn , which recruits
The yelling shrieks of thousands strike the shore :
His brightest hour still shone forth from a cloud ,
" twelve months are gone and over ,
And winter fell and cold december came ,
" the power that made , the breath that blew
Beneath his altar may glide in !
From the pent walls our customs round us shape ;
They span the waves , they belt the plains ,
While from the west comes murmuring earthly noise ,
The mystery that will now be represented .
In a whirlwind play yank takes the pot .
Things which in hungry mortals ' eyes find favour ,
My stomach having come to me ,
Quick he takes his balm of healing ,
It never knew the tide of cankering fears
The wind sighs softly through the falling leaves ,
When happier hands shall crush rebellious power ,
And set then to the passion that enthralls
Earth repossesses part of what she gave ,
To gain the land we bore the weighty blast ;
There came to his grave-side ,
Which by and by black night doth take away ,
And underneath her glories build a tomb ?
Or the waves had brought thee hither ,
And the time of your tryst shall pass away .
His tender bloom to manly growth sustain 'd :
She could feel cold eyes of spirits
And all day long , where altars stand ,
Winter spreads it with folds of snow .
I bade him , plied with varied lore ,
Make content and ease thy aim ,
Could feel him smile .
In thoughts , that make thee grieve .
And in adam 's heart he laid it ,
In the most truthful least the will they follow .
Where oleanders scatter their ambrosial fire ?
These are the days when skies put on
Of anguish swept his features o'er ;
" what though bland flattery all her arts apply ?
But i am now in bands of sorrow held ,
Be minded how from italy she caught ,
The trees splash the sky with their fingers ,
Wild and sad are the thoughts you bring .
He mourned occasion slipping by ,
" no word says the sea , o pines ,
Thy late reviving roman soul desponds
Singers of morning and waters that run .
The fifth and last act still remains for me .
And the spring again came dancing ,
Light may come where all looks darkest ,
The mild italian winter was half spent ,
Which led swiftly to gaol , with consumption therein .
Nought that was good to him came amiss ,
Thus rendering ignorance worse than wickedness ,
The debt that sweeps the fragment from the board ,
This " rushing " influenza ,
And buy such comforts as their means afford .
He tossed it with a laugh . i wore
All betray the march of knowledge ;
It shows a soft and amber bloom .
And song for many a season made ,
With eyes that charm and lips that sing ,
But never do they make me proud
And linking every spirit to its god .
I feel this mournful dream impart
To my soul her soul replies .
Forbid to taste , the fruit of knowledge hung ;
His daughter , and his hands charged with the wreath
They led him forth his doom to hear ;
Tell who gavest thee thine evil !
But send thy peace on hearts that pray ,
Upon the borough moor that lay .
Then thou approving might ' st my song attend ,
The magic car moved on .
And o'er the dying 's ear has gone
And with the boon gives talents for its use .
't is not enough no harshness gives offence ,
Filled with unconscious life were less than naught ,
And now love goes rejoicing .
Where chili spreads her green lap to the sea ,
O let my heart no further roam ,
Before his eyes returned the magic dame ;
Storms only , brought my youthful morning red ,
Flowers fade , and perfume passes ; nothing pleases
Of feeling where true genius lies ;
Laughter flown or lost delight ,
And our eyes wear a summer 's bright glory ,
Let not our heart be troubled at the clang
The use of deeds is to show love ;
Full surely again shall summer come .
Where the brook ran away .
Haply her woman heart divined the spell
Until a breeze should fill her sail anew :
The avengers closed upon their foe ,
The road winds out its weary way ,
And khara from the conflict turned ,
My draught , leaving for curious quizzings yet
Is hot to show whatever it has found
That time has made romantic :
I gave aunt ruth no peace , until she planned
Only spoke the words which follow :
Straight to my anxious thoughts the sound convey 'd
When reckless hands her heart-wounds roughly tear ,
Sweet soul ! a kiss to follow
Blind with the tears that filled her swimming eye ,
With other wars my song shall burn ,
Of door and headboard . where it wants to get
The year is going , let him go ;
To the soldier 's heart would come .
The trees stand strangely still .
And made the waves his hollow shell resound ,
And her cheek wore a smile of joy
That awful yawn which sleep can not abate .
And let thy clarions ring among the spheres ;
Full many a year has passed since then ,
An old fur cloak to keep me warm .
Too long the world has smiled to hear
The mystery of joy made manifest
And when the year its end had reached ,
And what the reason grasps not , faith believes .
And my immortal soul to him who made it .
For thee our rising youth to manhood grow ,
Their cues cut short , their occupation gone !
May yield a trustier friend than woman seems ,
A train of following flames ascending drew ;
That , happy frailties to all ranks applied ,
Who kissed his wings which brought him yesterday
Arts , sciences , no branch was made a mystery
It is a life well spent -- its close
Fill 'd with his happiness ,
Sitting one day upon her heavy thought ,
Feeling what england lost when reynolds died .
Ukko , gave the youth his broadsword ,
His faith is hard to bind .
The rose is dead , the summer fled ,
( thus issuing to the pilot his command ) ,
And dismal ruin seems to threaten it . "
By thine enduring life that flows
As clung its perfume sweet unto her master .
They almost seem to touch with spring the earth .
And the valley mists are curling up the hills .
Had left a lovely awe on that fair face ,
Tones that make the heart in my bosom flutter ,
And he sinks as sank the town ,
Has stood many winters the storm and the sleet --
All earth i brought beneath my sway ,
And brighten up a lonely life . "
The house stands , or it stood but yesterday .
Shall the shepherds of arcady follow
Up from the river as the twilight falls ,
But then you say christ came with final truth ,
To settle her annuity .
Is that which leads to home .
It drives them : hope of rest to solace them
In scourging and purging oneself of sin ?
He only gave a tearful gulp ,
' gainst everlasting doom , there rose again
But now they drive me to despair .
And cruel winter holds the land ,
Just the object to make you shudder .
And can close the wound that pains you .
For us the stream of fiction ceased to flow ,
The feast disturb ’d , with sorrow vulcan saw
The dark brown eyes meet mine no more ,
A doubtful step , and timid fingers knocked ,
Whom he hath made partakers of his nature ;
Thus on each part the sinners stood , but soon
Remaining , though the seasons pass 'd ,
Who hast with life imbued
The ancient faith to hold ;
Are opened by a mortal 's kindly deed .
He drew his audience upward to the sky . "
Quick he snatched the fire of heaven
And the fierce pain clutched me and held me ;
Let lippes and hearts lift high the noise
And bore its fragrant sweets alang :
When other healings all were asked in vain ?
And groans , that rage of racking famine spoke :
Soon the strains come nearer , clearer ,
Seems even to infect my spirit and consume ,
That fills with its horror the perfumed air .
Is led from virtues paths and truth :
That is each round shows more divinity ,
To me was pleasing ; all my mind was set
Lest he should come to harm .
Who in his time had made heroic bustle .
Which watchful legions keep and guard ,
Where the prairie lies sunny and brown ;
The offer which i now shall make :
That sears his heart -- but mocks its agony .
Can feel one glimpse of love 's divinity .
To place or gain finds out its way ,
To pass what time remained to him below :
Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth .
To bear them light on her celestial wings .
Than a ripple to rise and leave the sea .
To win unknown lands and their mysteries reveal .
Where is the mother that looked on my childhood ?
Were fortified with reason 's ring , would see
Beginning in the darkness , the mystery will conquer ,
Brings triumph to the younger queen .
Still doth the file of hebrew dames proceed .
He saw the spot where jacob 's ladder stood ,
As leads the galaxy from pole to pole ,
The danes closed round , a roaring ring ,
" and freedom comes with new-born ray
Which joyous should have made penelope ,
Singing still , to the light that shone
From labour could not wean them ,
With breath of balm blown everywhere ,
With feigned shows of tender love made soft ,
Who bears the mournful tidings of my death . "
I would not undervalue church connection ,
On good and evil both they fall ,
The last his sullen voice to raise ,
Stopped short of spring that day .
As though she sought to parry doom with words .
One little spot of ground in mercy lent ,
And pity were more sore than heart can bear ....
Quick with words that rush to find them .
Too quickly comes the evil day . "
He gives the emperor his right hand glove .
He made the soul from possible intellect ,
We make delay , that somewhat first the sense ,
Fury tossed from tree to tree ,
And saw the chill sea glimpses slowly wake ,
Summer comes and winter goes ,
No word could help , no light make clear .
Where summer 's falling roses stain
From good old gossips waiting to confess
And claim them while they flow .
While time lasts , for new hearts to come
By years we live we reckon not our life ;
The utmost of thy heaven comes only so
Will make life doubly hard to bear , and tempt
Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark .
The marvellous shiver through her body ran ,
But all of the things that belong to the day
To give maiden blushes
He leap 'd the present age ,
We 'll reach the moon ;
That bites and stings .
Till the stiff acre , broken into clods ,
Then to the ships the pylian spearmen bore
Setting them suddenly all alight .
That man was made to mourn .
And many herods lie in wait each hour
The dense blue smoke arose . nor heat nor cold
That unwinds itself in red tranquillity ;
The last new hero makes his bow :
And let thy misty vapours march so thick ,
How many lovers you make sigh ?
Only give them fire to light them .
While heaven and earth surrendered to the storm .
That changed us into soldiers ; swing your bells
With sweet smiles mingling ; he with pity moved
May be pounded into atoms ,
` their eyes upturned and begged and burned
I give your virtues , which so far extend ?
A plainly set , but well-cut solitaire ,
Though rising suns put glories on the heights .
In the divine athene melt away ;
One of our giant statutes ope its jaw .
From skirt to skirt a fiery region , stretched
Bearing the seed of death and woe at last .
True hearts compel the sap of sturdier growth ,
The words what ca n't be hid ,
And love lays bare the passion-breathing rose ;
See , on her face a glow is spread ,
Strove to make profit square with right ,
Wherefore the king much grief and pity felt ,
Like drops of honey came their words ,
The spirit spelled by the lotus swoons ,
There never was a better bargain driven ;
The guilt must share .
As down to the stream his way he took ,
With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan .
Risen from eastward , fallen to westward and forgotten ,
For as the evening falls , the fever rises ,
As through the gate of paradise we swept , --
I wish it never led to something worse .
The threads had gathered , for their forceful sway
Kapo took the cones selected ,
For we 're going on a long job now .
Peace means an emptiness , which rests to die .
Which must be lifted , though the reaper groan ;
Those lips that love 's own hand did make ,
Though sorrow long has worn my heart ;
Comes the moan of a creature ’s pain .
Straight hitherward came troop and star ;
As from the hero ’s wound it came ,
What elements have made thy sweetness ,
God sets the music in each soul ; no hand
First enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls
I drew ulysses from his wandering way
Deeming he should not find that king elsewhere ,
Here took we passage to the other shore .
Enjoys what music fills the plaintive song ;
The austere pantheon , into heaven shall soar
Is founded in the faculty which sees ,
Fade into a dream of grief ,
The fog falling drearily ;
And added four fair damsels , whom he chose
Shaking the tune from his wings
The cook laid poison for the guest ,
Glory to brighten the work that we find ;
Tell me what has made thee angry ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Quick to read in the wife 's sad eyes ,
A fearful storm to bring such things to pass .
The subtle spells around us cast ;
Soft pity to infuse :
That swell and sink beneath the listening stars ;
Which he kept for battle and days of need ;
Or pass the years in perfect bliss ;
Shines into my heart as it shone that night ,
Shall our new england stand erect no longer ,
Yet found no happiness in heart or home ,
Twilight follows the longest noon .
No rights which the people are bound to respect .
Its rapid splinter drew ; beamed twice and thrice
That grateful greece with streaming eyes might raise
And countersigns had given , dispatched to crave
The thrilling darts of harmony he feels ,
To follow ; and thrice above him all the heavens
Or , should a sigh of sorrow steal
Leaving no trace of tyranny , but just
Could soften hardest soul ; that he so still
And let nae the sea come in . '
The " peace that passes human understanding " ;
That lets his false dice freely run ,
When elections stirred the people ,
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought :
Whose sail went seaward yesterday from shore
Roaring from nether hell and filled with ice ,
The days had rolled into the past .
This hurtful hawk had made them poor .
Come lay his heart and inmost entrails bare ,
Soon shall shield the old from harm ,
Nothing can draw the heart of man but good ;
All colors hid of things in earth or sky ,
And rising to a second birth
Of little threads our life is spun ,
Happily now on classical soil i feel inspiration .
Thus a murmur through the crowd went .
A farmer built around his crop
And the whole earth joined in singing
And shaped the soul that breathed below
They spread their beauties to the sun ,
Though withered , thy tears will unfold it again .
The king upon his throne was set ;
Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground ,
And made it into smiles .
Nor parting tears are shed ava ' ,
Full of compassion , raised ; and from the train
There came a thundering from the topsail yards .
Her hands outstretched , to meet the great release .
“ my service this remuneration finds :
Shrinks from life 's task in wild dismay ;
At noontime when they meet the sun .
By subtlety she hoped to find some way
And find each other good ,
Ah , let them keep their faith sincere ,
By turns hot embers from her entrails fly ,
My love , my father ! how you stood
Their light where fell a curse .
All nature 's difference keeps all nature 's peace .
Like light dissolved in star-showers thrown :
From acute fever they send forth such reek . "
And his strong arms against the city turned ,
Around , around , flew each sweet sound ,
On those affects which easily yield to sight ;
Shot the wild terror of its glance afar --
From pasture follow to their drinking-place
His ancient race shall still uphold . ”
Your plan is fixed to hunt them down ,
She issued , and from th ' other gods apart
The waters against her crowded up .
Thus , through the present , sorrow goes ,
Which lies between romagna and the realm
And threw the toil required far in the shade .
And quit the flowers that summer brings [ d ]
It is not hard to bear by faith ,
Earnest the pilot 's eyes sought cape or bay ,
The cooling breeze as winter comes apace
The friar saw the conflict from a knoll ,
They send over convicts to strengthen our mob --
Went dripping music through her thought .
When friendly glances meet , -- then silent ease
" with true love trembling at the brim ,
Light through the sky as on it passed .
To thee i lost virginity and life .
Weaving the fancies suiting such a day .
What fear hath stirred them to provoke the war ?
If our intemperate youth the vessel drains ?
The yellow fog came creeping down
Can scarce his tainted purity restore . _
To set on fire whoever bars his road .
't is making this old world thrill and glow
My life could show some kindness done ,
Expressed such terror
The haughty prince that england owns ,
To what i feel is lord of all ,
This cheered her heart although her face grew pale
But her hairband caught the open window —
The jasmine , throwing wide her elegant sweets ,
And a silence that is made
In merry chorus well combined ,
How to the circle fitted , and therein
That flow from a spell bound heart ?
For wasted days of youth to make atone
And the moon sinks , and drowsy stars appear ,
And if their smiles encountered , he went mad ,
Like them our hearts still closer crept ,
Aghast to feel that praying lips refused
( he came only for decorum ,
" leap the grades of life and light ,
The lights on brimming crystal fell ,
His empty hands turned down in sign of torture .
Doubted the swain , and a while did stand
And italy 's indanger 'd peace restore .
The nearest portion of the city rose ,
Had got the house -- and left her starving .
Our hearts shall meet as once of yore
Plunged in the depth of helpless poverty .
He is bringing a day with glad pulses beating ,
Till as the moon crept slowly forth , she stood
" and wisdom comes by looking eye to eye ,
And spark like rainbows in their little fractures .
And free to gama all his kingdom lies .
Then from achilles chased the mist away :
You bring back the days departed ,
You may forget the warmth he gave ,
And fall in love ?
A turquoise lighting a ground of green .
Bid it rise boldly at the signal given .
It fits thee now to wear a dark disguise ,
Tolling the silence as a bell .
Turning the brown of youth to white and old
The grand menagerie paintings hide :
And the maidens ' eyes shed tear-drops ,
Fell with him ; loud his polished armour rang .
His voice was buried among trees ,
The curling waters round the galleys roar .
To free the hollow heart from paining --
For deep the grass and bushes lie below ,
Making a famine where abundance lies ,
The wheelbarrow broke , my wife got a fall ,
How excellent to thus make expiation ,
Though his alone the blood that flecks the ground ,
Deep in my soul there came an answering voice :
Then menelaus , prayer preferring first
Which has never stinted its ice-cold waters
Though the night was made for loving ,
Come thou not near that film so finely spread ,
And thus with joyful words addressed :
Nor can blame cling to thee ; the snow
Through frosty hills the journey lay ,
Then came nearer -- fresher , fuller ,
That many a season lent its shade ,
The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb .
Fainter grew the yells of tigers ,
Each creature , as a letter filling it .
Fast she flew ; the flames spread faster ,
Which greed has woven for humanity ,
Nor how he injured me time serves to tell ,
That should make glad some paradise ! --
The mist blew from the sea ,
A blast of gabriel 's horn has torn away
And brushes of bristle we 'll make for sale ,
Thought-dazzling spot that set ablaze the blood ,
The glorious saint agastya showed ,
My verses i will weave as , at their doors
The fear that shrivels us in choking rinds
There many a riddle to unravel .
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;
Youth and activity will take the lead .
And love 's kind sacrifice can open them .
Whose waters feed the fountain 's lip ,
That sent him south so goodly a knight .
To rise into splendor and fill a high station ;
Sought with the scourge to make mankind his slaves ,
She is the soul that comes and goes
To-day a token of affection gave ,
And merely given to the cold bleak air .
Fierce plagues , my hand shall kill . ”
As by thy cruel predecessors has been shown :
That carries an affected air ;
Its truth was hidden , and its light obscured
Take from our eyes the glory of great flight .
And all , by common terror moved ,
Whence came the tumult , moved the scottish peer ;
Who went to thank her ;
Each following night reversed the toils of day .
Wisdom made him old and wary
Sends the fever from the marshes ,
To hide with flowers the curse upon the hills ,
Reward upon his wing doth go :
Making thee hungry and cold ,
When freely gushed all feelings forth ,
For if our fleet your navy chase or take ,
When juno to her handmaid gives command ,
And spend in solitude life 's little day ,
The rainbow 's glory is shed .
Where any one can take a look and see ,
It seemed so frightened where it rose !
Can rouse such emotion
Another line ran —
Less of herself than sex the fault he read ,
In praise of those who her glad tidings bring ,
God grant me life to cheer with love
And join paternal with maternal care ;
Of terror , and abhorrence , nature throws
We watched pompeii come to prayer --
By love and warm desires fed .
And the sea swallowed his body ,
Swift as the hurrying shuttles go ,
Where chestnut blooms made sweet the breath of night ,
Sickens at midday , nor can face for terror
To leaping life , and thought sustaining thought ,
Also , who laid the rainbow 's piers ,
Thus ráma gave his sorrow vent ,
Yet would i fain bring guilt to shame ;
Fishers that on the high cliff make their haunt
They are binding up their hearts away from breaking ,
What his skillful hands have fashioned .
With pride that bore no name ;
Joy will fill it ,
And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane :
But with the sweet grave eyes his hands had wrought
The filmy and flickering forest , to start out again
No dogmas nail your faith ; and what remains
From his lady 's white hand caught ;
The hours i spent with thee , dear heart ,
Destin 'd to meet with hate .
To sons and saints he gave the word ,
And to the people 's spirit power brought .
The bases on which god and man stand sure
The embodied sage , withdrawn within his soul ,
The constellations meet , but through benign
It made man 's flesch to creepen ,
Cold in his arms it lies ;
To think sleep had revived a thing so dead .
But in that air with laughter stirred ,
And as he lay ther forto die ,
Then , sprung of woe , from eyes of all
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths ,
In myrtle groves and alleys hide their woes ,
How sweet this english garden grows ,
The words of wisdom pour .
Read where the comfort came ,
And death and havoc hold the famished land .
You get about the best thing god invents :
The old wind stirs the hawthorn tree ;
A skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart ,
Have helped to bruit your beauty 's fame .
Where once the sleepless dragon held his watch ,
And clouds , clouds , clouds go by ,
That year in killingworth the autumn came
How the daisies stared ....
A thousand voices called to me .
To drink from her perpetual fount of joy .
Without the misery gleaming in his eye ,
I watch you when the wind has come , --
Where love himself imprison 'd lies ,
There rings the joyous peacock ’s scream ,
Made my face brighter than a bride 's .
And clamours through the wild air flying !
Yet i knew it meant to me
Which plainly shows the fortune one 's to have ,
He resurrection-truth brought forth to light ,
A sudden rapture filled his heart ,
Listless he lay , and with indifferent eye
Of years commanded . next th ' athenian realm
Within the gates , proud sinon throws about
And make its firm foundations sure .
His peaceful woods contain .
And straight the vision fled . a female next
My soul in agony cried out to god ,
Are frae their nuptial labours risen :
Own gold seems captured by the weeds ;
't is not her there you see ,
And the wild waves of ocean rolled
May join our worship here ,
The human soul that through me ran ;
Which a man who was really a carpenter made .
At the strange sounds made by the owl ,
While then came the thoughts of years soon sped ,
Forge new ideas , changing as they act ;
Brother year was _ gone _ !
That joy so rarely rises to the brim ;
And bring that joy of morning back to me .
That life 's storm crushed and left to lie below
The appointed bound is placed !
And tried and manly hearts surround them .
But suffering brought me friends , the officers
Set the traveller on his way ,
Where the dark mounds in silence and loneliness stand ,
That calls from hell or plunges into night
And never feel the dire effects of change .
The gay who find aught to wake laughter ,
But man associated and leagued with man
Laden with cares , with pleasures worn ,
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes .
A storm of sparkles and of flames arise .
Spread its unbroken silence over all ,
Then waters on the wrinkled pond take fright ;
Feelings glow and fade again !
I sweep and churn , save and contrive ,
All ages call thee conqueror , and thy cry
As could be covered by a single stroke ,
Age might but take the things youth needed not !
My heart is weary , my peace is gone ,
Nor reared a shrine to mock her loveliness ;
Roses lay in the road before them ,
No , my heart has never tired of you .
As ever fell to fairy 's lot
Love 's light summer-cloud sweetly shall cast .
But chief tydides bore the sovereign sway :
This echo comes to me .
Behold , his mournful followers bear him slain !
A gracious smile , that seems to say --
Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life ,
Deep silence reigned , save when a gust
Of mad delight they drop their spoils , and bound
The sun came dazzling through the leaves ,
The thunder of taman lowed like a bull .
Till underneath his glorious branches laid
The flower that once has blown for ever dies .
Bottoms as good as euer spread a clue :
When the twilight turned to darkness ,
And death and starvation scowled in his look . --
Instinct with eden 's brightness drew .
For grecian woes nor care nor pity feels .
When first to her fond gaze is given
And blaze the butterflies !
That gently shakes the rustling trees --
Her shining eyes suffused with tears , came nigh
Thee i beheld , upon that highway drawn ,
From the floor the child made answer :
Is it dawn that is breaking ? ... no ,
And i will show thee wherein lies the spell ,
A double share of valour brought .
Good the bride that ukko gives thee ,
Fortune favours them at fishing .
But the thing that 's got me nippy
Be chased by the pale artisan ?
That kissed the maiden all forlorn
So fades the sunshine of the breast ,
With nothing but naughts to follow ,
Over the purple mists that hide the gulf .
Yet , let not haughty reason 's bounded line
And , tho ' you make the critics cross ,
His note was trenchant , turning kind .
Call up thy power and strength to-day .
Old porches it discloses
Humanity lies gasping and becalmed
Whatever joy was left on earth ,
( the misty clouds about their foreheads fly ; )
When ebbing life nae mair shall flow ,
Remembrances of thee will not be lost .
Or , if the starting burst of rage succeed ,
He blew them at vittoria .
We thought them fit for a queen .
But mirth is turned to melancholy ,
Springtime saw him calm and gentle ,
And the bee she thus directed :
The highest ills your malice can prepare .
And in the midst a trap there stood ,
For the structure that we raise ,
And , fleeing god 's express design , trace back
And lessen naught thy wrath and anger fell .
The wisdom making passage through our slough .
There are peaceful nooks where the soul might dwell
Oft made thee , in thy gloom , despair .
In came the mother , wild with joy :
To hear , and sink again to sleep !
Withered and limp and dead laid their fair brows .
Step by step , when i feel my strength decay
The burial office read ,
With her then , as in humble duty bound ,
No pipers ever took that road , --
As it feared that a popular lie was told .
Here and no further learning 's channels ran ;
And raven ringlets gather 'd in dark crowd
The one he seemed to run a race ,
As the heart would remember when told to forget ?
Dispersed left their blood their brains and bones .
Catch the quick smile , and his attentive ear .
Divine , these curious fabrics wrought .
Blinded by the light that glared ,
But the blood gushed forth in torrents ,
And felt the silence , the dusk , the dread
And pleased away went hop , hop , hop .
My signature graved there when earth was young ,
One only grief they feel . -- shall she
Answered in the words which follow :
Nor vainly to the sphinx thy voice was raised !
By mella 's winding waters gather it .
Time wore to six . her husband rose
An eye , that with fierce hatred burned ,
Of shouting hosts commingling shook the world .
Our voices only broke the gloom .
That had so long remained ,
Be fame their mistress whom love passes by .
When the warriors plan for battle . "
Against the crime of law , which gave
And love should lead , if love be true ,
And i will follow as your answers ran . '
And lone before her still the long road lies ?
And his possessions lay ; there i abode
For life as running water lost its charm
That makes a radius of every glance ,
The ravage earth may bear no more ,
The flowered solstice comes indeed , but never
Where dreams come true .
A steed was brought by trembling hands , he sprang
With its tongue the harp made answer ,
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
In whom her rapture a great radiance made .
That is my comfort , following shock on shock ,
This life glowed ,
And on the watery waves went forth alone
We feed the kindling flame of art ,
Some cloud that hides a hurricane ;
Whose righteous soul observes each trust .
O’er countless bands his pennons fly ;
To bring a spirit from the circle of judas ;
Breaking his solitude , to towns .
Watching the unreturning ships go forth
To descant on the doubts of my decay .
A wreath she 'll wind , a fragrant treasure ;
Life sheds its dreams that no new spring recalls ;
And with the flower 's loosened loneliness
In veins rolled tumbling around ;
But there came no other answer
Answered in the words which follow :
That always bears the noblest breed of men .
There comes the voice that circumvents the gale ;
With a pale and sickly glare , now freely shines
When western winds on curling waters play .
Or white death holdeth me ?
And venus , which hath also take
That i take heed and do no ill ,
Commissioners , to pursue certain negotiations for a marriage
That flushed her cheeks with crimson ,
I find i ’ve been waiting for nine .
Shed light upon the scene ,
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew ,
To wring from out thy soul a cry
Watch them like stars set in a lonely sky ,
That day and night he comfortably spent ;
In everything there naturally grows
And merriment , that used to make our lives
For health and joy shall light each cheek ;
These are the works that occupy
Where has love led and beckoned me
By homespun beauty poured !
The little things life rested on
The golden pomp is come .
Ere death filled all its sky ;
To which this legend runs , the white
There , where reply to innocence is made .
That leaves no trace of thorn ?
But every season fills the foaming pail .
With living sapphires : hesperus , that led
A futile weapon ; yet the sad scrolls tell
My stainless life would try to stain ,
And stir up generations with warm life ,
White spirits loosed from bonds of mortal birth ,
And the noose floats free for all ? '
Our steps , that passed at will
And driving the dreary old seers into rages --
Blossoms are waving above its brim ,
Hearts were aching , hearts were breaking , lashes
Seldom with his heart do meet .
The boundless waters as they roll , --
Thy heart hath given its winter to the sky !
The clouds that hung in threatening o'er the land
Inspiring terror , their attack was made .
Nor those that placed beneath his utmost reign
Sweet flowers , that she treads on ,
Torture is theirs , what they inflict they feel .
Should lead you into hatred
Their skilful hands they ply : their toil forgot
Till such a wild heart rending moan hath risen ,
For ornament the trojan hero brought ,
And a shout went round the board ,
But therewithal the tremulous silence said :
Seek me the heart that never ached ,
With every joy to take the mind ,
Then , with his temper growing wusser .
Each month more beautiful sprang from a robe discarded ,
Who sunk in arms to everlasting night ,
Back to the headless trunk at speed he bore ,
Until the god cast down his garb of clay ,
A tear stood in her eye ;
Where pleasures met , at last do find
And banish tears and gloom .
Each moment lost and kindled , while around ,
The active virtue , being made a soul
The face that hovered over me in dream ,
The voice and bore it to the hollow wood ,
By all who held the city consecrate
To christine 's eyes revealed the golden helm .
By awful juno this command is given ;
And spirits meet where once they sinned ,
And , still with yearning hearts our eyes explore ,
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
Rich store of merit has my labour won .
The sunshine 's gone , and now an april evening
To him , such cares revolving in his breast ,
Is the wee blink that shines in a tear .
Which means the usual sort of lies
But all transfigured with angelic light !
Nor show me such similitude of god .
There were twelve resolutions that instantly passed ,
To breathe their marvellous notes i try ;
Hast rendered me security , and drawn me
Was it the wild wind kept you thus
The sun of righteousness bestowed on them .
With song think i to make me joy .
Hearts set about with gold encompassed them .
The songbird thoughts flit to and fro .
While peace possess 'd these silent bowers ,
This day , time winds th ' exhausted chain ,
Used each stolen kiss to bring !
No repentance bring him low !
High honour and respect may claim .
For having lost but once your prime ,
In the sea springs up a mountain ,
Light songs and ditties sought ,
No more old england will they see
How quick to take advice .
My love came to that door ;
When tis supprest with fanning fires first came .
But juan turn 'd his eyes on the sweet child
The swallow 's gone , the daisy cowers --
And go the week about , nine times in ten
To such entreaty answer thus was made :
Nature allows us to bait for the fool .
The consecrating drops are shed .
Where waters with a naiad runs ,
Thus come into his adversaries ' hands . "
O ' balls was felt to be severe ,
To bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss .
Captivity led captive through the aire ,
Than it harbours thoughts of grief ,
The honours masonic prepare for to throw ;
The islands feel the enclasping flow ,
Took his soul , his ghost , his shadow ,
The monarch in the dust laid low .
Those divinest eyes can bring
And yearns , so nature 's lessons teach ,
That in this cavern rests his plundered wealth :
Here in green meadows sits eternal may ,
To him who took his rest whene'er
Four bright eyes that found life lovely ,
And there the bow which great ulysses bore ;
The journey now embarked upon by me .
Till thousand stars leap with their visiting :
Thus was the error fixed ; and it is well
Leave thee naked to laughter ,
I take my goosequill for some recreation ,
And the world is made anew ;
Her blush was rippling with a smile
I too felt the air of june
May health an ' strength their toils reward ,
That e'er created fury dared to raise ?
Both bring one death ; and i die here
To whom she thus address 'd her deep despair :
And the pride of a prince you feel .
Joy grows holy , grief takes rest ,
These grow in spight of misery ,
You purchase pain with all that joy can give ,
They held their pilgrim way .
Then my spirit drooped as the night came on ,
Entranced , and all the blissful haunts surveyed .
Its splendour lit the subterraneous room .
Triumphs and hatred followed : i myself
A grateful people raise th ' historic stone ;
Dancing to meet my thoughts if they invite --
The pitying heart that felt for human woe ;
Havoc will reign when next the sun shall rise .
All my soul a silence kept --
As that old time shall endure .
And , bathed in glories red and gold ,
Save he would lose his syrian chivalry ,
That bearing children made such a change .
Of purple , swinging streaming censers
His arm but breaks the fall : the panting breast
Some nimbly run o'er hills and valleys light ,
Each goes robbing for himself .
To be against its nature tied ,
That book will pass from hand to hand ,
The fiery glimmer of eve dies dimmer ,
To which dark rocks a grateful coolness gave ,
I cast these lyric offerings at your feet ,
All the beer has left the goblets ,
Now holy peace may smile from heaven ,
A careless smile was seen to play ,
The hapless heart that 's stung by thee ! "
Ambrosial , breathing forth such odours sweet ,
So her young days for ever had swept by ,
In the cold my song was resting ,
Concealed , because with ours their progress lay . '
And form a picture to the admiring sight .
That made mankind the friend of man ! --
Gilt over by the light i bore in me ,
With the fond wish to form a softer sex ;
And straightway they took fright .
And the years rolled swiftly onward ;
Here gentler edward claims a pitying sigh ,
A thousand rills their mazy progress take :
Now tiding give how long i shall live ,
Time was ! eternity now reigns alone :
Came a cold , sudden breath that made the hair
For more perfection than this state can bear
But the rich win compassion . god is just ,
And made a great chord tranquil-surfaced so ,
Give thee full license to instill
Until they reach 'd a desert wide ,
In eastern lands his fame prevails
Upon the cradle 's side her light touch keeping ,
With greater puissance meets the coming foe .
And cunning way to turn the public scale ?
Show man was made to mourn .
O will you take the lonely road ,
Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim ,
God first made man , then found a better way
Her face is lit with splendour ,
And dim the beauty writ about in books ;
I 'll lay one more kiss on her .
With never a banner above them spread ,
A mighty warrior , mightily he lay .
For the cross which here we bore ;
If impiously an earthly realm i take .
There shines an armed angel like a star ,
We worship at its shrine and feel its thrill ;
The snow is lying very deep .
Blue-eyed and pale came children of the dawn
Just brings to me the same old pay .
The weapon grasping , with a lion 's rage
Every substantial form , that segregate
To get where life begins , and still we groan
The devil ’s neck asunder went ,
And on the air there rises dire lament
It is december matched with may ,
Tears fell , when thou wert dying ,
What relief it would give to my heart !
With laughter lit , or in surprise ,
No more her pulses come and go ;
Thou hast but now a promise made ,
A motto she often has put on her sign .
Verse , a breeze ' mid blossoms straying
Where thunder torrents rolled .
So the kings drew him from that stricken field
But secret unseen threads went floating out :
To the girl the crone made answer ,
The furious barb snorts fire and foam ,
But such plain roofs as piety could raise ,
On which it stood ; great changes have been wrought
Against the war had angus stood ,
And paying each other a visit ,
Dark with lowering fate ,
If it be not that evil seeks to pierce
And felt determined constant war to wage
A countenance in which did meet
The settling billows tremble . -- morning steals
Before the wide-winged word takes flight
See , revolution rears his hydra-head !
The word that hides a thousand fears , --
And all my bonds aside were cast ,
But first he went new armour to
Pain melted in tears , and was pleasure ;
The rains arise , and fires their warmth dispense ,
When change itself can give no more ,
Does he carry this vision of heretofore :
" we 'll reach our marriage bed . "
The income that his rank demanded
And all his malice , all his craft is shown
There lay the cold keys of the citadel .
Only torment will she bring .
We shall make question of ourselves : what tie
His hindward charms gleam an unearthly white .
No more will beat the sweet alarm ,
Still follow thy lord ,
The victor-wreath , what time the shepherd bore
Shall to life those forms restore ,
Who laid their hearts and fortunes at your feet .
Which puzzled nature much to know what art meant .
A rising murmur runs along the line .
Do greatly in a universe that breaks
Who , when maganza 's traitors made repair ,
And ere the robin got a spune ,
Freedom yet shall summon allies
But it brought a glimpse of summer
Glimmered through drifting gulfs of silver fleece ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Unto that birth most wondrous , that had grown
There comes a word to man and beast
A childish fear steals over me .
I thank you for the pleasure you have given ;
In circle by the lusty friskers gripped ,
The guests are met , the feast is set :
The blood of countless martyrs freely flowed ,
The outcast see them shine like angels ' eyes ,
Taking for subject of its muse ,
And captive their defenceless people takes .
Airs drift across the twilight border land ,
You shall find other , nobler ways than mine
And made it in the sketch its being leave .
Because his eyes compelled them like a law .
When victory seem 'd to hover near .
Give heaven the light of thine !
Endure your grief , and ask no sympathy !
That ruby bears a stamp thou canst not see
Her whole face lit as by an inward flame
Is a glory that never will fade away .
The time approached , to church the parties went ,
Love : the earthly love thou losest
At the loud shriek that round them rang ,
Both his eyeballs flashing lightning ;
Where shall i run to hide my grief ?
To shine on some slumbering chinese town .
To know if any to a wife were tied ;
With asses all his time he spent ,
Filling the room with their fragrant scent .
But oh , for those this day can bring ,
Her passion driven by a rapturous will
By all those tears that have been shed ,
For us he bears the sultry day ,
All suddenly there comes a sense of peace
But shall in rustic darknes ever lie ,
But all transfigured with angelic light !
Shall stand to preach good tidings to the meek ,
Whose gentleness gave grace to so much pride --
It is her silence binds me unreleased ,
Our way we held , more rugged than before ,
And by the magic light , astonished , throw .
As on the soft air rose and fell
Never any day that passes
To know when ancient constellations rise ?
Filled with rare chambers was the rich abode .
Where do flowers go when they die ?
For , suddenly shook by a terrible fright ,
To set the cause above renown ,
For lo , the funds went sudden crashing down ,
Just as the sun went bathing in a sea
Sudden great guns startle , echoing on the silence .
And where it goes i too shall go .
For i am sprung from an illustrious sire ,
All praise to him who each stream fills ;
And leave enough purpose and time for another
But over him a drowsiness was cast ,
A pious magistrate ! sound his praise throughout
In the very words which follow :
Within that house the king did lie :
Night fell . i heard his tread ,
I saw the seated mountains split ,
Tidings , which ill the afflicted champion bore ,
There the luver 's treasure lies .
In rising cadence , played within mine ears ,
It dance as they go blowing by .
A mist swept in across the sea ...
Through the clouds had fallen downward ,
These silly clerkes runnen up and down
Shall tend to consummation of its course ,
Could gain an hour 's delay .
Her mind resolved through thinking she could serve
Famine makes thy father reckless ,
But the dolefu ' bugle brings
Will she recall the eyes of brown
Her white limbs bared of all her golden hair ,
Upon her wings presents the god unshorn .
The great tides come and go .
Can make my sick brain reel .
But as the shadows fall i see
Then foul contagion filled the murky air
They make soft peace with men .
And in your blissful errand reach the spot .
Youth and joy ; so jove hath sworn .
Lapping the soul in a crystal sea ,
No spring within her bosom came to pass .
So many prevailing pity turn the scale ! "
Life cradled our son in the atom
The dew and heat , whose bubbles make
Where once the roman galley sped ,
By love and duty led . they will not cease
Proud paris , and they reached the river strand ,
The flowers that sweetest breathe ,
Virtue subdues the fates , but can not blind
The wild bee rests a moment where
Just to feed its flame ;
As day by day went fleeting on its course ,
For nought but what thy happiness could spare .
Her slumbers broke , the vision fled ;
Of merry ones that skip it ;
The vagrant wind came through the opened blind ,
Each heart was bounding then .
From the ancient moon that gazeth from afar ,
Where the lilies draggle the bank .
The god for her had bred this punishment , --
Of virtue which thy children hold ,
Along his pathway rolled .
What sudden pangs shot thro ' each aching heart ,
Make way for liberty , and died .
In civil conflict met on bosworth-field ,
Greater freedom 's sun shall rise .
The sounding battles leave him nodding still :
Singing of sweet birds unto love inclined ,
The woe-born tears were running fast
Saint michael 's chapel cuts the sky .
For christmas comes but once a year ,
Here take we counsel fully , if to fall
From nature 's altar falls the sacred fire ,
Each gave with sighs her last adieu ,
Was greeted by a joyous note .
Which in the final judgment thou shalt see . "
For faith betrayed and pledges broken ,
The young year sets the buds astir ,
Filled me with sickly terror and dismay .
And the heathen lands explore ,
By raising a hard-worked farmer 's rent ;
Kissing cold stones , the women shrink for drought .
The painted love that hung on irised wings
From room to room the wind went shuddering
When after it the weary eyelids fall
But when the melancholy fit shall fall
Found favour , from her it was gathered most .
A song made in the rebellion .
When gloves are giving , gilded be you there .
And in a slow , sad channel went ,
The merchant sees the gathering danger rise ,
They ' as 'em set .
Was touched by god in some exalted place ;
Their hundred hats they raise !
From pine-knots catch their evening flame :
But not her chance to sometimes find
The coof wad never leave her ,
Her benediction smiles upon this spot ,
At last there came a pause of brutal force ;
The story actually goes , that he
Dull listener , placed amidst the harmonious whole ,
And smoky torches made a glare
Danger was coming , so swift , so swift ,
A melancholy spectre rose in view ,
Than love can ever say .
Where stars stare down with sharpened faces
I stopped , and two beheld i show great haste
Or some choice virtue run to seed ;
When the eve-star keeps watch alone ,
Yet hypocrite fanatics cry ,
Out of the longings which nothing could fill ;
Truth , weeping , tells the mournful tale ,
And i recalled the features of forese .
And lines that shadow 'd stern and grim ,
The deadly signal flew ; and ever the sea
Will bring a tempest ere the night ,
Love , born in hours of joy and mirth ,
The sun all embraces dividing .
His eyes with tears ran over ,
With constance came a friend of earlier years ,
Now his sore body made his temper sore .
A little garland fits a little head ,
The weapon sped or vain , but pierced profound
The basest weed outbraves his dignity :
Thou once more shalt go to battle ,
Harmless things that hide and peer ,
When sickness makes him pale and wan .
Forced by repeated insults to return ,
At times she was filled with religious devotion ,
By a misty fen that rang all night ,
" he who hath made the night of stars
" scarce my demand was made , before mine eye
On the soft currents that go forth and wind
While ever clearer came the dropping notes ,
Out of their very beauty driven to dare
Chased the shadows from my brow .
With blinding brilliance crowned by vivid flame .
Which makes the heart of nature glad ;
Strength i have borrowed from the outward show
This region of sin that you find you in ,
The rising tempest leapt and roared ,
The combat seemed , and trouble tossed them sore ,
Smiles wander o'er thy placid face
Is caught in her eyes as fire
May serve to put thee still in mind
And with it carries me .
With heaven 's high will prepared to suffer more .
Though threatening fate his hopes assail ,
And find that fortune will by fits rebel .
The fury of their charge could stay .
And seemed to listen , till he caught
For every man it hath supposed ,
Like one whose shattered bark is lost .
The darling 's sorrow gives me pain .
His fatal snares to meet .
Or worry when the market drops ,
The trunks they spring from . there an oak
The tyrian train , admitted to the feast ,
That follow some long-dreamed-of quest !
Then she spoke the words which follow :
Of greeks , and kissed his neck and flashing eyes
His spirit within him sinking . on the plain
The rich man 's thou mayst take . "
And calling truth to be his guide ,
A fair young face on which a shadow lies ;
My mother died : nights passed and mornings came ,
And in each pause the story made
Thus rose the cry of wild despair
Believin ' it is honesty that pays ;
The crisp white clouds go sailing by ,
Pallid death holds reverie ;
I will follow and rejoice
Now , had this needle turned its eye
In music would all drift here naturally .
Had sprung the uncouth defending deity ;
And ran triumphantly his course ,
Till life turned drowsy with the ceaseless note ;
Your memory has not had time to pass ;
Your graces , which have made me great ,
You are like spring returned through snow .
And take the painful sense of toil away .
Or of what oven felt the heat ,
Edwin , of melody aye held in thrall ,
The real temper must at home be seen .
And as they the rivers followed ,
The welcome of a foe will give . ”
You 're getting quite a high renown ;
Give peace to hoodooed men : --
Leave all things to the builder of the heavens .
That make life youth . "
As priests , were added the pinarian house ,
Bear all the mean and buzzing grievances ,
Where the silence cried aloud ;
Kindled , thy ken a higher flight shall mount ;
The foe is found , beats or is beaten ,
When any one it makes to thirst for it .
Shall ring in heavenly chant upon thine ear ;
Sighing through all her works gave signs of woe ,
To tell to trembling saul his hour was come .
The billows toss our bark on high ,
Where the honeysuckle climbs ,
More golden where the sunlight falls ; --
As i pass to the beach , art stirred ?
My strength should not suffice to sing their fate ,
Some fire of madness lit that tiny brain ,
Divides , and kindles into rhythmic dance ?
And thy protection from their aid withdraw .
Nor spread arachne o'er her curious loom .
Yes , made a vow to god ;
Into his presence led by fortune be ,
Till copious wealth might guard his regal state .
You will draw hints of that vision
Which made a wiser man than thou once err
To find the spring of youth at last ,
" in stars that wink or flowers that blow ,
Trembles , and all the flowers die where it hovers
And keeping all that softens and adorns
And her i ’ll hold in respect and love ,
Summer woods , about them blowing ,
And my heart stood still to hear .
Whether to settle peace , or to unfold
Of the rushing , pouring sound of the sea
Where golden portals flashed between
Tender eyes that will shine like stars
Whose vanity flew round him , only while fed
Short sighs and sobs succeed ; till sorrow breaks
And lit the rocks that held her pent .
Gathering her brows like gathering storm ,
But his face was calm though his pulses leapt .
And greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give .
The warfare to maintain above one day ;
As march turns april , and the hours bring
And the sweet waves his strength restore .
Are shining on the sad abodes of death ,
Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
And casting off the veil in falling shows --
Or driving clouds have sail 'd the wave before ;
But who could bear that gloomy blank
For lessons brighter than the stars can give ,
By each step in half-blindness taken --
That leaves a track of glory on the sky ;
And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun ?
And gives the answer that she seeks .
When on my breast thy head in slumber lies ,
Shown resentment at the outrage .
Then added , turning grave from gay ;
Her tables loaded with the fruit of kings ,
To follow them : but chiefly where
A fort they reared upon this summit bleak
Joy reigned in the fullness of her grace .
Where have i heard that aching tune ,
And they , her smiles of love caress 'd ,
And peace and joy in every grove shall dwell .
So frightful are the forms the monster takes ,
All earth can give must pass away --
That fairy scene went on ;
To live for him who gave me life ;
By every wind that comes this way ,
As great birds rise from the sod ,
Indulged the day that housed their annual grain ,
The sun hurried into a cloud ; and the trees
To pray , repent , and bring obedience due .
Is void ) , the same hath made my cemetery
What cause hath moved apollo to this wrath ,
In all things that to greatest actions lead .
There runs a road by merrow down --
In scripture trained with graces fair ,
Can france uphold them in their proud demand ,
The restful caves now restless visions give ;
All things proceed , and up to him return ,
" like clouds that shape themselves and go . "
Henceforth this usage ever should maintain ;
The victory complete and victor crowned :
All felt displeasure ; when to them arose
The first act shows the simple country maid ,
Each to-day is heavier made ;
So many there , no measure could he set .
Disconsolate , long since adventure fled ;
That quadrants joining in a circle make .
So lay this seed -- a village fair --
I once was pia . sienna gave me life ,
A tempest should arise
Until the rose roused all its blood ,
The birches swung from shrieks to sighs ;
That made the distant welkin ring .
They rest beyond the speech of human pride
When sleep has locked his senses in repose
Thus made reply : " he is indeed alive ,
And oft a glance he cast towards the wine
This put mr. frog in a terrible fright ;
Trembled visibly yet ; for she could not but feel
That hangs before her all the year ,
Must wander thirty-fold for all the time
And guests in prouder homes shall see ,
Who founds in error elevates a sin .
That goes pulling the moon
Who , lost to sense of generous freedom past ,
On a slight raft to pass the swelling sea ,
The gem finds favor in thine eyes . ”
All my feeble strength is worn ,
Of his dark eyebrows bending sternly down !
Did feel their tears and hear their sighs .
Death came mantling on his brow ,
And a voice came to my ear ,
Myself in days gone by : again i give
Where it lay in place of rafael 's glory ,
Yet lay the weight so close about
The clouds went over their heads
Prostrate they lay their lips and from the depths
And the snow came up and the fire it flew
With fatal , fatal love a girlhood goes .
And neither cloud conceal , nor misty air
Though on my mind no light is shed ,
Their little polished paunch they fill .
Till all the fumes of slumber are brushed by ,
To leave the passage free in church and street .
The birds , who make sweet music for us all
The boys put up the shutters and ran hooting
Sweet blossoms spring up in the dust .
Must needs have moved my laughter : now remains
Not with bare justice shall your act be crowned ,
The sun in veil of double darkness made ;
Like tops across a table , gathering speed
By day the dream had faded to a mist
Solitude slowly steals ,
For the white drift shalt thou meet ,
Lest we should feel the straining skies
He gave a refuge to the homeless --
To make the ripple of her laugh .
Come out ere your mood turns to blaming ,
To ferry over the sad world that came . "
O muse ! the causes and the crimes relate ;
A single sin destroys the fruit of many virtues .
Where tears of penance come too late for grace ,
To count the beauty worth my wish or gain ,
To urge the gloomy wanderer o'er the wave ?
What 's passed between us . "
Earth folds dark blankets round the violet blue .
I read and felt that i was there . "
Dennis bought chocolate to make a feast --
And oft the votaress heaved a sigh .
Although it lay so neer and faire ,
Flashed on each murk and murderous meeting-time ,
Who holds the country toward the distant sea .
Black clouds , rising out
Two infant rivers pour the crystal tide ,
My little islands as my tombstones stand ,
And crooked shapes of terror crouched ,
May ye get mony a merry story ,
Endeares affection , and doth make it grow .
Her artless strain made him refrain
Nor wealth of peoples given to our command .
His guardian angel sheds a pitying tear ; --
Here , days and nights their circuits make :
Have made him shine a figure through the ages ;
The downward garment shows the ambiguous breast ;
And every heart with triumph filled .
Which fast beside the beauteous altar raised
Just flecked with spots of sunshine here and there ,
And to repentance and confession turn 'd ;
Till the noise of war swept over me ,
The honour of these noble boughs down threw :
And windy trees blown silver in the sun ,
Oh , dinna cross the burn .
Happy , bear it to thy husband .
Of fair queen summer , buried in her bloom .
That made your men the slaves of kings !
By a dread parting was thy fame acquired ,
The bond which nature gives ,
Star-words , which quicker reach the sense ;
“ of manly beauty caught , she now contemns
Behold tiresias , who his semblance changed ,
Of thee what word remains ere speech be still ?
The good ones , after every action closes
Of death hunts happily for evermore . --
Which sorrow alone can expand .
It 's coming yet , for a ' that ,
But my heart it will not rest .
The brightest wit can find us ;
Could stretch to look at me .
There rose up a remembrance of his keen ,
On whom as yet sorrow has laid no scar ,
Tempted by folly every scene pursue ,
While thus to him her griefs orlando showed ,
We slip the world 's gray husk ,
Or , if some neighbor , flying from disease ,
The prayer that waits for him ; and trembling strive
The dewberry dipped for to work delay ,
The secret that so long had hovered
He brought report that his own eyes had seen
Now spring has clad the grove in green
In mine own region ? who the chart shall draw
In melancholy loneliness , and swept
When poverty sits cursing the man of large estate ,
And wasted carvings passed antique research ;
Your words , for worldly hearts look up to you
The spring spills blue --
That from his open mouth comes . josef lingers
It shines like the fabled fleece of gold !
So got a visit , sooner than expected .
When the red dust has cleared , the lonely soldier
About finding a happiness out of the psalms ;
But thy spirit found the earth
That beckons to me from the regions of light ,
The truths thy life hath said .
And left their music lingering on its strings .
Our maker knows , give him your fervent prayers :
Till thy whole self in every fibre find
" orange and green will carry the day . "
Why does destruction linger on her way !
To-morrow would have given him power
Wi ' twey words spoke ' suddently .
To find , alas ! that days are years ,
To follow ráma brave and true ,
My water-butt ran with wine ,
My heart lay numb within me ; and the flow
And to thee altars raise ,
And lent them charms they did not bring ; --
Where cottages ' mong gardens stood
Nor council here nor session hath been held
Fled the false shame that yet had lingered there ,
Not him shall the fortune of war ever show .
The city turned to caesar : and the foe ,
And their own loss , but never give relief ;
It folds its wings like some contented bird .
Rest had come ! his tasks were ended ,
When now he saw the city set aflame
Who filled thy countenance with rosy light ?
Therefore i lift my weary eyes -- no more .
Hushed is each doubt , gone every fear ;
This grief which fills thee with despair ,
Where disappointment shades the scene :
The giant valleys gulp the night ;
Soon came a third , your love to win ,
And rank with herbs which baleful odours breathed ,
And sang , while stillness grew more still
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw :
It stands upon my honour
( all take pensions but from her ) ;
According to the virtue it conceives ,
When roland saw that life had fled ,
But went straightway .
And rising turned upon me with a smile ,
To coasts left bitter by the tide ,
That then you shall go on with sorrow deep .
But human frailty can not gaze
But lips where smiles went out and in ;
And held sincere communion with the lord ,
Himself to sing , and build the lofty rhyme .
Are lost in passion 's storm .
I lift my heart as spring lifts up
And her woe began to run afresh ,
His heart hung all upon a silken dress ,
Picture on picture passed before him there
The silence of the grave now broods around !
And he went up wind as a racer goes .
Jean , whose laughter flashed over depths of terror ,
Come the darker , sadder sights ;
Mamurra stuck to theophrastus ,
Her limbs had left , as pure and warm ,
And matchless fame his youth attend .
And , acting on the plans well laid ,
But long ere night , cut down , it lies
The strangest whim has seized me ... . after all
Tears of rapture alone shalt thou feel .
Peace at night to sweeten life ,
Far from the care that fills the land ,
The world comes easy , with its cares ;
A troubled murmur ran ;
Is opening for the souls in prison !
Were there before them , and their shapes remained ,
When vengeance draws the sword in wrath .
Helpless amid the snares of death i tread ,
Shalt find acceptance , for a while suspend
That legend said rose from the lake ;
For thus the royal mandate ran ,
What could it mean ? for never before
Above the sunset , and the flowers that shake
Awake ! over vast spaces the winds are blown
Thus come into his adversaries ' hands . "
Well i remarked how he transition made ,
While thy sad thoughts are wandering with the bee ,
There is a memory stays upon old ships ,
Was centered in my little lad ,
Whence the moon its gold might borrow ;
Nature deny 'd . when all with watchful care
And flamy crocus made the mountain glow
To the third heaven her chaste soul made repair ,
Leaving it sad and forlorn .
Thy happiest moments the fates allow thee ?
But just get tempers , and when they has 'em
My apprehensions come in crowds ;
Words interwove with sighs found out their way .
Wing all our thoughts to reach the skies ,
With silveryness , the sunny pastures swathed ,
Ever made the passing wind more sweet .
Your feet shall find the scars !
As those echoing steps ring round .
But why , why flows the sudden tear ,
Spring airs are blowing sweet :
Whose white and gleaming wings beat on through space .
That , crying , met an answering cry
Take up the making share the making master gave .
Where peace sat smiling at the frowns of war .
' twill blow a gentle day . "
Her silence stabbed his conscience through and through :
Which speaks them rays of an eternal fire .
We trust -- and leave results with thee .
Adverse to these shall then in glory come ,
And make this place all paradise ;
Shaming that folly her so much had led .
When the veil of eve is drawn :
And a new life within her own she bore
A texture woven up of all delight ,
The hills of happiness to find ?
That heart that lo'ed me dearly !
Her breathing comes more subtle and more fast .
That serves a prince so great , so kind ,
And bids the gay paláśas grow :
Can set their chords or pulses thrilling .
And money for injustice paid ;
The pity at whose touch dies every sin .
Enlarged it spreads around :
No sail can reach -- no arms can win
It sang to her through the door .
If our mateship stood the test .
Things that steam can stamp and fold ;
Filling the soul of the boundless sky
Soared upward ; and a sweet light filled the sky
A blazing comet stretched from east to west
Justice must take its course .
Seeking that peace the sceptre can not call ;
Seemed hopeless hills my strength must faint to climb ,
Between them share that titheful soil ;
To look upon the murderers of this boy ,
And made it take a bath in beer .
Nor did i bear the melody throughout .
In durance held by grim magicians ,
All appetite had left his maw ,
A hero 's life may save :
Here folly dashed to earth the victor 's plume ,
Impelled by gratitute for kindness shown ,
Scarce from the chin can keep asunder ;
My king commanded , and my course i bore .
Than my true-love he built for me .
Discerned them as their leaves took flight ,
To bear in anguish , and lose in pain ,
Nor their hearts be filled with anguish ,
Seemed only to be tarred with evil --
But fiercer rose his rage ; and rearing high
The lilies pale were lying .
Ere once she can discharge one word of woe :
Break with thy sighs the silence of my sleep ,
And grappled her heart 's desire .
I follow to jerusalem --
Nor any life throughout the maze discerned ;
My wit shall serve thee as courier ,
Great britain , which the muse may penetrate .
At last had grown the crushing weight ,
Looking into myself , i find this true ,
And cries aloud , going from man to man :
As it swells on the sabbath air ,
They did n't tell , nor make a fuss ,
Never foe can follow , never traitor stand ;
But him his fiery steeds caught swift away .
Life halts within him , suddenly stupefied .
Their splendid race no more a palace holds , --
A cry impetuous from its depths was drawn , --
His knights he straightway gathers
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable , add faith ,
While the prairie grass , like rippling seas ,
That virtue 's ends from vanity can raise ,
News came that left to constance not a grace ,
To outroot thine evil genius ,
Love and joy come to you ,
Resigned the breath that came no more .
The burning wood log blazed with sudden cheer ,
And , thrilled with all that death may give ,
And love , that grows from one to all .
And his kin went mourning all the way !
The power which in forbearance lies ,
The piper 's face fell , and he cried ,
That nature yet remembers
And the spent current cease to run .
And the truth shall ever come uppermost ,
While they put the bath in order ,
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore ,
Sob after sob is trapped !
Tears that make my heart feel glad ;
They fall before they reach the goal ,
A woman to assuage me , give me light ,
A shower is passing ; i hear the thunder
Free me , and gratitude my heart will fill ;
That found the common daylight sweet ,
How bright yon rows that soared in triple tier ,
Who , feigning to adore , make thee
All hope in life that still remained ,
Alas , in thee i clearly find
His hest the imperial vánar gave :
Old christmas is come to cheer up the sad ;
Enough for me : with joy i see
Where slavery rises , and where freedom ends .
When the night came , it was laden
And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine .
Jack frost takes every breath you breathe ,
That this cup of grief may pass thee ,
That merely stood , rocking the glittering coach
Our patient fathers trifling themes laid by ,
A waistcoat to keep the enthusiast warm ! "
So the ripe hours rush away .
What secret message bring ' st thou here ?
That hides the fairy 's bridal bower ;
With its strong waves my boyhood played .
And i will show thee wherein lies the spell ,
My charms and fortune you shall share . "
The battle was restored , van fronting van
But led by the disciple of our lord ,
That serve king arthur : so shall he
The heart of boyhood in him stirs ;
The dead shall go in white .
His blazing aegis thrice apollo shook ;
Thy might gives even sin a garment beautiful ;
In yellow bars lie bare and bright
The clouds which rise with thunder , 196 .
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths ,
One moment gazed upon her piteously ,
Which would not let the common air come near ,
Complaining as it sways and plies ;
A light , which on thy troubled mind had shed
The souls of those whom anger overcame ;
You , too , to fame may rise ;
The wanderer to his resting-place drew near .
The thing designed shall surely come to pass ;
Thus the harmless hare makes answer :
No flying scorpion darting instant death ;
Unguarded and helpless , to meet his own death .
For then sweet dreams of other days arise ,
Go on , for thou hast chosen well ;
I followed — lest my heart should break .
This very day , now a year is run .
That swept the winter 's snows ?
A mark in every face i meet ,
The wind it blew in bush and tree ,
The gods approve ; rejoicing hands combine ,
Whom heaven denies the blessing to relieve ?
Whose beauty spoke the rose 's tongue
For my heart too springs up at the pressure ,
And the battle thunders o'er the plain ,
The purpose of imperial youth grew strong .
Locks loose the sea-wind scatters ,
They bore to heaven upon their joyous laughter .
And rivet them while the seasons range .
Forgotten dreams , banished visions ,
Stepping up on the rising scents of flowers ,
The gayest heart he teaches melancholy ,
Your sole defence , your guardian power is gone !
Stamped it as folly , or as fraud attacked ;
Though ovid somewhere says that rome is worthy
She whispers , melting with delight . a twig
Thy downcast eyes make answer to my plea ;
When the call came : " forward , larry ,
Where love comes never any more
The fraud designed , the purpose dark ;
The fruited shocks deride october 's chill .
Or they fell asleep where the ground was red ,
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice ,
Would give me life and soul anew ,
But pour one torrent through the ways that wind
And turned him to the fray .
Philosophy the fair , to dwell with men ,
But fill me with the old familiar juice ,
And that a debt time owes unto thy fame .
The grievous blow which falls on thee .
And a great hole was shot through my heart .
And down her slender form they spread ,
And woke the chords of joy and pain ,
Her morning 's work had hung in her mind
Far and wide the tidings travelled ,
And so the maiden , gathering courage , said :
Why let me stand with watering mouth ? --
Where your souls may lie on the holy flowers ;
The last faint echoes rang along the plains ,
The gusty south its rainy clouds may muster ;
For half the year is set aside ,
A dreadful rumor roared on every side ,
And rest were come to all .
Down went the fatal day of hector , down
Past doubt her wisdom , taking from mad war
Up to the vaulted dome like clouds it soared ,
That hovered there awhile .
What dawning light attracts the muse 's eye ? --
By you these verses may be seen !
Down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak ,
His mighty heart nigh breaking with his grief ,
By doctrines fashioned to the varying hour ;
Late pressed forth to war against their will ,
Thus by rotation like repose is gained ,
It was a spring that never came ;
The historical event which first brought the romans into familiar
Be tasted ere it work ; the last exceeding
Bringing within his claws so red
Of all flowers that breathe and shine .
But follow , love , where thou shalt guide .
That life may live !
Veiled , floating phantoms , lost in twilight space ;
Like tragic masks of stone . with weary tread ,
But the heart fluttered like a wren
And their tails like fans unfolded .
Whoop ! the doodles have broken loose ,
While down his cheeks the tears coursed fast
They still have made me slight returns ,
Their tricks and craft hae put me daft ;
Till my life is filled with darkness ,
With lovely light to cleare my cloudy grief .
Tut ! bah ! we take as another case --
To that silent isle , which lies
The faith in which my father stood ,
She held my friendship in esteem ;
With cold choked fear the thronging lives
The government bullock train toted its load .
Thus error 's monstrous shapes from earth are driven ;
Nor any breezes blow so light .
But at his voice old dreams awoke
Soon thou ' lt find thy sorrows ending .
He ranks him with those captains of reform ,
When envoys are by sound discretion led .
Aeolian for thine every breath to stir ;
The world would kill her soon : but faith
But by a power , to spirits only given ,
A spring wind rises from the north-east ;
And we show our love for the saviour ,
The sun is set , the clouds are met ,
Storm , such as drove her under moonless heavens
Their wars to prop the tarnish 'd crown ;
A wilding lost till safe it lay
The cat runs races with her tail . the dog
Hope is always springing new ,
And shifting rainbows crest the rising showers .
With evil thoughts the monsters rove ,
Love offers up his whole rich store of pain ,
Mid flame and mystic darkness rolled .
Wild electrical webs and the battle that rolls
Peace is our portion . yet a whisper rose ,
Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less .
Detain from following thy illustrious track .
The priceless pearls of truth they miss :
It answered : " thee as in my mortal frame
Calm to that fate above the moment given
The fortressed rock of silence , rent apart
And morn a new politeness took ,
Who shall declare which gift conveyed the greater heritage ?
In multiform life to united progression , --
The months and years swiftly draw to their close .
From the chimney , red eyes sparked the gloom ,
Such thousands of arrows have got ,
Shame , tearless grief , and stifling wrath ,
That sang low burthen , and of roses ,
The flag no tyrant 's power could bow !
Their thrones let alban monarchs fill ;
Maiden-lips , with love grown bolder ,
His course intended ; else how had the world
And dulling delight by exploring its cause ,
The songs that i made for thee .
The radiance came , and with it bore
It 's pride that makes the heart be great ;
The brand he laid in beowulf 's lap ;
Lost hopes and dead affection ,
Out of my song have grown
Of her to make an impious holocaust ;
A palpitating wonder hushed in awe .
An anvil forth , and reaching shoe and nail ,
“ idly , those rites imaginary tend ,
Whose splendour rushed to no eternal setting :
Her glances , and the underlids that go --
My heart it maketh such ado ;
Which gives out flame , yet it its whiteness shines
This can unlock the gates of joy ;
My hope and doubt were hard to sever .
A hawk arose from a fluff of feathers ,
Trembles , when any spirit feels itself
Find christians all ready to strengthen their hands .
' mid the dear lost scenes my boyhood knew ;
In horror from the threat that lay before ,
And guests in prouder homes shall see ,
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise ;
Breaking the silence of the seas
So melted she in tears of anguished pain ,
If he had thought the magic shield to show ,
A mind on murdered victims placed --
And turned his eyes upon the two --
A sign of union , which shall bring
Lo ! how they sunk to slavery again !
And never a moment there did stand .
He had obtained her word .
Those that die well eternal bliss shall follow .
In the great hour of destiny they stand ,
No more my soul a charm in music finds ;
The flames would leap and then expire .
For ever racked with ailments fresh
Behold , thy spirit stole upon my sight
Lest you might work any evil ,
In pearly drops the wishful waters glide ,
The day 's affairs hold .
To die is but to lose my breath .
Gives suck to as the kindly wolf gave suck ;
What wealth the show to me had brought :
In days of old when arthur filled the throne ,
With other things , the doctor brings
The truth , in which all intellect finds rest .
That polyhymnia and her sisters made
For all who pass to larger life with thee ,
When she did note how others took his eye
Let my heat to your light be reconciled .
Her sunshine hair about her bosom swirled ;
“ each mind of mutual care a portion bore ;
The wine-cup gladness lent .
Love taught my tears in sadder notes to flow .
With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war .
Though i felt almost dying to see thee . "
Follow my resigning ;
Thus hath he cast for his encress
Increased at night , until it blew a gale ;
And following her beloved lord ,
The angry clouds are gathering fast ,
Are mirrored anew where the sunlight lies .
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
But leave to heaven the measure and the choice .
And drew a thousand colors from the light ;
The princess , though her purpose would not frame ,
In thee no sorrow can be found ,
A whirlwind swept loch katrine 's breast ,
And how clean the picture comes
The crowded streets of lanká flew .
How my pulses leaped and stirred --
Soon as the vengeance of her sting is cast ,
That bore king alfred 's battle-sword
And here they stretch to the frolic chase ,
But keep your fancy free . "
So slight that virtue never could grow strong ;
Tell him england hath taken me !
The reeking shuttle lifeward wove ,
And all the platform solemn stillness holds ,
And winds make music in the thorns ;
Many enigmas there might find solution .
And his halting ditty began to tell :
Had bound him to a meaner bride ,
At length disperse this sorrow 's cloud .
Till the deep sea in silence lay
For mighty matters keep him far away . "
But it had fast to his heart strings grown ,
No wind to make a little stir .
John gave the keeper two whole sous ,
Now when their native song their hearts can move ,
There as the shadows slowly gather round ,
Thy childhood must have felt the stings
Down sliding from the topmost heaven , on earth
Against the horizon that shifts and quivers ,
And soft persuasion fills her mouth ,
Where grief detain 'd me prisoner , mounting high ,
Though gods descend from heaven 's aerial plain
Never will they tread these uplands ,
He 'd take hands round with all the three ;
Giving into her hands the right of wrong !
The many sins that stain my native home .
Whither the soul takes silence for its mate ,
The other warded off the drooping boughs .
Infusing all that fires the breast ,
And glimmering helms swept by me . sorrowful
And christ went sadly .
Takes to her heart the wood-nymph wild ,
Seemed filled with malice of some dark intent .
Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood .
Here nectar flows ; it sparkles in our sight ;
Before a breeze sprung up from east by south ;
And spread a gloom o'er every british heart ;
Storms would bring us pain and trouble ,
No light will be struck near my eyes
But no trace of disease could find .
Sinners filled with longing look up , with belief
The new moon gave but little light
If my soul was not fitted to prize it ,
In the very words which follow :
That sometimes god leaves sinners to their sin , --
And the heart -- makes haste to close .
And sought a land of liberty .
To one brief moment caught from fleeting time
Which nor atrides nor his greeks can bend ;
Wan faces smiled , and hearts felt hope ,
A stranger star that came from far
Slumbering in covert , till the shades descend ,
This their saddened song and echo :
So my soul held that moment 's heaven ; --
And buds and bells with changes mark the hours .
Bring love that knits all hearts in one ;
Both false and righteous it hath power to stay .
To italy came charles , and for amends
Deep tulips dashed with fiery dew ,
And our alliance seeks to gain ;
To go forth killing in white mercy 's name ,
Yet seemed it pierced with anguish to the height ;
Where scenes more glorious his great soul engage ,
The which my drama cares not to rehearse ,
He raised the dead to life and light ;
Has made her seat amidst my heart :
Where cruel slavery never sought to reign ,
How much that light would make him blink .
The reason he felt so much displeased
And the soft , youthful couples there may move ,
And the fret lies on me .
All the things you 've held and trusted
What sunshine hours had taught in vain
Then helymus , by his example led ,
And vanished in the sunshine . how it came
Which a man who was really a carpenter made .
Discretion lent to shew the ill from good ,
Some favouring god achilles ’ heart may move ;
After that breaking wave of pain . --
And insult he had borne so long .
For the weaver winter its shroud had spun ;
Lies hidden from the cheerful sky ,
From sleep the passions no temptations draw ,
Speechful eyes being gone away ,
With gullies twisting like a serpent 's track .
He reaches his dwelling in doubt and in dread ,
So wide the opening seemed , where bounds were set
And plaintive as the music that is made
Godfrey this while gave victory the rein ,
My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind ,
In the dim silence falling on the grey .
In the swirling dark the dark priest speaks --
The sundial writes the passing of the day ,
Alighting feels her first : the learned nine ,
That shakes the lonely woods ,
The pain and anguish that you feel .
Filled her fists with tears of longing ,
Harsh words , though pertinent , uncouth appear ;
Myself expose , with lonely steps to tread
And from the dark west a new wind arose ,
And one dead form all nature 's features bore ;
Peace the hungry man gives bread ,
So tall , he almost touch 'd the sky ;
You may note how bad the bite is
That rang for priest and king ,
As she stood by her gay friends ' side .
Of morrow-nothingness shall touch this mouth ;
All nature keeps the eternal high decree :
Her constant pity fed the poor --
Came sound as faint as echo 's own echo --
And future ages hear his growing fame .
The colors before us fly ;
Within his toils the sinner draws ,
And terror crept behind .
But now far other song came o'er
This weeping marble had not asked thy tear ,
This said , he sat ; and expectation held
And sought to unriddle the primal curse
And bottles of pickles , and clocks they threw ,
Glad earth perceives , and from her bosom pours
And all may well sigh and feel strongest emotion ,
The pomp that brings and shuts the day ,
To him , the shepherd folds his flocks .
Where pan makes music light and gay .
He introduced the work as follows :
Into my bosom and be lost in me . "
The wain goes heavily , impeded sore
His hundred 's soon hit :
The marvellous stone gave he ,
Yet cease thy flowing grief , forsaken maid !
Leave studied wit and guarded phrase
All still in the wood 's stillness stood ,
Like the long serpent that a fakir makes
Where broke the hills abruptly to their fall
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here ! --
And say aloud , lest tears should rush --
And youth and age stood mingled breast to breast .
And held the wayward fragrance of a rose
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Which holy vow he firmly kept ,
In giving faith to speech ,
Earth that held thee and skies that kissed
The stormy petrel finds a home , --
That a loving fate bestowed ,
Breaking the silence of the seas
Every stream knows thee as brother ,
That made her glad ,
When on a morning fire broke from the eaves
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink .
A hand came over the sun ,
That fills his hearers with delight ,
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
They shall yet make columbia victorious .
Touched he upstarts -- his chains unbind -
He shed a silent tear , and calmly said ,
Till light and courage fill the nation :
Thy master minstrels swept the strings ,
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
Along the flowers the bee went murmuring ;
Or doth he feel the cross
Then night is wearing late i trow --
Thus in thick orders settling wide around ,
Blown up his nose to help the ailing eye .
He seeks that moment , fatal to the world ,
Her soul went up on that lifted cloud
The conqueror 's steps he leads .
The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
The truth , assuming what i did not feel .
They passed , like shadows risen from the tombs .
So long as the hangman makes us dread
Whereon red gold and diamonds shine ;
But odin 's self stood where his image stands ,
Then swift as harpies sprang they forth ; they strained
Then let me hold the faith i held before .
Our fathers ' generations , whereat lay
A glorious word to earth is given :
But you that weld our credit should have eyes
Peeping up came gorgeous blossoms ,
Faith 's rule was ended and doubt stood supreme !
Faint echoes of her songs come drifting by ;
That little twist of brain would ring a chime
Tell him just how she sealed you , cautious ,
Of some error demanding a heartfelt contrition :
Then ráma , while his spirit burned
And burning lips , that tremble with desire ,
They found in far heart of the new
Which the thief had took to ride .
Love that endures , from life that disappears !
But ere the delighted cloud could make reply ,
And all that makes the heart grow gray ,
And how his madness went away ,
So even hung the balance of the war ,
Of days that made the friendship strong --
Begins to redden these october mornings ,
Filled up with grapes of wrath .
So fast the crests went down .
Now lay those sorrowfull complaints aside ,
Her song ascended there ,
Freshly as even the gales that come
Round whom the seraphs fold their wings .
Let others draw from smiling skies their theme ,
But i , urged blindly on by hate ,
Milky bosoms float through red hair ,
And we departing left them to that broil .
Till de new year pass along .
To this address john deep attention paid ;
And , to extend the flames of war ,
Mind , to remember , to bear in mind .
I 've found a joy in sorrow ,
Wherein you wait my coming as the twilight falls .
The faith of a martyr the tragedy showed ,
But threats and prayers majestically mix 'd .
Though the heavens in council sate
Now then command your poetry .
While those i love glide in and dwell immortal .
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
Each time through them the breezes blew ,
Slow comes the dawning in the east ;
( this metaphor is freely taken
What door shall hold , or what walls withstand
And pinks stood proud and high .
The young creation , and they hailed the sound .
_ ai n't _ you glad november 's come ?
And to pass thy days in comfort .
And thus the purpose of his gift declares :
The saxon standard waits .
Those little , shadowy paths that wind
I felt it rise invisible as fate ,
And the wretched council 's bosoms beat ,
While that celestial company came down --
Like iron that comes molten from the fire ;
Then she fell to weeping gently ,
Then rose sweet murmurings of them that pray ,
That god of nature still directs the way ,
These tears come to her : -
When passion asks what passion braves ?
He heard , and thus his answer made :
That led mine army o’er the sea .
That could in pleasantness compare with these .
That softly passed as wind through green spring ways
It drew them thro the wood --
One friend still shared the injured captive 's lot ;
And my tears ran wild .
The grace that is given by god in his mercy
With his songs he lay extended ,
Unto the weak new vigor it imparts ,
Cast away regret and rue ,
As the sun comes from the east ,
And fountains run with wine and oxymel :
Can give a bliss o'ermatching thine ,
But , looking still on her , i stand amazed
At last , scarce knowing what it meant ,
The magic car moved on .
I dare not lift to thee mine eyes --
Would urge a base retreat ;
When the snow lay round about ,
When of old they broke rounding yon spine :
And it made me fret and worry
The pale which held that lovely deer :
Which europe 's bleeding genius called abroad ,
The dull thought surges , as the driven waves fight
There comes the voice that circumvents the gale ;
The gods give those who do their will .
And keep ambition down !
That moaned as tho ' the tree 's heart broke
The social whiff went cheerly on ! --
" out of defeat escaped some scant three score
The trembling messenger of bliss !
Piteous prayer for thee shall make
The soft trade-wind is lifting
Tyrants -- who misery spread through every shore ;
A light beyond comes brushing through our eyes ,
And we 'll put our trust in him ,
The lightest pledge which binds her love and life ;
The organ plays .
Should make me so forget my courteous vein ,
Plucking the lute they sent forth lingering sounds ,
And the tears again can gather ,
Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked ,
With one wing she sweeps the heavens ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Their tree-armed legions held the ground .
Has parted for the wind these locks to blow .
To make the rich caparison his prey ,
Take flight , and thou art free to roam ,
There 's music in the rain that falls
The west wind always brings us rain ,
No help to human anguish bring , that bleeds
Majestic autumn rears her placid head ,
The front of battle ráma held :
Sigh for the heart that powerless all to save ,
When all the world shall turn to praise
And the wild car the exulting panthers bore ,
The lightning that it grasped .
Its pathway , which the wisest fail to spell ;
Fortune herself can lay no claim to it .
And the boughs held twenty-one ;
The sleep which for centuries she has been keeping .
Proud edward 's armies came ,
A mighty buffet ; dizzy swam his eyes ,
But make the absolute best of what god made .
O gentle lady ! i should draw upon you
And voice of scotland 's law was sent
But to deal death to those who seek our good
A look she cast over that dark past ,
The realms of beauty then i bound ,
Departed spirits we have loved -- and shared .
With thee , my lord , enchanted strayed
What pleasant grove is that i see . ”
The mother ’s love may yet restore again
And human fate brought tragic things to pass .
Give motion to thy wings ! depart from hence !
About thee : salt shall spread
A vague mist hanging ' round half the pages :
Gave wealth to sway the mind with double force .
No smile demeter cast : the gloom she saw ,
Time is with material filled ;
Infuriate she kicked against imperial fact ;
Rolls in the tide and the cloud waves toss ,
First made their onset , loud beneath their hoofs
So humbly ( so the humble story goes , )
Touching was bob in his joy --
Grace and shifting beauty float ;
And each day brought proof of fealty ,
And each with each took counsel meet
The virtuous ring which served the truth to explore !
With ease that loss the nation might sustain ,
And slave as i was my triumph fell .
Never on me came anguish like to this
And melts in visions of eternal day .
Of battle , had brought hatred on the gods ,
It chanced a bee did fly that way ,
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder ;
Which bears the seal of your protection ?
Alone did fare the hero / unto an island vast
Reluctant went : meanwhile achilles , plung 'd
Or won to what may work his utter loss ,
A dungeon followed next , nor did he grieve ,
Who train its mind ? who mould its wit ?
Ere yet the east assumes her faintest blush .
To the things that god has made ,
Of inspiration , thus spreads out to man .
To make folks fancy he has got a horse ;
For wonder-working faith has made it blow
When all the god came rushing on her soul .
Bearing the gifts that _ good _ angels bring ,
Who makes all nature 's chords resound
Touched with her pulsating , delicate laughter ,
What strength her weakness covered ; what abased
And love , while many a tear he shed ,
Could not stay his tears of sorrow .
The heart to seek a resting place above .
The silver veins beneath it laid ,
A panic seized the epeans when they saw
The life and death winding dizzy between ;
His merry pipe attunes the rural lay .
Laughed hard as the glad blood went and came .
Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose ,
A sorrow dares not show its face
That as i gave the earth to spread her fair
It shineth as a beacon
From death alone she seeks her last relief ;
Or be counted vulgar and set at naught .
Ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart
Main reason to persuade immediate war ,
The teter-board of life goes up ,
Where my thoughts fly back to be
The tale of our happiness told ?
Hear the steep generations , how they fall
Its every trifle makes it dear .
And see what comfort it affords our end .
And lo , his eyes were filled with tears .
What though bitter loneliness always follows after ?
For sounds of sadness came with sounds of joy .
Of borrow ( unless foresight cheat me here )
And as the wind-swept blossoms fall
That made him look very droll in the face ,
Of conflict rose around achilles slain !
Now breathed the prayer , now fed the flame :
Of nature , life and order came .
The secret purpose which i feel . }
And found that love was life
I cut my teeth and took to fun .
Where liberty shall firmly stand ,
Strong hands that knew each axe 's trust ,
Holds the promise o ' the summer --
And in the watches of the night there came
That their health does not mend , but decline :
Aware ' twill end ; your patience that can reach
The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm ,
Thy windy will to bear !
But a time came when , turning full of hate
The haze is swimming where the beeches stand ;
These moved me more than words of mine can say
Give my cold lips a kiss at last :
My heart he filled .
Seldom departs so wholly i content him . "
If others have faith in you doubly you 're bound
That makes the blood in my veins run warm :
Now to her berth the ship draws nigh ,
And with his awful nod made all olympus shake .
His happy parent 's dust down he doth lay ;
Have gone to their reward , i do not sigh
To gain their credence in his sembled grief :
" if eyes were made for seeing ,
Thence called museion , was the trial waged
Now while the dark about our loves is strewn ,
Oh soon the forest will ring with cries ,
Crying my steps when the day has gone ,
For dreams that no fruition met ,
He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove ,
But cries are hurled , and distant missiles plied ,
The prospect fills me with dismay .
Learn 'd things , that to his victory gave rise
To press their juice against the winter 's day :
Rose crimson , and deposed the stars ,
Flashed leaping silver , vines and vines and vines
Ere noon appeared assistance they secured ,
And give to god each moment as it flies !
Transferred to regions upon which the clouds
And guests in prouder homes shall see ,
With wonder and horror the action see ,
Shall give the law . with iron bolt and chain
With a holy light is beaming --
By heavenly hands their force was stayed .
And my full thanks take for it .
There a strict rule the wakeful frenchman keeps ;
And in faith they went peacefully singing ,
We called for the blood of his wife ;
Quaked with magic , quaked with awe .
The white clouds scud between .
Till he was threading through a crowd , a sea
And freedom 's fame finds wings on every wind .
But briny sorrow made me smart withal !
Still doth the file of hebrew dames proceed .
All honour gave that army brave ,
They stay their crystal fretting ,
Thy blessed eyes breed such desire ,
At poverty there that slept
Had drawn me wholly , to its burning top .
Thus , led by those chaste guides , we may
They came unto their journey 's end ,
His oath at pentecost was heard .
Of hopes that retreat , and regrets that remain ?
But ever as it glides it sings ,
Than beauty here on earth has given ;
To it a happy name is given ;
Upflashed a glare unearthly through the town ,
He saw his projects wholly marred ,
The tuscans raised a joyful cry
Two years go on that have no memory ,
The bending trees to dance invite ;
And yet there came no cooling breeze ,
Like mountains built of unconsuming flame .
Second of satan sprung , all-conquering death !
Which should speak to all who followed .
And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins
To make my body a temple pure
Behind the mist my virgin ramparts lie ,
Do here find rest .
Over toward the alps it floated ,
And first came parson rook ,
Bared by life 's ever beating brine ,
The builder bring his gothic arches .
And all that once received the early rain
Follow your saint , follow with accents sweet !
" there moved antiope , with haughty charms ,
And , god ! who can the field embrace ?
As round and round we run ;
No fault in women , to make show
Money he took , and let them smoothly off ,
Thou terrible bark , ere the night be gone ,
And meet their pity face to face ;
Mourns for the glory that hath flown .
She called for vengeance on the deed ;
But in the following canto i unfold
Made a full and prudent answer :
My hands were only lilies , only made
And all that did then attend and follow ,
And each man scratched his saxon poll ,
No sound breaks the exquisite silence but the call of
Answered in the words which follow :
We only fashion it to suit our wants ;
My soul seeks thine in its abode ;
The bonds that bound him as a noose .
In fair desire thine earth-born joy renew .
Before her looks no clouds would stay ,
The moon is tired and gives but little light ,
Could make assignable , -- and then
Spreading , when summer hither is brought ,
Were upward swept by tongues of fire ,
Help me to stem the tide of sorrow ;
Whence arose thy fangs of poison ?
And how the king ’s wrath turned to fire
Grey granite trees was music wrought .
More fierce it runs , more broad it flows ,
Think how they gain in moral freedom !
How happy it makes me to think of it ,
And pull descending vengeance from on high .
Himself to sing , and build the lofty rhyme .
Have witnessed many a lover 's vows ,
Of poppies , cut by many streams ,
But joy loved better to gaze on the sun ,
Can make the flower fade that fills my breast
And let it go on without us .
They roared , and down in showers together rushed .
And ever taking your salt to savor their tears .
And on his guide suddenly love 's face turned ,
Into the wild and wondrous world they sway ;
Till the faint air was troubled with the song
And thine eyes shone with joyous memories ;
So follows he his fate ,
Tenderly dying , touched with pain
Shall , with their freedom lost , all virtue lose
The wind blew fresh again : as it grew late
Which finds itself without a fastening still .
A strong emotion shakes my anguish 'd breast :
The covenant whereby all things are framed ,
Wide wasting wars , the scourge of innocence ;
Where eternity spreads its zone ,
So chased she , and so dashed the ranks asunder
Already his great course has run .
His soul sustained his sorrows in her sight .
Midst languid thoughts of greater bliss he lay ,
Their gates wide open threw .
Alike , when justice claimed his right ,
And caught a glimmering spark ;
All christian hearts may kindle or keep warm .
Were hid the pious and the true --
A gloomy mask that none might penetrate ,
What armaments shall follow thee in joy !
An avalanche leaped one spring-tide night ;
A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire ;
What comes of all our ' ologies .
The tall tired trees that make our sky
As flowers absorb the rays that they receive .
Flash the river , lift the palm-tree ,
Perfumed with fresh fragrance , and glittering with dew .
The dreadful darkness , shook to mounted sun ,
There 's plenty of girls to fill our places .
I give my lips to laugh and song ,
" never shall men of mine take flight ;
O , wilt thou bring me rest !
The god that died to make it knows
Which all at once against the king they rest ,
At times pass through us ,
It turned to a devil all teeth and claws ,
Now come the days gray-huddled in
Like sunlight scarcely vanished .
Yet cool of autumn waits till the wild goose screams
The blood of man shall make thee red .
The french arise . they stand assoiled and quit
And thus his ditty ran ;
Now like a sioux encampment stood ;
There lay an old wyfe in that place ,
The sun to rest in splendour sinks ,
The worm its golden woof presents ;
All gave consent , and forth there rose no lack
Then came the dramatis personae ;
By feeling more or less the eternal breath .
At every trifle scorn to take offence ,
Of life long since has anchored by thy side .
As an assembled universe may see .
Slow he gave way , the rest tumultuous fled ;
War shall claim command of all ,
Through these th ' excited horses held their way .
And war shall lay his pomp away ; --
Time 's bitter flood will rise ,
Never can the hero give it ,
Until the autumn fell ,
Love 's darts in may are flying .
Of all that it contains . the following heaven ,
Two crimson rose leaves made his mouth ,
A charm as fatal as the first it wore ,
Refused to show , though gave no reason why .
The morning came , the chaise was brought ,
An ' a country 's confidence washed away
Thy brother too her fate shall share .
" time will fly on equal pinions
And every tint that trees assume ,
Then she drew into the sunlight ,
Amidst this wreck , where thou hast made a shrine
Raised his eyes to god , and died .
P athetic strains and passionate they wove ,
At least some knowledge he should gain ,
Clearer and finer the world shall arise .
What fraud might dictate , or what force compel .
And the marvelous notes they sink and swell ,
But morn is up and a fresh warfare stirs
So turn our hearts , as on we rove ,
Which deemed thy glowing face grown pale .
Which the nine muses hold in empery ,
Making thee equal to thy destiny .
Who stood before me , lost in pained surprise .
Or to what greater need these forces keep ? "
We lay our hopes upon thy shrine
Instinct with fire and nitre , hurried him
And the tears come softly stealing
The cautious chief his ready story told .
To him who sees time spin the years around .
Oh ! if your tears are given to care ,
And in each pause the story made
Or message , conveyed from the world of light ,
That sever 'd rages , and for union glows :
And arches widen , and long aisles extend .
And shadowy cross was cast
Ay , so the paper says .
Where indian wigwams now do stand
That drifted o'er the hill ,
Waxed cold , and some deal shook the cavalier ;
Where do those strong young feet now stand ?
Of life eternal , time has made thee one
_ chorus . _ by what snare taken ?
Star-loved , it breathes at the midnight hour
" rebellion proudly stalk 'd from shore to shore ,
And try what social rites a savage lends :
For as she makes one knight from strife retire ,
And all the house the uproar fills .
I trail my fingers along the alps
Into outward darkness tends !
How your defaults by false excuse you cover !
In vain the lips pour forth harmonious sounds ;
Their travels telling , whoor they 'd been ,
Though summer kills the flowers , it leaves
Thus following , hector still the hindmost slew .
Of her by whom the work was wrought : --
To keep the law and merit win ,
Following on births , he plants his feet at last
And by degrees from underneath it came
Still another sect divided
But make the absolute best of what god made .
And that a proper will i call .
The evil can not brook delay ,
To be achieved and put aside . be fair ,
For following that trade so base and vile ;
Among my tutors would attend my youth ,
Awake , arise ! the hope we bear
His army contracts riches yield ;
And oft was moved to flee from home
Texture o'er her sad lips is closely drawn
The stream reflects each curve on shore ,
Trampling , with heel that will not spare ,
Two thousand years had passed since christ was born ,
Depending fell the cord . shouts rent the skies .
When euryclea from the queen descends ,
And every shore it circles thine !
Thy thoughts should run on mirth and fun , --
Were my nerves relax 'd and low ?
But hers to whom we glide .
All ties dissolved and every sin forgiven ,
Parts it may ravage , but preserves the whole .
Gun after gun fell silent , as the night
To avert the flower of life 's decline . "
Which made all music one :
And his fierce breast with fury glowed .
And through the wind-touched reddening woods shall rise
The charms i admit she possesses . to me
‘ your honour shall see before i go ;
Hadst thou but felt desire of noble things ,
And before they could give their battle shout ,
Where chilling winds return the winter past ,
I will grieve and hold my tongue .
' just now we 're running byes ,
Soft little hands that stray and clutch ,
The graver prude sinks downward to a gnome ,
Which had given me such content .
And i marked my love by candlelight
One purchase not denied .
In safety lead them , where the other crag
Thus shall one stroke the glory lost regain . "
Then relate what has befallen
The shrieks from ten thousand more arise ;
He simulates the hug _ he _ gave ,
To fall asleep ? a little while to sleep
Why make of tom a dullard ,
Thus to blunt the spears of wizards ,
Warring with fond regrets , that silent mourn
To tumble into sorrow and regreet ,
The light of joy that shone before .
Then rose from earth to sky a withering shriek ,
Give honor to their memories who left the pleasant strand
And mangled bore away the sinewy part .
Still typing truth , and shaped with sacred art ,
Their fainted courage , and dispel 'd their fears .
The fresh meadow blooms hung in beauty and redness ;
No glass can reach ; from infinite to thee ,
Of flashing susurration , dashed and swirled
To rove through erudition 's bowers ,
That britain gave , before her days of shame .
Youth and joy ; so jove hath sworn .
" each heart-wish from thy goodness won ,
Hills crowned with age ,
And joy on every heart be shed
How soon my lucy 's race was run !
The wrecks still left to show .
Rather new suns across the sky shall pass ,
No language tells the torture or the pain ,
To make a seizure on the light ,
Till it pierced the clouds in growing
And climbed the steeps of heaven , scattering round
The bow rang out , the arrow sped !
Winter on every hand i find :
That i might see the cheerful , peeping day .
Down came , by accident , a chandelier ;
With terror rose and disappeared ;
His homeward way he took ;
That providence , which here distributeth
Arranged a country dance , and flew through light
From hence proceed aversion , strife ,
A mineral spring to refine the metropolis .
Comes deliciously nigh to the splendors of heaven !
My pen i have laid down in sorrow ,
By mary 's hand at eve was spread .
On which the eye delights to rest , --
Thy absence from my sight , but to avoid
Have lighted up and led his age ,
That is a tribe no goodwill ever shews .
To make us feel existence , and to shew
The snow-white clouds he northward chased
Nor was it a thorn that could rend :
Their dress and courtly manners see --
Who died to make peace sure and life secure ,
So the first kiss , when once given ,
I have lost pace with the winds .
When his fierce eyes with fury burn ,
That which before us lies in daily life ,
One drop of honey gives satiety ;
That went to help the sea .
To keep that tryst with me ? "
Which made him burst through honour 's laws
Now overhead a rainbow , bursting through
Since they followed as crusaders
Is where alone our souls can rest .
They with parched lips their pangs must bear ,
There passed a weary time . each throat
Each at the mercy seat their love renewed ,
Good cheer ! your greeting hailed more than me ,
Skulking , but standing boldly for the wives ,
To a yet higher rapture ere it sink .
And the ceiling fair that rose aboon
And painful sweat from all his members flows .
Which wove a silver iris ' round her form .
Through the fens he went rejoicing ,
And the nails downward with them dragged the scab ,
And smoke drifts up across the eastern sky
As a lover 's whose tired arm slips
The silence deepened ; and i tried to speak
Pale golden feathers drift across the sky ,
On his greeting , follows sickness ,
John now of his new dignities felt proud ,
In his mind was thus reflecting :
Had risen to do honour to the pair :
He twirls my kite till it breaks its string .
While loudly were blending the trumpets ' glad sound ,
Their pathos cut him to the quick ,
When time hath taken _ this _ headache away .
The clouds of lead flowed overhead ;
As fast revolving years proceed .
The souls most fed with shakespeare 's flame
The mournful story to unfold
Was greedier ever as the seasons came ;
To tread the downward , melancholy way ?
The pain it should have felt before !
In bitter broken words confessed his shame ,
That holds the heart hopes of humanity .
For real shades to issue from the dead .
While happiness pursued was never caught .
There will your mind be drilled and braced ,
Thereby , in heat of anger , to address
Nor dare disclose his anguish .
And , should affairs go on as pleasant
Her gaze went out as long ago ,
To swear a truce ; where paris in the midst
As flashing as moses felt
But all that careful malice could design
When buds of promise never came to leaf ;
Upon my way to sleep before it fell ,
Shall fill all the earth with my fame . "
The chart of knowledge , pointing where it lies ;
Storm-wind makes and storm-wind follows !
Let thy sweet muse the rural faith sustain ;
" the sea shall carry my dreams far away ,
Who shine in kingdom come ,
The brandished sword of god before them blazed ,
Viper-broth might give him vigor .
Still closer knit in friendship 's ties ,
And still found the false with the true ;
Your fear itself of death removes the fear .
Death 's ceaseless dance goes on .
That spreads a smile o'er hill and plain !
These broken , flying threads like thee and me ,
Horizons that stretch back afar .
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn ;
Which speaks the hour of dinner ;
Your luxury might break all bounds
Driven by a mighty tempest .
Below once lay a cellar ,
As if striving to bring forth another sea .
New life returned to him .
And all my love was so absorbed in him ,
Strong as the tempest when it holds its breath ,
The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine
Thy wreck a glory -- and thy ruin graced
Into the wells what heat it bears itself .
Before her gazes the earth in beauty lies ;
Passed in wise contemplation , prayer , and praise .
Which tyranny flung round us then ,
Th ' impending woe sat heavy on his breast .
And bade his willows learn the moving song .
Of borrow ( unless foresight cheat me here )
Your chariot will melt to mist .
Through lonely woods that round them lay
Nature gave laws drawn from my noble strain ,
Creator ! something yet of doubt remains ,
And love lights the waves as they run .
" love , and a song to follow ,
I heard a promise gently fall ,
That have made of ak-hissar
We do not ask a longer term of strife ,
And with me i see how she stands
The which now having taught , i will go on
A voice like spring is calling : let us go
How fast the scenes come flocking to
Is slowly strangled by remorseless pain :
But i saw his blue eyes looking elsewhere ,
Was by the madman 's furious stroke laid low .
It 's a song that soars and sings ,
The idea danced before us as a flag ;
Thine armies ten long years ere victory came ,
Whose own example strengthens all his laws ;
Fair economy 's rules he brings to his view ,
And martial music cleaves the sky .
With loving arms stretched meward ,
While life shall last me . ” so they went
In vain my reason tried to cross the bar ,
He spake with the primeval race .
When the darkling night has gone ,
To reap the gladness you had sown
Joined with me once , now misery hath joined
Allowed that flynn was a fearless man .
And little danger found , though much he sought ,
The candles on the altar blazed ,
Tears had his sad eyes been shedding .
The wind stood up and gave a shout ;
Of those same fragrant exhalations bred ,
And midway its leap his heart stood still
And bliss had " gone to glory . "
Venus , it seems , has sought to lead astray
Giving their anguish utterance : as when
Shall fix its base ; my native king alone
To it no stain of sin now cleaves --
Worn out with play ; the tangled weeds lie still
Are chatting , and making remarks on the weather ;
Our targets steam to meet thy wrath ,
Life and death he drew as circles ,
Reechoing thy heavenly harmonie .
And their choice spirit found its calm recess
But dares destruction eate these candid breasts ,
As her own lips might tell it . now remains
And fortune threw many a thorn in his way ,
Until that kingdom come , that grand communion ,
Quickly to the banquet come ,
That art which faileth never .
A tender glamour about them wove ;
That keeps unjarred the blissful chime
Where bharadvája ’s dwelling lay ,
Rich brown gravy round it roll ,
He 's drawn in crystal lines of milk .
A shaft of fire that falls like dew ,
Till hard upon the cry of " breakers " came
And heard the swagger as it rose .
That it resembled thunderings following fast :
The incense will go sighing ,
It will last till men weary of pleasure
If thus the burdened heart may find relief ;
The summer leaves that bowed before the reaper death .
Drive the quaker coward ! '
They felt the freshness of its growing green ,
What though the stately tapestry met the eyes ,
To seek a dwelling-place in asia ,
A whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side
We 've seen the seasons through ,
To feel it biting at my heart ,
There lute and lyre sweet music played .
The melody of waters filled
But the old dame made him answer :
But the wild rose showed her little thorns ,
Nor helped nor hardened in thy growth ,
Decrepit winter , from the south to bring
Three small frozen figures hung stiff and forlorn
To war and arms i fly .
His scythe of fire had swept the plain !
His face was very white , his mouth fixed .
It came like ancient story
And to thy conduct my concerns in war . "
Their indignation knew no bounds .
The guests are met , the feast is set :
Lightly arose the prince to meet his doom ,
" thou canst not think to join in paradise
Bound to live and bound to love
Of dreams that form its aspect ; and with these
Trembles , when any spirit feels itself
In vain , alas ! her hope is fed ;
That not without a power which comes from heaven
I feel life stir within me , and my blood
And sealed the furnace ere his blood was gone .
As made my childish days rejoice ! _
Is peace with honour born ,
Is not all the life god fashions or reveals :
Silver breathes the breath of sorrow . "
May not remember , much less tell the sound .
Sad memory , with thy songs to interfuse ?
That out of evil still a good could call ,
And whose benignant hand withdraws the gloom ,
Whose ancestry had circled half the globe ,
Again i turn to that poor lonely shed
That once cleared ships from board to board .
So it skipped off in a trice ,
And hold communion with the things about me .
Who the blest gospel 's peaceful page explore ,
But thou , the counsel heaven suggests , attend !
More lived to set both slave and tyrant free ?
But the heart lies still and tame
Immortal life , your fame shall ever live ,
On dead volcanoes only lies the snow .
His baby tears dropped with her mournful prayer .
If we lead a life of pleasure ,
Detect in speech and look the sin
A touch of her lips it ravishes quite :
To accept the challenge which the herald bore ;
The clock showed the hour and the minute ,
Now , nearer earth they sail a lower sky ,
Then heathen armies stood amazed ,
The enchanted splendor , flashing far and wide ,
And make the nations merciful ,
And rained her ardent kisses on his face .
The stream obeyed . that name he bore
Ye let poor mortals go astray ,
So late and long the shadows lie
And giveth happiness or peace ,
To take my shadowgraph to hell ,
As if some earthquake hill and mountain tore ,
There rolled a sinister smoke ; --
And well it is with guilt some shame remains .
And wherever they lead us the fiend will pursue .
Gives this answer to her suitor :
Can make the sage forget his care ,
Her eyes fixed where had been some star .
It makes me furious , such things beholding :
That summer ! how it built us there
The very she called forth by ripened blood
As if god 's hushing finger grazed him ,
To cut ; its root-thrills came
And crimson leaf when summer is spent :
From age to age shall go ,
Filling all our hearts with sorrow .
Nor can i miss the way , so strongly drawn
To sanctity , that shall receive no stain :
When summer 's breath their masked buds discloses :
The frolick wind that breathes the spring ,
The spell-bound ships stand as at gaze
Therefore , o spirit ! fearlessly bear on :
And her face it wore just such a smile
And dirty in a corner long it lay ,
Can pierce the war clouds , rolling dun ,
What amis felt for amile . )
Where the friends we love are laid ,
Birds had already raised its dirge .
In its dead loveliness holds scents of old .
Here will thy nail discover where to rage ,
The falling blow would also cleave my head :
And give god thanks for love and thee !
The day had grown so hot --
Travels from north till day has waned ,
The quaint relief of mirth that plays
The heart and conscience both alike bedeck
And made him soon withdraw his fangs .
And the clouds that gather the grey skies in
Are cyprus merchants making trade to france --
The nations shall take note . his unripe age
And earthy holes the blind beasts curl and creep .
To make of what i said another thing
To keep our love aglow ,
When the clock struck the hour for retiring ;
On every hand lay heaps of youths .
I leave your own good judgment to reply . "
No usual words can bear the woe i feel ,
Would rise above the world of body , brain ,
His breath that died in hollow gusts away ,
Then the morning stars shall sing .
The love that i shall never give to thee .
Trembles , when any spirit feels itself
I feel a blessed warmth , i see
Where clear , cool waters lie ,
Silent sat the wafted lovers ,
A holy shrine that makes no pact with sin ,
When the forest cast the leaf ,
And share the wrath you may not quell .
And make new light upon the mountains .
Can close the book
Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay .
Binding the city , and a moat
But that the news to others were conveyed ;
Sorrow and shame old karl shall share ,
The spiral music that the locusts beat ,
" ere winter comes with icy chain ,
Of hundred oarsmen , beats the watery lea .
A newsboy with cold hands thrust in his pockets
Which in life gives only sorrow .
And such pure kindness unto me was shown
The road not taken . [ robert frost ]
Other traditions of high interest are connected with this ancient
' neath southern noons all quivering with heat ,
His springing tears within their fountains stayed ,
And rained her ardent kisses on his face .
But half can tell love 's feeling ;
I came as one whose thoughts half linger ,
Up he flew , but his song , remaining ,
Presently came the night ,
As braced the valour of france , who knows
A look of such sunny-omen gave
For the knight 's body stood up in its place
Lay the burning sunset of italy 's skies ;
And there that morning came the hunt ,
To combine love , song , wine ,
The afternoon , all glow and glimmer , came .
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell .
And i the lily lose .
Spirit with spirit fused , and soul with soul ,
Is this intelligence convey 'd ;
Then darkness hid them with a rainy scud ,
From a sweet instrument a sound that grew
But there comes a night when he sees lights glowing
The chance is cast upon a dee ;
And sailed my spirit surging , light and clear
Ere the time be come for taking you .
That fell from the priest 's lifted hand .
To drive the cold winter away .
Of pity for the weak his strength holds thrall ,
And unto us those holy lights gave need ,
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given ,
Till god released her of her pain ;
And with his looks made all his monsters tremble ,
For sorrow dulls their heavy sunken eyes ,
Softly on my soul that fell ;
Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe ;
How fearful were these signs displayed
The cruel torment of his thought was muffled ,
Spared in the former war , still dense it rose
Dat good rain gives mō ' rest .
My eyes were fixed upon a lovelier life ,
When his own affairs have gone ill ;
By the holy love he beareth ;
For those brief days he spent in loving me .
Swearing , unless i took all patiently ,
Must miss what other men count being ,
Saint michael 's chapel cuts the sky .
Fearless she had tracked his feet
Of such commotion ; such as , to set forth
Great hector view ’d him with a sad survey ,
Rather let tangled curls attract your view ;
Calm lay the flood around while fleet
May bound not even in thought the height and girth
High latitudes of thought gave breath to him ;
Which a man who was really a carpenter made .
My heart would open the door , musette !
Are the sole gems in neptune 's bosom laid :
And smooth the path of my decay .
Who scarce had plucked his flickering life again
And we departing left them to that broil .
Ambition led , and genius joined the chase .
His bands , o goddess ! calling to his aid
And from the clouds oft gory drops were shed .
And with bold threats they made their hatred known ,
That silence never may return again .
In love inconstant as the changing wind !
And love and glory guide the prow by turns .
And finds too late that men betray , --
That drew his weary face did softer grow ,
Barter 'd by me for what your london gives .
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead ,
And covered up nice , you see .
Wherein they exulted once . there comes no pain
Short respite ; it is all that war allows .
By faint music guided , ranging
A whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side
And show what good men are .
Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out ,
That shook the garden tree .
Content and love brings peace and joy --
Lovers , when they lose their breath ,
Heaps fall on heaps : the slaughter hector leads ,
A compass , he the upper way explored .
Their shoots in spring fill the valleys and hills .
His faith confirmed and his trust renewed
That every rock might hold upon its shelf
Tho ' certain aim and art direct them .
Their sight , made blind by urgency of blood ,
The path that her feet should tread through life --
Ere birth 's releasing hell was reached ?
Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness .
Shall ever stand in this free land
To whom the world most richly gave : forlorn
The which now having taught , i will go on
Raised the weak head and stayed the parting sigh ,
Of the landscape makes a part ;
Which made me look a thousand ways ,
Each state feels envy for the state below ;
We sighed and sank in each other 's arms .
With hands and feet i fierce resistance made ,
With sorrow dimmed and deform 'd it were ,
And the foal at once he harnessed ,
Then sharp and passionate came the cry ,
These vapours gathered to one shining hope ,
Maiden , that read ' st this simple rhyme ,
My son , there comes to each an hour
The mourners followed after ,
Like billows when ebbing it went .
With dying rage his forehead beats the ground ;
Into earth she sank like snow ;
He drew not nigh unheard , the angel bright ,
Then thus the chief his dying accents drew :
I 'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul ,
And to-morrow comes ash-wednesday ,
Then she spoke the words which follow :
Sometimes she fell asleep , she stitched so hard ,
Is it the wind that moaneth bleak ?
The subjects lay all in the prophecy line ; --
Shall scatter the darkness fell .
" there passed a weary time . each throat
The tear forgot as soon as shed ,
With the blue skies stretched above her !
And wrecked herself -- it makes me sorrowful .
With melancholy words addressed :
Floated her hair or seemed to float in rest .
The long day passes with its load of sorrow :
Love love most when love has flown .
Erelong the winter gales shall blow ,
The snows will wrap you round ;
Pure -- as her young example taught :
You can give a bad name to a dog ,
Awake ! arise ! cast off thy drowsy dreams !
The wound that took a month to drain --
They push o'er corpses , ever newer crowds ,
Take due refreshment , and the watch attend .
Or ever death has given him power of flight ,
For that thy vestments are declaring . ”
At last the candles sputtered out ,
And years have passed in seeming glee ,
Who casts to write a living line , must sweat
Where the wings of life may spread
Her fear the dread of life that turns to hide
At earliest peep of dawn bids carry forth
And sorrow comes with waking !
The rivers of his heart ran all to waste ;
Their gifts will they bestow .
Shifted to make new beauty with the hours ,
He wha could brawlie ward their bellum --
This house holds sacred in her ample wall !
Let her take a jolly pleaseman ,
Even he might turn in wrath sublime ,
How else may man make straight his plan
As boundless ocean every stream receives ,
And all you thought and felt
Pope took the idea from boileau :
My heart shot into the breast of the bird .
Unnamed be he from whom creation came ;
How many springs have passed since then ?
Some kill their love when they are young ,
That brings immediate dying : yet quails not
Those swords gave servitude to every age
And midnight rancour grasps the cruel steel ;
To gain the subject of my moan ;
And there came to the wondering mind of him
Beneath a cypress-tree , the daggers threw .
Only my plague thus far i count my gain ,
The bubbles , where they launched the boat ,
And nail your colors to the mast
And all his pupils , led astray ,
And so on him death 's black destruction came
An ' hey for the blessings ' twill bring ?
Sorrow for ráma swells the tide ,
Their scent survives their close :
And lighted the gloom
When all things round thee sweetly smile ,
Since he avowed that any fruit they bore
And all the joy one spirit showed ,
God made a little hole to put satan in .
Towards the west i turn my weary spirit ,
The waking world i share with you ;
So into it he breathed a song ,
There lies no new path over sea ,
When visited by thought ( thought will intrude ) ,
And as a man the hero acts and feels .
The innocent word that sets remembrance trembling ,
Who saw too much to make of this worn life
Win thy forgiveness also , and restore
Love now no fire hath left him ,
Which sang and shouted , alleluia ! reign
The abbess hath her promise given ,
The beatings of thy heart , as if it lay
This frosty , bracing air ?
The slender thread on which my song is strung
As day tells hours . by thy clear sun
For heathen heart that puts her trust
Content so i but shared his twilight there .
They ran from cradle to cradle till at last
Beyond all measure ! his full faith was spent ,
There , where reply to innocence is made .
That my life 's ache came so .
Of what some unborn year may show ;
Their bodies , bathed in purple blood ,
Take grief for their interpreter .
The pine-woods bring the sunset near .
Has the hostess filled with wisdom ,
Shall have its altar ; and the world shall go
Or made the poor captive 's distress 'd habitation :
What would i not , to give thee pleasure ?
Her shadow fell upon his breast , and charm 'd
It came , -- to tell me everything
Summoned the warriors who had risen for rome ,
But he has found no feud will happen ;
Pierces the bones gnawed fleshless by despair ,
Answered in the words that follow :
And the war goes on apace ,
And make a nightmare of the solitude .
They raise a weak and melancholy wail ,
When ilion 's pious traitor put to sea ;
And breaking in my prison , set me free .
Out of all lives that thought hears breathe
At last they drew them , and the foremost taken
But that does not make sorrow cease ;
Longed her dire purpose to unfold ,
There came enchantment with the shifting wind ,
And tenderest memories are pierced with pain .
Tho ' dollars shrink to dimes .
The instant made eternity --
An urn might bear , they father time .
The leaves of memory seemed to make
We yet may pick up some minute lost hope ;
With look that made me shudder .
I have made my throne ;
She crown 'd with olive green , came softly sliding
And sure enough the chime went so , --
Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast ,
The gold that lured the king was quite the same
New aspirations rise .
With their dilated nostrils spread ,
They thought the tide of grief would flow
First find your bees a settled sure abode ,
Then silent the mourners mourning go ,
Each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe ;
Where sinners hugged their spectre of repose .
And fresh-blown roses wash 'd in dew
So truth lent many a ray ,
Over the flame that plays
That tell how the noble thorold hath sent ,
Through endless cycles bite the earth like beef ,
No sound broke the charmed air . the autumn moon
Forever adrift down the years that are flown ?
I saw a soul beside the clay it wore ,
Where envy finds not blemish to amend .
The rose 's fair luxuriance sung ;
He who made your voices tuneful
Our feet are led where the millions tread ,
At the sermon was seen .
My passion 's bonds , and set me free ;
Careless of what gossips say ,
Her curious square , embossed with swelling gold ,
White and awful the moonlight reached
For shadows gather round , and should we part ,
That oft the winter fills .
And with what justice doth thy power distribute !
And shoot red flames beneath the evening sun .
O whence , then , comes the blow
Just then the sunlight fell with sudden flame :
'till tyranny their charms defaced :
For in true happiness their lives were spent .
And lively cheer , of vigour born ;
Down the glittering strings that her fingers kissed .
But it can not bring the old cheer
Therefore , my system , which includes the best
And the apple-tree shadows travel along .
So the warriors were prepared for battle ,
Slow passed another very trying year ,
To lift my voice and call him --
The mighty obligation which he bore ;
A moment stayed the fairy there :
And how their fortunes could be made . }
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears ,
All courage lost . descending from the tower
The haunt it hallows .
Hearts are braced from sea to sea ,
Victory and praise in its own right belong .
To ' scape the death that separation brings !
“ mindless to ask for years of constant youth .
To the light that holds the days ;
Across sugríva ’s eyes he drew ;
That dripped with autumn , -- for november lay
Waste as they wasted in the darker years
But these may gales blow warm and glad ,
The stones and sparks around them throw ,
To run their course , and reach their goal ,
Yet this was all the answer that i found --
Thy reassuring smile restored belief .
Her arms untired the ponderous axe can wield .
And some folks reckoned " patience , too ,
More precious made by her incestuous loves ,
Sublime on chaos borne , the goddess stood ,
And all my plants i save from nightly ill
Over the faded , pale frescoes that stand
When love went to the ending that was his ;
Who 's plodding on through life ,
With slanting rays of burnished gold ,
Once more the voice to humbled jonah came
But when he saw that life was fled ,
And warn the greeks the wiser choice to make ;
All day the clouds hung ashen with the cold ;
Dearest of thousands , now the time draws near
Feeling the unseen presence of a fiend .
The sun came radiant down the west ,
The courage of the soul must gleam in conflict
Until diminished by the reign of night .
The registry and label rested safe ;
And her dread diary with horror fills .
He comes in the light of salvation revealed ;
His glory still shines in their eyes ;
On earthly bliss ; it breaks at every breeze .
And the white lilies bow their slender stalks ,
It led , from all this strife for millions ,
The low soft voice of earth , drawing him down
From out its orient tabernacle drawn ,
Yet his heart gave a curious thump as he lay
Around her as the bright drops ran ,
But one high soldier from his promise broke :
The listening winds received this song .
Her young the partridge led .
Can lead thee into realms of joy and peace .
Greener leaves than yours are lost in every spring
May find with them the way to thee ! "
About the boughs an airy nation flew
As chimney-sweepers , come to dust .
In their beloved vessel as it roll 'd
Give to their minds a curved emptiness
Vibhishaṇ to my presence bring ,
Should stay my fix 'd career . '
Greece on the shore shall raise a monument ;
A thousand gay creations brought
Fortune hath made his virtue good ,
His body into prison lay ,
And the weakest still goes to the wall .
That dares to work our hero harm ?
When march winds brought vague rumours of the spring ,
Such lovely grace resolve itself in dust ?
And gathering clouds its dismal forests veiled ;
Answered in the words which follow :
Ready and well prepared for the career ,
Which only passing years can trace .
But the reckless living has left its stamp
We ground the dust of death .
Bugles blew by land and sea ,
And in his heart there dawned a wondrous face
Beside his bed , and many a thought was stirred
The vale with loud applauses rang ,
A garland of beauty when youth is fled !
How sweet to mark the pouting vine ,
Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee ,
And was called upon to interpret .
When late in summer the streams run yellow ,
That rest or intermission none i find .
Again can make me love thee .
And shaken voice , the suitor re-appeared ,
Before her ran an influence fleet ,
It will keep you busy both day and night ;
But i found each plan vain ,
What steps were those , as the twilight fell ?
Whence twenty thousand chariots rush to war ,
His hand , that shuts the flowers to sleep ,
Scaring fear till fear escapes ,
Away with doubts , all scruples hence remove !
Bitter for remembrance of the healing which has passed .
And ere the early bedtime came
No charge of folly can be laid .
And a hasty message they managed to send
Shall to the virtuous and the wise be given --
That makes you seem less noble than yourself ,
And storm the town . some mischief lies behind .
Thine be this charge i lay upon thee : see
Hast thou found place at the great knees and feet
New sports i hold in scorn .
Slowly and sad he winds his melancholy wave !
Two streams of tears were from his eyes derived :
Her face upturned to catch his radiant smile ;
Midst jokes that flowed full greasily ,
When the wide bloom , on earth that lies ,
He gave his counsel to the wind ,
The battle lost , no help nor hope remained ;
And every tender thought reveal 'd ,
Of war , that , in its torrent , took
That 's an easy life they lead .
Freedom a free-born nation still shall cherish ,
We dropped the seed o'er hill and plain
Till the windows speak and tremble ,
With all that makes up woman 's excellence ;
Or patiently adjust , amend , and heal ?
Each day in kindly service , given
A rushing presence rapt him as he pray 'd ;
That wrought the deed of shame ?
To quench their thirst
For trembling seized on all for that grim sight --
And left behind a smile which cheered
Blithe concord 's social form to gain ;
The funeral offering met her eye .
His pleasure lay in hounds and horses ,
Backward her sad little face went
Are in the vision of one moment caught ,
And our eyes will rest on their foreheads fair ,
The little fate bestows they share as soon ;
And out we 'll sail where the treasures lie .
In pristine beauty , bursting from the clay ,
Death comes , and all thy fancied bliss destroys ,
And turn her songs of peace to groans .
Till came thy summons to the court above .
I should feel overjoyed if you
By many ocean-sunsets tinged and fired ,
And the apes in the trees came the whine :
As if from hell this horned host he drew ,
Along the desolate shore . the die was cast .
Stately , strong he went ,
To show the splendid state in which you live .
And pitying breezes echoed sigh for sigh .
So his good horse forth at his bidding ran ,
The tear that sprang of joy and woe .
Which came last night
The heart i sent it seeking .
And frightened waves rush wildly back
Against the goddess these complaints he made ,
And carries into chaos everything
Where still she fixt her dying gaze ,
Hath carried by degrees mortality
In the great hour of destiny they stand ,
His frame by strong convulsion torn ,
Wherefrom i bring the whole of my transgression ,
His noble life jatáyus gave :
Whom nature hath made apt for every change !
Complied to take the balmy gifts of rest :
In bright mosaics wrought and set
But fair for the eye to rest upon .
The sole affection she of right can claim --
Of the cold morrow , from the emptied sky .
Yet wreaths are on the altar laid --
To make my heart forget a time its sadness .
Transfixed his soul , and kindled amorous flames ,
Not so do we count our years ;
That thrills the soul to rapture ,
A thousand years had thus flown by
The soul , with nobler resolutions decked ,
Then catch the moments as they fly ,
You talk of wondrous things you see ,
Against whose heart my throbbing heart i 'd lay
But wave after wave through the glory has passed ,
Or bow more gracefully to iron hand of fate !
They saw not in themselves aught to condemn :
Sly reynard 's wits to lay a plot ;
For ah ! there comes a fear ,
That bids our liberty expire .
As " blessings brighten when taking flight ; "
Glimpses of days gone by --
The still june midnight close about them lay :
A gracious pardon ere we meet the grave ;
And wave on wave is ever pressing ,
To council calls the peers : the peers obey .
The passion that they show me burns so high ;
And none carried further the jesuit virtue ,
Then silence , packed with murder and the press
The sails at noon left off their tune ,
Where marvellous thoughts from god came sweeping down .
Almost as airy as the line it threw ,
Whom he catcheth unaware , --
With nectar 'd drops the sickening sense restored .
My native language spoke in friendly tone ,
On the sombre rafters , that round him made
Then once again the solemn whisper came :
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;
Their rebel senses well controlled .
A change when fortune either comes or goes ;
All her trembling petals shed ,
And when the time of departure came ,
And in did come the strangest figure .
Of perfume shall fling up into the air ,
Till they have gathered the new melody .
What once breathed life and harmony !
The end is won , your fortune 's made ,
Vice thus abused , demands a nation 's care ;
The baron now his diamonds pours apace !
And gives to passion what to greece he owes .
All with orient splendour shining ,
Has felt the worst severity of fate :
When britain was laid waste with sword and flame ,
She must perceive what blame upon his head
I tensely draw , will be my last .
When summer sends the beating shower :
A shrill , faint laughter from nowhere came ...
Wings that wave , and angel glory nigh ,
Could not see your heart of passion ,
Shall reason only teach to weep ?
Then shrank , with that fear that comes alway
Thy early smile has stayed my walk ;
Death comes to reaping
Raised reverent hands and made reply :
A year has gone , as the tortoise goes ,
They are binding up their hearts away from breaking ,
Infinite , too , because it reached the sky ,
Wailed , and big tears began to fall .
Achilles felt , breaking the ranks , to rush
A desert road which no sands have swept ,
The youthful blooming nelly lay ,
Soon as they find they can not pay ;
My soul takes wing to meet the heavenly strain ;
Forth goes the mother , of the omen glad ,
The greater blessedness preserves the more .
The news was flashed to england 's king ,
The light that glittered from the world he sought ,
Turn your eyes inward , on yourself reflect ,
For nought but what thy happiness could spare .
And he that sent it , felt the pain ,
Of grief endured , or of true pleasure sought ,
And make a nightmare of the solitude .
Where tall green sedges spread their leaves ,
“ nor now relate the order of the change
Calm thoughts that inward strength afford ;
Then wild uproar and clamour mount the sky ,
All the gods bring gifts of joy ,
Till , by the foot , achilles cast him far
Of sullen winds , and feel the whir
Hast led me on by th ' fascinating light
Without a pang too sweet for me to bear !
Which in this world the litanies assume .
The pain i had felt in her tragic part .
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
And lore unfeminine , reserved for those
And on immortal eos trembling came .
That never coronal of triumph wore ,
And feel those christians fit to join in lays
That my soul it keepeth apart .
They seized with rage the foe abhorred ,
For such crimes arraigned she stood ,
Into defeat you must plunge and grope --
“ with equal swiftness follow 'd . now to grasp
Then , bending mute in dreams of painful bliss ,
Shalt feel the pangs that kill me now .
The saddest tears must fall , must fall ,
And sorrow that succeeded .
He 'd give consent they should wed together .
But glory remains when their lights fade away .
The glowing future lies unrolled ;
Its scorn of days , which cares no whit
Whence jarring discord hath assail 'd it thus ? "
Where yet no tyrant has his purpose gained ,
Still follow fortune where she leads the way . ]
Then came the sin of tristram and isolt ;
I seem to breathe the blossoms that she wears .
Whose breast is corroded with anguish so deep
A terrible thing to be pestered with poets !
Would say what others only felt ;
And morn a new politeness took ,
These ' pilgrim fathers ' found a state
All his own power infuse , to swell
In paradise , and on a hill made halt ;
Unto his fireside greetings brought .
But soon there came a dismal cry
For his faith he kept so well ;
Take care , in your desire to please ,
And make a great sensation for a day .
You will not reach me regulus his fate ?
And then , while round them shadows gathered faster ,
Though care leaves a shadow on thy manly brow ,
The punishment of life , which saw thine end
That 's sown by quarrelsome sinners .
That lay in the house that jack built .
Whose brain took madness of the mountain wind .
But when he swept its chords along ,
Their ruthless hands could never rend and tear
Saw that this sensuality
A bird broke forth and sang ,
There shines i know not what of the divine ,
Till the full circle of the year came round .
The genial meads , assign 'd to bless
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
Each with a headache sat her sire and i.
Nor greatly joyed the argives , where they lay
Where thunder torrents beat .
And melt the icicles from off his chin .
And snatch wings for my spirit ere its time .
Then valor got its well-earned pay ,
Trap ! trap ! went the gray ;
Love calls to war :
The strange conditions which this stranger brings .
So now the full band is followed
Yet feel their haughty hearts untamed -
Three younger monks set forth to close
Answered in the words which follow :
Their hair along the mountains rolled and filled
A rolling gait gathers remorse .
More branches bring , and try the wonderous change
Her little steps with little steps attending .
In whose grey eyes such steadfast anger burned ;
Therefore his glorious arms did thetis give
Your eyes , that looked on glory , could discover
Too sweet to leave for such a dream .
As now it shines -- all love and light ,
It almost makes you cry
As the light clouds of autumn flee ,
And found no respite from her woe .
Immediate ruin each delay attends ,
Well pleased with fruits his bravery bore him .
And through your brain the whisper comes ,
At football i kick all the goals ;
Which traces of his chariot showed ,
She breathed as if breath had failed ,
Losing her woes in shows of discontent .
Desire of action , bringing pain ,
With cloudy chaplets , such as might have bound
Answered in the words which follow :
My flute might make ; such subtle harmonies
With feeble limbs crawled forth , and felt the spring
Than these fine works which mark the bound
While ilion like a mist rose into towers .
Thus cruelly shorn of her birthright ,
It should not bring amazement to thy face . "
Amidst such scenery he would sometimes take
To earth a miracle to show men here .
'till reason 's morn shall on him break !
Death found him there , without grandeur or beauty .
That brought me hither or that prompts my lips
Decree us to sustain a length of woes .
Vengeance to thee , to thee revenge belongs .
And helmet lay ; short troubled slumbers stole ,
Your limit , oft returning with the tide .
And leave no room for sadness to creep in .
In which my mind its numbers caught .
And stretched around the wilderness , as rude
But when did kindness fail to find
That omen , and his visage fell .
It needs the voice of nature . the sublime ,
Sleep will not take the place of love ,
The exploring soul whose eye had read mankind ?
And in the gallery took his sunday place , --
Where chasteness fails there concord will decay ,
Some gleam of heaven reflected be .
Without the sun to make the shine ,
And hides thy folly 's faults ,
Subdued with influence , and controlled with dread
Where fields are lost or crowns won unawares .
My gloomy soul receives a gleam of joy .
Who , when his race is run ,
And keeps the spirit clean .
And beat down the blossoms of may
And made it by the touch of purest joy
What he through love had lost , to reacquire
Put leaves out , took firm root ,
The heat commanding in my heart doth sit .
Hast thou attempted greatness ? then go on :
Which the first wealthy father took from thee ! "
And now trails slowly through a city 's heart ,
The low , wild verses go ,
Her distress would leave us rueing ;
“ that future times with less contempt behave :
Gives baths , gives fishes , rivers , bays ;
Year after year unknown to sex proceed ;
Or calm it lies , with canvas furled .
Nor yield the key for life 's profaner voices
The same endeavour to make you believe ,
Though sunlight make the outer branches hoar .
Sent up from fifty throats a mighty shout ,
His distance seemed to shorten , and his mind
" thy freedom nurst her sacred energies ;
And pain is missed in praise .
Fishes shall rise , and banquet on thy flesh .
How philip put her little ones to school ,
For while they filled her eyes with fire ,
Of mortal pain , and chemistry 's fixed laws ;
That offering i accept , lovingly made
Pine-trees show its fires ,
Ay , till your brother finds the flaw .
Gathering courage from despair :
Forget the ancient care that taught and nursed
The little lark goes soaring high
Then welcome is this news he brings ;
Take note , my lady , that your way
To spend ourselves , and never count the cost ,
The golden wand , that causes sleep to fly ,
Will sue where love is met with scorn :
Nor has death thus overcome you ,
" she intends to give us battle ,
And the menacing seas rolled all between .
And he is left his willful rage to rue ,
Fires like a blow ; calling the righteous flush
Heart-fancies flashing heaven 's hue --
The frantic despair that throbs in his head .
The briarrose shakes its sweet perfumes ,
Where silent myrtles , stately laurels rise ,
We seek to grasp the truth , it quickly flies
Like champions mailed for clanking war ,
Brings all sweet memories of the lost past back ,
It turneth to his influence felt ,
Who wrought the thing in days gone by ,
Swift her feet could go ;
And the sad wind comes and sighs and goes ,
Only the echoes , which he made relent ,
The yellow wine that keeps the angels young --
Whence comes the change ? ’ twere easy told
What flowers find heart to die .
And all that to such revelry belongs ; --
Where feebly comes the mournful roar
If toil and trouble and pain are found ,
She gets the upper sky and wind ,
In order that thou see with how great reason
Till the stars had run away ,
I like roses , born of the heat ,
It keeps me warm in greenland 's frost ,
He also took ten talents forth of gold ,
The princess maud him took , in virtue 's lore
An anguish , gathers earth to lie
In gallant ships have spread the sea ;
To give new pleasure like the past ,
Like the light a mourner sees
And the life-tree 's waving soft .
Succeeding in smooth seas when storms are laid ;
And , as a garment , put on rage ,
Sic silly things my mind ne'er taught ;
All my heart went out to him !
And apple-trees have shaken from their hair
Worth being rich to hold in fee .
And face our foolish fancied fears like men .
And some are up because they kept their pluck .
Did not let this bring me sorrow ,
Before the sacred altar made him bleed ,
Barefooted boyhood comes again to me .
Held high in honour , and the land
Skill ’d to discern the future by the past ,
That sucked like sadness at the brain ,
I ’d follow this music wharever it went .
To get the letters , and obey the wish
Which a nice little boy stood ready to catch
Oft our fathers ' hearts it stirred ,
Where the mother that left you years ago
The rights and duties pledged to all ?
( the old dutch clock it told me so ,
From clasping love so high ,
To the swedish king they took their way .
The seeds that we have sown .
Or be counted vulgar and set at naught .
And happiness walks hand in hand with care ,
From the hard season gaining ? time will run
But , set beneath his body squat and fat ,
While the hours danced round the dial
There shines a face i have not seen
This fell when christmas lights were done ,
The novelty did make me much admire
Soon the sun 's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
Will go on better for it . holy father ,
And music , went to camelot :
First came the loss of light , and air ,
War upon war laid nations at thy feet
And in the song it mingled . and the dame
From the shadow of death he set jim free .
For finding it a poorish trade ,
Artists , when their subjects treating ,
I can hear their voices calling ,
The crown attracted many a care ,
Then her hair the maiden gave him ,
To fetch delights for luxury at home :
The world is gone , torn into shreds
There seek my lost repose ,
Whom late the nation he had led ,
Naught but death relief can give --
He falls ; and in his measurement is found
Racing dawn , the carriages come home , --
That shakes a demon in his fiery lair ;
Should that morn come , and show thy opened eyes
Then raged the battle wild and dread ,
" yonder the fatal emblem lies !
In hungry rage consuming all .
The roasted entrails first they shared , then fill 'd
An ' all the while his trade went down !
Heart-music stirred
She thinks i lead and live too merry days .
Its last faint beam hath fled ,
She breathes a loftier , purer atmosphere ,
But age comes on ; with sudden shock
Envy , which biting inwards did corrode
Only in ancient books their fame is told .
Answered in the words which follow :
Each instant echo to our song .
Who only helped to swell his fame .
Gives this answer to her suitor :
Whose mad feet beat the flags beneath ,
_ because no clouds went , drifting by , _
I like roses , born of the heat ,
And turn to god and grace ;
Made to be fashioned as the artist wills ,
Why should we leave the homes our fathers reared ,
Work makes us cheerful and happy ,
By the leaping skies o'erhead ,
Must follow them above
To him the honour meet he paid
As all their souls in blissful rapture took :
And that they make no rivalries of strength !
By penance purged as if by flame :
Declining years shall run ,
And from my weeping eyes her cliffs withdrew ;
Which still increases as it goes , and ever
With this good squadron went the desperate fay ,
Thou art to all lost love the best ,
That plays around it , like the radiance
In the shadow time has cast ;
And the busy morning cries came thin and spare .
Not hope to make her understand at once .
She took her little porringer :
Yet with main strength his strokes he drew ,
As the unfathomed seas , where lost worlds sleep
The victory had won :
There on a fir , whose spiry branches rise
Of chariots that him convey ,
All the love which now i smother
Summer has come , winter has gone ,
And makes the silence ring with sound .
O , feel the woe-waves break !
Where falling low , the source of day descends ,
Orange and green will carry the day !
Out , leaving the soul in dusk
To chase fatigue and fear :
When the birthday honors came ,
The trembling aspen , the noble pine ,
While still the autumn leaves are shed ,
Beneath which beauties lurks a wanton heart
Now love was buried ; and despair had flown
Ye winged hours that o'er us past ,
Since here usurping venice arms for fight ,
That might escape the lips of one who dies .
Traced the azure on her eyelids , --
And make it serve the purposes of men ,
The falling rain that bears the greenery ,
Guittone , giving him the prize , till truth
Kiss me with kisses that leave not a trace ,
He 'd made a fortune tanning leather ;
Oft hath a berry risen forth a shade ;
The rights and duties pledged to all ?
I shall put off this service bound on me .
Coming to my daughter 's marriage ,
Keats is beauty while earth spins round !
That in thy sweets all sweets encloses ,
And on her eyes and mouth mad kisses pressed .
Who will invent a mirror that will lie ?
While through this poor land range the heathen men ,
On airy sails float forth his sighs ;
Thy guide and pattern , gentle cowper take .
Extol your theories , proffer your advice ,
One day -- then comes the feast enchanting
To kiss thy lips from which it flows ! "
The very heaven beamed with the light sublime
And asked the public to take note , and punish
To god , -- should take another view
That where it on a finger sat ,
Is founded every virtue , came to thee . "
Meriones the axes bore away ,
To croon the dewy songs they take
Now their broad black beaks they lifted ,
To the sky the flame rose upward ,
Scarce here and there stirring the single trees ,
Last night the sun went pale to bed ,
Where loyal souls of love and faith are found ,
Would nature thither turn the pores of earth
And in an age of faith grown frore
Then sweeps the royal esther by ;
It says how glorious to be
Those images which take a hold on eyes
First singing they to their own music moved ;
So are the heavenly statutes set , and those
In flying fragments shot the evening 's flame ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
As plainly proves , experience dwells with years ;
The sweetest melody that flows
Would be legal , if lawyers it tried .
Bitter sharp tremblings and soft languors rise .
That spurs him hath a softer spell ;
_ here where the sword united europe drew _
A wasted chance . fate knows no tears .
Of poverty was thrust deep into me :
Friends make pretence of following to the grave ,
Whither comes that cheery call :
And , waking up , snap goes the slight
Nor did they dare without the walls to stand
The lord that led him alone could tell !
They take their stand where frenchmen never failed
That life should seek its golden prime , --
Surely thy spring-time shall prevail . "
To cut and come , to race and stay .
While the dew fell in showers from the passion flowers
Thou shalt cull spring 's sweetest flowers ,
And pushing commerce , trade to pile up gold ,
Until her pity almost overbore her .
Amid the merry talk would flow ;
Is how the death was cruel which i met :
Of how indigestion is fostered and bred ,
So he ne'er got the switch again ;
Where a valley of tall white lilies slept
While beckoning stars smile from the silent skies .
So far they roamed , so near they drew ;
By merit raised in ribaldry and guile ,
Winds came howling from the south-west ,
The golden barks of lovely summer that set out ,
His high behest drew nations to the field :
Till all the coward thoughts of death gave way .
Made his heart yearn again , musing so wearily
To gain the winning-post with one ahead .
When our two souls stand up erect and strong ,
That are most modest ere they come to war .
While woe and darkness span the earth ?
In the hush the evenings bring .
And happiness in every nook be found !
All loves , but one that turned to grief .
But no arrow followed after ;
Of its abysses , swaying to and fro
Whose scattered glories mark the moment spent ;
Sincere reveals the sanction of the skies ;
As old memories come to thee .
Because things have n't gone his way .
I feel them , as the leaves and flowers
To pay the life you gave ?
And cheerful turn , when the long shadows fall
To change your day of youth to sullied night ,
Which takes the lead in freedom 's band ,
Where the aspen 's shadows play ;
Like talons darting up to clutch the sky .
They lost the power to check the flow ;
Is gone for bigotry .
Thei make him love in such a rage
Had left him vacant , and with speed was gone
With death , hope tells us is a mask
Than others would seem to the earth that belong .
And the calm pleasures always hovered nigh ;
And prayed the ghastly show might pass .
Would give a slaughterman the joes !
Who loves that beauty should go beautifully ?
Or he whose virtue sighed to lose a day ?
That the spring-days soon will reach us ,
And put the business past all kind of doubt .
For ony wife i see !
And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion .
But their wonder soon see cause to smother ;
Freedom , that leaves us more confined ,
Through camp and fleet the monarch took his way ,
Disparity made clear ; the eye of god
I held as one who goeth reverently .
Than all things can suffice to make us happy :
The wintry storm has blown .
Harmless upon the ground it lay
And made for her both wise and simple weep ,
The sun with resting pulses seems to brood ,
A moment cast a shadow and float by ;
The beacon shaken in the storm ,
Swim , sink , strike out for the dawn .
My wife if she be counted , sunk away
And beat him from her with a lotus leaf .
The poor were reduced to the verge of starvation .
It follows then , that those who sin
Are stirring in his breath ; a thousand flowers ,
Nor winter 's rattling boughs lack lusty green .
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought :
And grace with vigour wisely blends ;
It speaks to grief : ' be comforted ;
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice ,
As theirs , poor phantoms . so went she
Who blindly follow , ever ,
Addressed the sage , as near he drew :
Oft sends a gorgeous vision , gallant crews
Dark hills whose heath-bloom feeds no bee ,
In the days long since departed ,
Who makes me shed the silent tear .
Its anguish can relieve .
In the wall 'd cities the way passes through ,
A fragrant breath to tell of flowery places
And left to pomp no attribute but awe ;
Which a grove of myrtles made ,
What sorcery fashioned thee ?
The village preacher 's modest mansion rose .
And the dame felt defeated ,
‘ my sovereign prince , some counsel take ,
They railed upon the senseless throng
Nor any bed to give the shew
To man she gave to improve , adorn ;
And the close texture does the dregs retain .
That some time came , and went away ;
And to the rank that borders on the throne .
And after april , when may follows ,
It makes your heart into a bird
The stars came out : arcturus hung
Entirely omnipresent , weigh ’d with judgement clear ,
Rolls the majestic hymn that inspirates the seer .
Tidings send to hiawatha ! "
Where the poor young dogs had sunk .
Love eyed his rosy memories : he sang :
Never transfused and lost in what she loved ,
Of wifely labor wrought with pain ,
And thus the dame her answer made :
For blunt denial , ere the suit be made .
While that immortal shape stood warder there .
The last tear they shall ever shed --
This precipice had not yet fallen down .
That i felt some ill thing came behind
While the sign of battle flew
Where i find her not , beauties vanish ;
Hailed the fair town that met their eyes .
How it came to an end !
It will make thee fair and lovely .
And as she marked their rivalry in might ,
To catch a note of thy dear praise .
Of all the centuries yet to come ,
I 'll give thee tears . --
Our garden gives no scent so fresh as thine ,
And then , to go to sleep ;
I thought of your arms that held me tight ,
For which this earth has journeyed though the
Not only health but sad to name ,
The aspirations strong for glory won ;
That in my bosom lies .
With an eternal glory -- which , if made
For those who often seek the bridge of prayer .
See small marino joins the theme ,
Must fourteen years by me be passed .
The fearful seat no man had ever taken .
A bower of leafy branches made ,
And shifting lights across the long black roads .
Does power , or wealth , attend the dead ;
The spirit , first , of my companion came ,
And rest and get the country air . she said
I read a poet 's mystic lay ;
That round and round the linden blossoms play ;
I made bad worse : to liquor flew :
Their birth from trunks and rugged oaks they drew ;
Another corner held the wretched fate
What this day fortune offers to our eyes ,
But he drank the air as though it held
I charge thee by the solitude he kept
For precious memories often grow
' this is the duke of athens drawing nigh ,
Of the blossoms , i assume ,
Your wisdom aided , what their counsels framed --
Stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief .
The lord made answer unto peter , " nay ,
The shingle cottage stood , a humble home .
Into her private cell when nature rests .
And all went merry as a marriage bell .
Of their own virtue , and pursuing
His lilies newly blown ;
One thing all say , dear ,
( as tennyson has pointed out )
To chace the gloom , fresh spirits come ,
The worship all her deeds make manifest :
That led into the dark and bloody ground .
And watch her fire-lit needles flit
And winter fell and cold december came ,
Yet pierces to the sky !
And turning them to healthful nutriment !
Here stands to crush the rebels that o'errun
Their prize escaped the faithless pirates mourn 'd ;
Of thoughts -- like those some sunset brings
Thy ken directed to the point , whereat
Soon as the rising eagle cuts the air ;
All the meadows wave with blossoms ,
Shall come two days like these :
And so the festival went on . at last ,
And from her fell the burden of her woes ;
With raging fury burn ;
He was an easy man to give penance ,
And in the hush that followed the prayer ,
That forgets the drowsy words it has to say .
Beyond the rest was filled with valour and strength
With the bright gems which wisdom loves to keep ;
Was lost in the balmy air .
And the sun , ever shifting , ceaseless lends
Calm lay the large rude nature of the north ,
Which filled them with bright anger and surprise !
The piper 's face fell , and he cried ,
But still as wilder blew the wind ,
All africa that bore the roman yoke
Ulysses following , as his partner slew ,
All those bright natures which adorned its prime ,
The nations shall take note . his unripe age
And from his lips there broke the haunting cry :
But whoso takes his cross , and follows christ
Whereof to one because thou life hast given ,
His muzzle who lay prone now forward goes ;
That heaven would keep our spreading eagle calm
Is there nae poet , burning keen for fame ,
The tyranny . this her voice within them told ,
To know a secret that the gods would keep .
According to his greatness whom she quenched .
About my lips their kisses burned .
Chaos would have come again ,
Than all earth 's wisdom could have given .
" to scatter death , by fire and sword ,
Must have risen to blight her wedding-day .
And devilish machinations come to nought . "
All-elegant , within it placed the gold ,
Here do the moonbeams come , slithering , wandering
I ai n't got arthur 's luck . "
That my vengeance shall not reach him ! "
By the holy love he beareth ;
Burn the sea 's gray bound away --
And sacred night her awful shade extend . "
The wind has summoned , and i go , --
" we gave the name of neptune to our prize
Observance , reverence cast aside ; and measure
His rays resistance met . i turn 'd aside
From memory glide away !
To bounding joy , and make young pulses beat
Joy reigned majestical once more .
The hurrying tempest swept .
He looked for silence , but a thunder came
And fear finds nothing left to mend .
Do i not find within thy radiant eyes
The preacher droned in soothing tones about
Tracking the dream star that lights the purple gloom .
She listen 'd with a flitting blush ,
With thee will take my way . ”
And spent with fruitless labour grieve .
That love and kindness can protect no more ;
The glittering spires that pierce the brow of heaven ?
And at his heart there may have gnawed
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Still hoping love would watch it grow and ever
Earth draws her close . how warm
Where forests round them rise ,
But feel the shock renewed , nor can efface
That made him so completely great :
For he is grasped of god .
Her sullen silence , and with fury spoke :
For the cross of our faith is replanted ,
Whose spirit mounted on seraphic wings ;
All in silver , housed in azure ,
She shines on thieves on the garden wall ,
When i stood up for age-long wars
But where thermometers sunk down to ten ,
To overthrow , perchance uproot the race .
Is wine , banishing sleep ! )
Which long did wait , came to him straight ,
So a voice murmured mid the achaean host .
It fell upon the maiden 's robe ,
Danger and death had found the woman 's love
Of freedom -- where nought comes to taint ,
And bring the pleasant hours that we abide ;
Set flame upon his tongue : his wearied limbs
They see alps piled on alps far on extend ;
And from the other circles set me free .
" the seasons come and go :
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
Is there he gives the proper information .
Would pierce the veil of mystery round thee thrown .
Saw from each eye escape a swollen tear ;
Whose hand shall serve , whose pen shall draw ,
Brass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold ,
And deal a wound that lingers ;
A weight of sorrow hung ;
Line , form and color live in me ;
By nature fashioned , even as seeds of things
Nothing could conquer that heart of thine .
Answered in the words which follow :
As in the golden hours gone by .
So , naturally he ran in debt --
Her words are glued here so ! ... i remember
This faint heart surely must hold ,
And love , with music taken
Fleeing the darkness , the eyes seek the city ,
For morals , marriage ; and this question carried ,
A velvet gown all set with pearls ,
When gentle death shall bid it cease to beat ,
It chanced a bee did fly that way ,
But generations go and come ,
" from their strict union takes her name ,
Law louted lowly as that wealth advanced .
Hath put within thine ears the stores of proofs
At the winter 's returning ,
When the other firms show dizziness
Like the ash that shoots the spark ?
For love that smiled in april
How meg wi ' toothache girnin ' sat
Fury that 's long fermenting is most wild .
Or break the shafts of pitiless remorse ?
To give a glad relation of the past ,
You make but a paltry show of resistance ;
And yet how still the landscape stands ,
In the days when my heart-trials came ;
And many red fierce poppies splashed the wheat ;
" the slow south-wind comes amorously ?
Wailing went the wawonaissa ,
Veiling in gray the landscape stretched between
And stanleys made their world adore them ,
Now hath passed from sense of sun and rain :
Nor stayed the carnage till the day was done .
That follows after prayer .
And hope has enwreathed it round with flowers ,
For the souls that sit in sadness
Her birds they would build in her hair ;
But kindness has melted the captive 's rage .
Without the picture be found true .
And his heart opened with the love he had
How thou art come into a happy land ? --
He , from his face removing the gross air ,
In dreamy sleep they lost their pain ,
And showing charms , as loth to show ,
The hand that swept these lives away
I woke -- and found my dream was true .
The sails that o'er his waters stray .
Lest a bloody fight should follow .
On love -- her pride gave way too late .
That can be broken with a last warm kiss !
Whom time hath render 'd poor and gray ;
Thou art inside all love man ever bore ;
And promise which the prince had made .
And with his sable blood soaking the plain .
Transfus 'd on thee his ample spirit rests .
That secret rare , between the extremes to move
When christ to the dread judgment goes .
The manner of my falling into sleep .
At once their souls were yielded forth to air .
And round about in infinite numbers lie ,
I could worship every little step she takes ;
And a chuckle ran round the assembly .
And the quick tears drown my eyelids ,
Enters the day that brought the kiss :
Fierce shout and cry around him rang :
His triumphs on distended pinions bore .
And all the winds wandering along the shore
It stood in the light ;
Its quick interrogating eyes fixed keen
That fits the business of the day .
While death stands victor by ,
Love went grieving , -- love who saves :
Music still came , but with it came alloy ,
In these domestic grounds , may bear his name ;
The warmest blessings which a muse can give ,
And lift her veil of night and mystery ;
" weird triads tell us that our nature knows
And still , as thirst and hunger drove ,
The social shades the same dark journey go ,
Hath struck the christmas hour .
It burns my heart i must depart ,
Unless , as you the chance may see ,
Fused through all creation flows ;
The old stone manor-house my childhood knew .
The night that covers and the lights that fade ,
The amber honey sucked from myriad flowers ,
And in eight the news she carried ;
( as stories tell ) and published at last
Cold as the breath of winds that blow
The flowery wreath to mark the sacrifice ,
' there passed a weary time . each throat
Shrill with the piercing cold , and every cave ,
They sailed and sailed , as winds might blow ,
These sights and sounds brought pleasure to his mind ,
Fresh breezes blew , and sunbeams strayed ,
Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised .
But shadows ever man pursue .
Reflection of fair light that doth our senses take .
" a lifeless ghost all day i pine ,
Were in some part neglected and made void . "
A sadness steals about the heart ,
Such as saints feel for sister-souls above ,
Swift they go to the ravenous guns ,
What homage should men pay to thee ,
And left them groggy at the nineteenth hole .
Till the pure spirit comes again .
His beard swung on a wind far out of sight
Summer set lip to earth 's bosom bare ,
With their baptismal names anchored here ,
Of slumber did her beauty hold him thrall .
Of eblis it was made ,
While life hath a kiss . "
The friendly gossip come from every land ;
Thy judgment ; they transform the wise to fools ,
Each one a million years , between us lies .
“ attempt to manage . every power we grant
The place itself the sister 's tale disclosed .
Such have not seen themselves sunk in depravity .
Doth from the vision , that reflects the scene .
The shadows raced across the blind .
At concert met with lengthen 'd throat
Swells in his throat and gathers in his eyes ;
None deals a death more horrible in form .
That the eternal beauties it unfolds .
Love bears the warrior 's pall ,
I would give to you a ring ,
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites ,
The wonder of all eyes that look upon her ,
Her breath comes quick , her tired beauty glows ,
Against his soldiers made this battle sore ;
With another rhyme . deuce take it ,
Why hast thou suffered man to make the town ?
And kissed her climbing , and she cast her arms
That breathed of ocean meadows bluely rolled .
And hollow groans from her deep spirit came .
Our melting flesh fixed beauty there , a star ,
With eyes fixed on the ground -- not tartarus
Thy perfumed valleys where the twilights dwell ,
And an evil wrought by others ,
The mad fates took the rest .
Or bring reform on superstition 's seat .
After a fixed plan and order fixed .
What souls possess themselves so pure ,
We felt it glide from the silver sands ,
The rich and royal nuptials they prepare
He sails to crush his country 's foes ,
We felt the pulsings of nature 's throng ;
But fire has forced it to unfold ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
Nor brought to me such joy
If wealth is gone -- then something is gone !
So fierce this battle raged . the emir calls
That at rare times and rapt he felt
The gleaming rushes lean a thousand ways , --
And full soon then he gained the race ,
The loving glances she bestowed ,
Warm odors from the hayfield wander by ,
Then of fright and dread the kings flung
The scattered stars smiled thro ' the pines ;
Pointing the arduous way that heavenward lies ;
It gives a very echo to the seat
The blood having touched it , contracting and shrivelling
And youth , still flashing from his eyes
By twenty years to gather books and read
That the time might pass more gayly ,
I felt as though you knew this cursed charm ,
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything ,
But gout , with other ills came on ,
A nation , which has newly learned to give ,
In him perfection did set forth
Fell on him , dissipating all his cares .
Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state ,
And make the tour of all the spheres .
We 've supped sorrow , tasted joy ,
There silence speaks , and shade gives light :
Leaving no trace of tyranny , but just
I bend to catch its murmur in silent ecstasy ;
As once pursued our howling flight to hell ?
The far peaks faded from their sight ,
The youthful rovers follow .
And now thy sullen notes send darkness through me ,
The vales redoubled to the hills , and they
An understanding that fills one with fear .
He made this pretext , that his princedom lay
When muttering thunders roll along the sky .
And soon the prison gained ;
In her his breath found music and a name .
Such is the peace that lovers find ,
But the god fostering her chilled hand ,
It speaks to earth of peace .
Than solon guessed , or plato saw ;
That his hand was stretched to seize him ,
Each mansion , as the car went by ,
Her heart to his she laid ;
The wealth of cottage warmth that comes
Courage was never designed for show ;
Strike ! with every blow is given
White faces seemed to peer .
Among the constellations war were sprung ,
The town of mexico -- huge cities form 'd
There kept my charms concealed from mortal eye ,
While the other sweeps the waters .
Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil ,
As onward to its aim it passed .
And gave the achaeans glory . achilles ' son
The morsel fell quick by the place
These secret thoughts enwrap me so in anguish
Has swept through the land and aroused us forever ;
The wild stream sweeps away .
Wrung their mournful music forth .
To bring the dread disease to grace bernard .
These old confessors vex me so !
The claims of truth , all lead me there .
Was caught up into love , and taught the whole
Leaving the pathway clear , we shrink in pain ,
Now all thy charms apply ;
The pleas 'd spectators peals of shouts renew ,
Comes him a southwind from the scented vine ,
To make glad intimates of these : --
And faith that fights the battle through ,
Dreams often more than waking passions move .
They who trust him wholly find him wholly true .
And the mountains brim with mist and sun .
" black milk from the first was flowing ,
One fair shade lingered in the fuller day ,
And youth commands the growing boy to bloom
In the sound his breathing kept ;
Perhaps the scalp with barbarous fury torn ,
Which simply would have been embarrassing you see .
They press upon us in its early dawn ,
There 's little changed , i see .
Rocked the fire of the creator ,
We steal men 's all to make for wealth --
Or to handle the viol with skill ,
And suddenly we realized his body held a soul .
But love it is gives life .
And flowers sprang up about her feet
That fed the blow-fires in the sheds
And living flowers , the best september knows ,
Like echoes softly flung from rock and hill ,
Had followed magnus for the senate 's cause
Joy in his eyes a radiance made
Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
And still before them a great ripple sent .
He passed away . him followed then
The light , that lies
What though her heart be rent asunder ,
Like wind the untold millenniums passed .
( how slow the leaden minutes ran ! )
His cries are lost in laughter ,
So with a half-sigh soon sank back again
The peace of breda then succeeded ;
All shall see and be
Now rings the woodland loud and long ,
And life has grown dull on the station ,
The neck untrained to bear the yoke .
Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff .
All lay in religion as part of their stock .
Conviction made him strong ;
Quick the fearful pain departed .
Sic beautiful scenes might give pleasure the while ;
And a doctor that took the sum ;
That was my way of going into bankruptcy .
Whose breathless thought so briefly stays ,
And the wind arose and tossed it ,
Time sculptures it to suit his whim .
But if in death the cold waves swallow -- ?
And it was she who took my life .
O rose i set within my paradise .
And meet life 's peaceful evening with a smile .
We bleed anew in every former grief ,
All now is silent ; groans are fled ;
Kindled , thy ken a higher flight shall mount ;
Not a spar that comes to grief !
A thrill before it passes .
Time 's scythe shall reap but bliss for me
And dark clouds , drifting drearily ,
The marble all those other names revealed .
King cole made silence : then addressed the crowd .
Far through my heart the mingled music ran ,
Thus death made way for liberty !
For if we cast them on the flowing stream ,
My faint spirit was sitting in the light
Yon rising moon that looks for us again --
Whence sorrow never chased thee ; with thee bring ,
None could desire she other gifts should bring ;
Spoke his thoughts in words that follow :
As has been shown in former verse ,
Levity too often leads astray ,
-- that only serves to make us grieve
Catch the dry mountain , and its shades devour ;
As death , composed to bear !
Our faces show , but that is naught ;
With sad face set towards the year , that sees
There comes the smell of earth and leaves ,
Fell soft as flying snowflakes
Their bosoms bathe in diamond dew ;
The solemn dirge ; achilles led the strain ;
 the murmur that springs
The praises sing
And the mouldering dust that years have made
Shifting her side , short respite seeks from pain .
Its height ascended , where two cressets hung
Her apron gave , as she did pass ,
Filled the evening star with music ,
And nervous distraction will rack with its pains ;
We keep each other in our heart .
The strength prayer offers to a suffering soul .
So runs our loyal dream of thee ;
To note at once if jimmy drooped his head ,
Those eyes that mirrored all eternity ,
The scarlet salvia showered with spurts of fire ;
Imperfect , ere its organs gave it birth .
There lay the sound and the island with green leaves
Has mingled with the funeral knell ;
Better far to take their chances
What the magician took , the duke attack .
There passed in converse and sweet harmony .
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
What pass 'd , what was felt or spoken --
The blue sky bounds the ocean ,
" from greece thy earliest splendor came ,
For that sweet semblance she did make
Think of the day that gave it birth ,
Set thy guard over us ,
Soon a time will come for singing ,
To make thy maids and self free mirth ,
No fragment tells where once the wonder stood ;
Transgressors marks , and punishes all wrong ,
And william took his seaward way
When to the helm of state your country call 'd
The drowning struggled and cried ,
Its death and life combine in thee .
Of her hair went lavishing
Had i na found the slightest prayer
The fields of captain richardson lay ;
Of piety as too severe . to cast
My breath came short , and scarce at all .
Who got ten years for blasphemy ,
To catch some new and bright idea ,
From whom no fair return was made ,
That i might burst all bondage of control ,
What strains are these that echo clear ?
In hollow echoings gave again the sound .
To spoil her marriage , and besides , she cares
To the artist that had made it
And therein makes strange characters , which hold
But us lead thou to circe 's dread abode .
How men torment themselves takes my attention .
You should not fill your head with foolish dreams .
Such as by nature to the ancients shown ,
And beautiful immortals pass their days in peace ,
Work , not worry , brings success .
That turned ten thousand verses , now stands still ?
When he awoke , he found it a joke ,
They bring delight , they bring heartache ;
The lilacs where the robin built ,
And darkness shows its grandeur by the light .
Not one that in my ear till morning hung .
And mischief finds for idle hands to do .
And so our smiles are steeped in tears ,
These crawling centuries of lonely woe
But from his burying of two queens he drew
Poor soul so sunk in sin he could not see
Or the waves had brought thee hither ,
Of sweeter sadness chased the smile away .
Filled my heart to overflowing .
In swarms ideal urge their airy flight ,
That made him very rich .
Though lulled in sleep his senses lie
And snatch a fearful joy .
Which him upon that desert isle had thrown :
That such a misfortune should give her such pain ;
" in --- 's puffs exhaled our lives away --
Gold crushed from the quartz of a crystal life ,
From fleshly chain that binds mortality ,
Enlarged winds , that curl the flood ,
And to strengthen each soul that strives .
Your guess at truth will hold .
And lift the mortgage from that poor cheap guy ;
The glowing embers did the myrmidons quench
And then his piteous tale of sorrow said ,
When erring man shall all his rights retrieve ,
The weary moon had turned away ,
That " isis taught rebellion to her sons ? "
Shall leave no vestige of this flower .
As the gleam from a homestead through darkness will show
Powerful of charms , bid every grace attend ;
That the cold wind makes in rivers .
All the glimpses that upon me shone .
To hide the fault i see ;
They left the fury of the fight ,
Errors were made by our fathers of old .
Why thought seeks refuge in lone caves , yet rife
Death 's strong fetters bind my tongue . "
Poets are bound a loud applause to pay ;
My weakness still embrace ;
And laughs the vale as the bright waters glide .
Which -- far as woman 's thought could sound ,
And the warships plowed through the cloven tide ,
The golden trumpets blew a blast
Where , diligent to catch the first faint gleam
By what grace the heavens do move . _
In waving circles whirled a fun ' ral brand :
The river weeps as it leaves the fell ,
The two who hold their home together .
Upon all sides that wintry tempest fell .
What he has made of woman . to him turned
From his magic blade flowed honey ;
The battle winks and thuds in blundering strife .
The waves stood still to hear him ,
The powers that wage unceasing war ,
You had followed the self-same train
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
And gave a boon they long possessed :
Evil fate might rise against thee ;
Cure of her sickness lies in other hands ,
Sends the fever from the marshes ,
Despair and death come swallow me ,
And he alone the victor 's tale can tell .
And the gay flag that waved o’erhead .
Let thy heroes buckle on their sabres ,
Her hospitable rites she pressed .
Or he had found her gay .
Then silence followed ; then began
While wretched life remains .
Entered the dame , and there her haven made .
Like the dark eternity to come ;
And lost , and ready to despair ,
Like heavenly cars that float in air ,
To rank and wealth are given ;
And harvest-fields , its mystic splendor rests !
With worthier works concerned , display his wares !
That pierced the eyeballs through .
And daily spreads till gay perfections shine ;
Thus so far independence brought
Which he than man more harmless found and mild .
By the blind fish that leap against the winds ;
Should not each warning give a strong alarm ?
Sooner than where the stars of christmas burn ?
The wind howled by ; the passionate water leapt ;
What war could ravish , commerce could bestow ,
Nor left he heirs to share his powers .
Thy worn-out heart will break at last --
Leaving never a trace of their gay little selves
Across sad leagues that sink and rise
Midway the stars moved silent through the sphere ;
Making a shambles of the outraged ocean .
Where many a glorious banner played ;
To turn the navy from its fatal course :
But answer got she none .
And now comes in my happy hours ,
My dear , the time has come to say
I told it not , my wrath did grow .
With chant alternate pour the adoring song ,
Which takes the sun and bears the vines
Beauty smiles , and love shall live .
The secret virtue of each herb that springs ,
On a fiend-like wind it curled along
The world her light is giving ?
In the very words which follow :
With asses all his time he spent ,
To break and shatter their light .
A band of phantom spirits took wings and flew
Or whitened wall provoke the skewer to write :
Youth went by and health went by
Rebellion rising , saw in whom , how spred
And will now extend them further ,
Could i stay the touch of that shriveled hand ,
As spurs thine ire and courage to provoke .
Bare are the boughs where love took cover ,
For death from sin no power can separate .
To the throne of him who made it ?
The flaming rubies show their sanguine dye ,
Hunger scowled at his scurvy mate :
Of father zeus , who bears the ægis dread
The conquered fathers : and the fell revenge
And there she sat for four long weeks ,
Thine earth now springs , mine fadeth ;
My vigils till this day be passed !
And all within made ready for solace and delight .
You can bet he did n't win them just because
" rays of him whose shadow pours
There burns a restless fever in his heart .
O month whose promise and fulfilment blend ,
And then flew out into another passion .
On distant worlds , and lost that last faint look
" mine armies dear till now have suffered woe ,
My courage sometimes rises up to my cheek ,
Where ice and snow had left their mark
And kullervo gave this answer :
Fear on devotion , joy on faith is fixed :
Like elephants ' calves go stumping :
The dog made a bow ,
Weeping shall make ye flourish all the year .
There comes a battle-cry --
And tinged her brow with an angelic light ,
Champ it like fierce teeth that eat .
Cropped lawns , where naked dryads dancing leapt
Did it rise by tongue and pen ?
Oh ! what havoc then is made ,
As poet burns came by .
Despair our joy hath doubled : he is come
Divinely bright your daughter 's virtues shone :
But my mind has fallen away from my people
The city ' of grief encompasses , which now
Which makes the crime its own blindfold redresser ,
That a spirit near me passed .
Heart ! take courage ! 't is not worthy
Forth he drew , with solemn manner ,
Loud rang his armour ; and with scornful smile
To take their death for mine .
He added , with scornful bow ,
Gift that love for love might give thee ;
Friar , read us the rules .
Pure or foul , for it makes no matter ,
Thrice welcome here ! may health revive again ,
Answered in the words which follow :
More firmly grasp my spear ; my courage mounts ,
For them that lie forlorn .
While ignorance held them in his dominion .
The ancient knight , who still took little heed
Each word she uttered falling like a stroke
What profit here pretend to gain ?
Her pair of travel worn hungry little children .
Nor fill the heart with fond alarm ;
With perfect patience . empires rose and fell ,
Merely to show your worth ,
But gazing still , over his features came
Have taken on a meaning that is new ;
And raise his base on that one solid joy ,
So lightly i played with those dark memories ,
And the other takes himself : the martial pair
The watchful angel set for truth 's defence ;
When winter came , with blustering sky ,
To feasts where pleasure waits ;
Deep in his eyes comes aching
Lean and lend for a heart distraught
And he sank in petrifaction .
For it tells , in its terrible crying ,
To it a happy name is given ;
To whom the shadows of far years extend :
Carefully the harp was carried
Flower ! the laurel still may shed
And their sad cries around him rang ,
To future years one scene of death prolong ,
For at last my time is coming . "
My son , more dear , while life remained ,
Her heavenly wisdom lose .
Thy great misfortune shall be made divine :
But public prayers imposed on heaven to give
And catch the scent of dewy hay ,
That points her charms at all she sees ,
Cold and dreary ever lie ;
" i prized every hour that went by ,
But sought to commune with the stars ,
When , from these mortal mists withdrawn ,
That i still guard in memory the dear form
The god that makes the road .
It of itself made to itself a lamp ,
We fain would stand contemplative ,
That life had never used .
Such dusky grandeur clothed the height ,
Answer made the leaning birch-tree ,
Will testimony of them e'er remain .
Set forth upon his journey perilous .
As regent prince i shared the throne ,
Veils that the spring moons wear ,
Where torrid suns the mountains burn ,
None shall bound the tender mercies
Like the gods ’ heavenly pathway showed
And catch the holy fires that burn
In the presence of others i feel so small ;
And mangled bore away the sinewy part .
Of night that knows no seasons , her black pall
Where maids have spent their hours .
To conquering love , the gods to save .
The guilt appear 'd in jamie 's cheek ;
Shall place me on mahendra ’s height .
Pressing their perfume till through and through
And took a day to follow joy :
Like to a stream that gains or loses breath ;
That lead us to beauty and singing and smiles :
This takes your faultless trousers at the knees ,
To make the fortune of quae genus :
Wild weather . the lash of the sleet
Unlike the scents that rose and lily cast
And the devil promised to let it stand ,
Provided that his care can guard
' evil only comes from evil ,
These glad , misty eyes upraising ,
The record of his life this truth did give .
And laugh to find their foe asleep ,
Then louder , as when storms begin to blow ,
It seemed a place constructed for repose ;
It mounts and sparkles in a crimson flood ,
Their hearts expanding as the world grew old ,
Wickedly born , which came to good at last --
Puck found it handier to commence
Here machiavelli 's earth returned to whence it rose .
Before we reach the land of greece .
Where light does only break the shade ;
Must such conviction come upon his head ,
Of mockery calls for younger hands to wield .
Filled the drowsy air with buzzing ,
For years , in stern privation spent ,
To have that castle fair of goodness raised :
We lay rude hands on temples not our own ,
Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters ;
For there they meet with the devil and all ;
Forth into the village went he ,
The long , seared grasses clung to every bough
It fed on smiles for sunshine ,
For that foul guilt which first took place
The fires that blast and burn ;
He bears him gently through the rushing air ,
It 's this that makes me struggle on .
The fires of wrath within him blazed .
Yet shines across her white-remembered ways
The muse give thee the delphic coronet .
In surest links of dearest friendship bound ,
The ancient ache endured ,
The minster-clock has just struck two ,
The dark , cobbled alley , and rests
His every act to day displayed ,
For his life not the slightest precaution took he .
Truth , peace , and freedom hung !
Glad is the music they ring for you ,
The poor and troubled source from which they flow ;
Who leaves such lips of nectar unsought
Shows love could wed line
Make way for our time , "
Drop the dreamy hand of love !
This made her bold in every hard assay ,
" whatever the message his to tell ,
My empty heart shall crack and break ,
The senate trembling , and when rome was ours
And filled each pause the nightingale had made .
This pair would take a walk together ,
With rains enough to set the trees a-reel
To join the emperor in his new crusade
That felt their virtues . innocence , it seems ,
All the fragrance of summer when summer was gone .
So , lifted to serener heights ,
Or meek devotion poured a prayer ,
And the sun 's flame along the blue is fed
Which turned to rapture all who gazed thereon ,
The promise past , fulfillment now is seen ,
That which before us lies in daily life ,
When winter rises from the deep ....
Repayring her decayed fashion ,
Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses ,
With eager arms stretched forth to greet ,
Was the cheek where i set my kiss ;
In love the ruddy hue declares great heart ;
Whether my bark went down at sea ,
" whence comes now my separation ,
A little boat there lay ,
Despair moaned on the lips that said
Follow her lovely footsteps home .
To carry that wonderful nose .
To load with blessings and unload from sins .
I fell in love with laura lily .
If two and one are three , they say ,
The hero see , who vanquished him !
And hardly will admit the eye of day .
Who carry all such terror in their look ,
Before him steps , and bending draws the dart :
It seemed to blow from the dying flame ,
And beneath the forge will thrust them . "
And tales that told of near , incredible shots ,
And the trumpet-notes were sprung
You always are making a god of your spouse ;
Ah me ! it makes a sinner wondrous blue ,
And as if filled with golden dreams divine ,
And the armada went to every wind !
A lean , red finger pointing to the sky ,
Yet night brings more companions than the day
But he drank the air as though it held
O nightingale , catch me his strain !
On october 's drowsy winds that whisper low .
A wreath reflecting of eternal beams .
Say , is our sense of beauty mixed with earth
The house of laughter makes a house of woe .
He felt that chilling heaviness of heart ,
And of how the seed works , and of how
His channels , as the wise have told ,
And winter 's now come fairly .
But i find i 've got no change !
Dazzling the day . and now , the rising gale
With mortal damage or dishonour meet .
Which stirs you little bubble-flies .
To thy father show my prayer
And lamps and fires make daylight on the plain ,
In those fair eyes where all perfections keep .
Like a lion , preparing to spring .
From that poor prospect turned his face away .
Endless praise to thee arises .
Rain is fast falling and filling it up .
And i , its love , am gained instead !
Whereon our tale no further could proceed ;
Is associated with the court ,
A smooth tongued sailor won her to his mind
The rising race , combined once more ,
Have followed freedom 's flowing pennon ,
The vision went , and went the living king ;
Of seals and furs had spread the canvas wing
And to them long years remain ;
Where all the poultry eyed him hard --
All lies as nature formed it , rough throughout ,
That god vouchsafes to raise another world
Shore the broad neck whence sprang the viper brood .
The twilight deepened -- but love came not .
Which told her heart was broken .
And darkness shroud it like a wintry pall ,
But an angel in heaven confronts you ;
By all the griefs his thoughts could frame ,
He has hooked them out of season ,
And the beginning hath no end .
At length his evil genius got the control .
That spreads disaster in its shadow ,
To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes ,
Still , i 'd go the world with beauty ,
What , has there e'er escaped a poet ?
And left him alone with his shame and sin .
A little world he feels and sees :
And guile is where it goes .
In whose heart all souls find refuge .
Seem 'd with old vellum to prevail ;
Desires from his heart our woes to relieve ;
Our circle whom his tale had held in thrall .
A broad red sun , split by a smile .
How my pulses leaped and stirred --
Throughout iäsian argos view thy charms ,
And shaken cities ruin down , or threaten
The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
It paints the wall , it seems to pour
That which my heart so fondly feels of thee ,
That filled the linden tree .
The first white thread that meets her there
And makes the ivy climb the oak ,
One promised land my fancy filled .
Sweet sleep , that makes more short the night .
In whose orbs a shadow lies ,
In him my lord , my life i see ,
The life of mortal man , calypso placed
Which a long season has in hunger held me ,
And greet the black barge bearing those who die
And the unkind flowers danced for joy ,
Caesar bade halt , and gave their lives to those
For by her eyes my heart is hit ,
At his dear words returning vigour came .
( of age to note it ) with disgust observes
Like a tomb-searcher , memory ran ,
But a light that the world may see ,
But morgan kept the rear , and threw
Who is the person that such grief hath bred ;
His noble wings , and left the earth behind ,
Or give the battle . caesar , in the town
While a million fiddles shake all listening hearts ,
Fall midst that peopled silence on your knees ,
That the weaver 's song may echo ,
And my youth comes back to me .
Ere warning phoebus touched his trembling ears .
My wickedness to him , and left me hope
Could his heart hide the load it bore ,
Or its enamoured touch would show
Where her few and secret poems lie , --
To follow thee fate gives me now the power :
Toil only gives the soul to shine ,
Out of their onslaught young love grew .
Where ráma ’s leafy cottage rose .
Should i let him make a fencing ? "
The sweetest eyes his eyes had ever seen
Born to toil and not to feel .
Fresh , untarnished yet -- and beauty pays .
Shall somewhat chase the cold , thy servant 's task
A temperance man caught up the word ,
The radiant image of his glory sat ,
Which he beneath his pillow had bestowed ,
If all of this could last beyond a doubt --
That bore victory to him ,
And the landlord was careful to put us in mind
Were nailed unto the cross of shame .
Those flowers made of light .
All the beauty comes from ukko . "
Who guards a people holds his post from heaven .
So it went the common road to decay .
Of the last foe is echoed by his own .
Love now warms thee , waking and sleeping ,
Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed ,
Will lead -- what beauty sits upon their brows !
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing ;
I felt what joyance all this nature has ,
Give each creation light ! "
Sleep , mindless of the happy weight they drew .
For vigil , suffering and life now spent .
Those may bear us traitors bold --
There a church arose from out the desert .
And every leaf its balm receives .
Can possibly retrieve ye half an age ;
And through the smoke there came
The figure which the spirit lost , its skin
The clock struck half-past four
Filling the air with clouds of colour and fragrance ,
Then all around the curtains drew ,
Gray dreams like frozen mists are set
The leagues of years my spirit covers ,
Come the fair emanations of her thought .
The sea that tore her child away ,
And they spread themselves to heaven .
As the squire 's head can bear a deal .
That falls at eve our fancies blow ,
Songs can the very moon draw down from heaven
To see the dawn of peace ;
And the stern rocks stand on duty ,
Have made the chain of our affection strong .
A godly man , that has served out his time
On which the universe relies , —
To save the offence of charitable , flour
A lightning tongue to scorch his cowering foes ,
To gentle bradamant ulania showed
Before the days of april 's quest arrive ?
Our hopes , like withered leaves , fall fast ;
Answered her in words that follow :
And many more when modred raised revolt ,
The rain came heavily and fell in floods ;
The maples sang and flung their banners high ,
To lighten the grief of his mind .
The turf exhaled fragrance ; among the green boughs
For we are love , and god himself is made
The love that mates the heaven weds the grave .
But bitter hours come to all :
To fall and crush the tyrants and the slaves
That the cold wind makes in rivers .
For the bold desert was he made ,
It splashes the world with gloom ;
With the triumph coming on !
The tanned lads ran , the field rode faster ,
Must manage not to breathe at all .
That holds in happier bonds this restless race ;
And , though light grows upon the dreadful deep ,
In a stir of wind that hardly shook
Now , o'er the theatre the champions pour ,
Stir the human heart of us
To his ear there came a murmur
And each one feels himself when by thy side ,
Their tameless breasts with bursting valour glow ,
I hold it the truth that no woman can be
In beauty floats amid its guardian hills ?
Which , whirling round , ran on so rapidly ,
Where the rain may fall upon me ,
Repentance offered ecstasy in pain .
Spake in haste the words that follow :
The swedish knights they held their peace ,
The lost delight may never come again .
And what i lost is real and undying .
And like its rays through amber spun
Nor that it was by necromancy made ;
All the joys that flash and pass ) ,
To the low shores mine eyes i first directed ,
Triumphal with triumphal act have met ,
Upward there fly innumerable sparks ,
Can i find here the comfort which i crave ?
May truth shine out , stand ever before us !
What fancies chaste , and loves , that grew
That hides the march of men from us .
There reach 'd the white arm of a bay ,
The boat came closer to the ship ,
Forgets his business is to laugh and bite ,
His precepts teach but what his works inspire .
It climbed the trees and lit the boughs
A vista from the waters made ,
Where carraghmore raises its brows !
If any counsel , any hope remain .
While men 's souls turn to stone .
The splendor falls on castle walls
Meanwhile came many thoughts : on me
She knew the marble shapes that set men dreaming ,
Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill .
Which painters hold , and such the heritage
And found the horror of a rule
Though the spurs have left marks of the fray ,
The unwonted scene surprise and rapture drew ;
Then i 'll give thee truthful answer . "
Enlarged winds , that curl the flood ,
Through trial sent and victory given .
Him and his mistress , making sure the will
Assumes th ' organic powers its seed convey 'd .
And histories , whose perfumes long have clung
Too burdened for the garner to be missed .
With a rough-haired terrier following fast .
Of purity the will alone gives proof ,
This glassy stream , that spreading pine ,
And as with tremulous reed his prey he drew ,
Armed servants keep their watch both there and here .
And made thy best interpreter a sigh ?
For nature knew no right divine in men ,
He fought his doubts and gathered strength ,
All full of broken lances lay the field ,
Compulsion of soul brought a sense of change ;
Four leagues this canyon runs between _ of the
The time may come when they may go
And aching with her fires that set ,
There to find the ancient wisdom ,
Of happiness it seemed to promise him ,
Straight in spain 's face let defiance be hurled !
Which own a mortal trust ,
While a kind glance at her pursuer flies ,
Spring and daisies came apace ;
Thy chance of painting them is gone ! "
The bowl and tasteful viands tempt in vain ;
And watch the trees put forth their opening buds ;
And with soft-smiling eyes the stars shall gaze
With what the world then went away and abused .
Which makes them worthy cedar and the bays .
Now lifted loud with pain and now brought low .
A year ago , come the middle of march ,
Can wound or captivate my heart .
To lay out fortune 's gifts ; and niccolo
And make him feel the pressure of the span
When they can know and feel that they have been
How turn my thoughts from heaven to thee !
Forced to withdrawal , gained the day in vain .
A spicy hay-scent rises from the meadow ,
Go straight forward to the business .
How karl hath summoned east and west .
They also led me from a virtuous wife ,
Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws ,
Away with doubts , all scruples hence remove ;
When a stitch in good time will save nine ,
And reeling through the wilderness of joy ;
Is mirrored , and the heat returned . yet move
Of sleep , my spirit saw her pass :
Growled a voice that froze our marrow :
Highly favored , that remain !
And makes a village of a great republic . "
Valiant , by no fears assailed ;
To tear it from the scanty tomb .
" my god hath given me years ,
Save where the light falls glimmering on huge bones ,
To the home of him that made it ,
When that great throng a shout did raise ,
Till clearer light should on the scheme be thrown .
Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish 'd me ;
This gentle solemn spirit doth possess ,
What should they care for the wisdom you bring .
While the winds whistle and the snows descend .
Recoverable music softly bathe
Thy work be raised , the temple will be radiant
The natural tears that slowly stole ,
The dawn is dressed in blossom and in dew ,
With slow rich colours filled and shadowy forms ,
In grief thy sallow mantle tear !
Till the white hawthorn swung and bent ,
Against the rising insolence of the mob ;
Even sorrow wear a softer shade --
He purged the stains of ancient sin ,
Is now an iron rod to bruise and breake
I gave my dearest hope of joy to her .
There was displayed no animosity ,
Then rustling , crackling , crashing , thunder down .
Or walks without stumbling ? or quenches his thirst
To find the doors of joy ;
The advertisers tossed the ball , the readers
Her marble wrought , her music breathed ;
My gazing soul would dwell an hour ,
Of night began upon the world to close )
An ' leetle fires danced all about
Meantime i give my fancy all it craves ;
We must await a mightier age to come .
Where lies the hope of all humanity .
This turn hath made amends ; thou hast fulfilled
When the stern demon , burning with disdain ,
The lights went out in the maiden 's eyes ;
Through bending boughs may reach them .
And bore me in your arms about the house
A vengeance , axe in hand , that stood
But man will ask no truce to death , --
Strong birds with fighting pinions driving forth
How shall i make a fool again ?
Which should have made clean the floor ;
To share our earthly woe .
And roared a ballad of sleet and snow
And put to proof his high supremacy ,
And makes us forget that we ever were sad ?
Innocent , righteous blood , shed shamelessly ?
Let your heart speak , minnehaha ! "
Happy , bear it to thy husband .
To hear and see what never has been told .
And big with horror traverses the fane .
Who walks forth scattering snows , gives place anon
Of the marriage chamber fast was made the door .
And who wants to swallow a mouthful of sorrow ?
The loves that hurt , the fate that blent
To reach the distant skies , and triumph there
Moons waxed to fullness and to sickles waned .
O’er the three worlds his empire held .
Where shady apennine lifts up the ridge
Where that old meadow of battle smiles away
Nor seek to change by going to pot . "
Now is come a darker day ,
And happiness too swiftly flies ?
So heavenly flutes made murmurous plain
Surely can they never find better time to fight .
Swift ocean cuts her boundaries from the shores
Gathering her brows like gathering storm ,
The village preacher 's modest mansion rose .
To tyrants he comes of a vengeance divine .
Were in some part neglected and made void . "
To follow thee fate gives me now the power :
And hear what the glad bells say !
That come from lips unseen , in sunlit room .
With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire ;
The future tenour will to thee unfold . "
And warriors there conflicted furious most .
Havoc will reign when next the sun shall rise .
The kingly rank and power i held
Till washington 's avenging time had come ;
But all the money went here in the end ?
Dissolving into a new abyss , and saw
Domestics , by ulysses gained for me .
To glory give the space thou hast to stay ;
He bids the train in long procession go ,
As it snuffs at the fresh flowing fountain ;
Which walking this gold morn i see ,
At early nightfall cleave the air serene ,
And poured the hissing tide :
The holy hermit raised his eyes ,
And virtue shines in all her native light ,
In every horror doomed to bear its part ! --
Shall follow from his lone retreat ,
Yet still beyond them all the stars still lie .
There the sure suns of these pale shadows move ;
What more did pass between these friends ,
And shadowy cross was cast
By pouring balm into the wounded heart ;
In smiles she sunk her grief to lessen mine .
The breezes their own languor lent ;
He crawls and makes a path of gore .
That arched a reef of surf like snow
I find its favours shamefully misplaced ;
The beast whose hundred eyes devour the door .
" hold your peace ! " some one replied ,
A mist came over the bay
Crest of battle sunward tossed ,
And muddy made the silvery water . "
And give it honest joan .
To which previous reference has been made .
A swift , a terrible bugle pealed .
His shoulders to the weight , alone , applied ;
And pious , would-be murder led the van
Each bore a blessing back to home .
And far as human eye can reach
Straight a short thunder breaks the frozen sky :
Is center , yet extends to all , so thou
Who charged with deeds my skill and scope ? "
To get the stomach-ache ?
't is like the lantern 's dripping light ,
He fell , and life was almost fled .
One blow only stood his sire ,
The way the fires broke out .
To lay his outlawed head . '
Of a tree that swept the skies
The ages come and go ,
In every heart that gives them room ,
That was bliss to make my sorrows flee !
The haws hung slips of fire ;
The murmur of whose mighty coil goes up
Till the abbey rang with the dismal tune .
Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal 'd .
And he spoke the words which follow :
His radiant arms triumphant meges bore .
At length with viśvámitra came
When thoughts that wear the hues of heaven
Louder still that voice is calling ;
To waft its adorations . by the cross ,
In wondrous light that shone afar ,
Smoothed every brow , and opened every soul :
Perhaps , when day is breaking ;
And earnest thoughts within me rise ,
Took its flight from this world .
The fern-tree lifted its drooping head
Only earth 's charity can make brave cortez great .
When daylight came , he entered not the camp
Which shall prevail -- the angel or the man ?
My shroud of white , stuck all with yew ,
For she is lost or breathes no more ,
So flowers shall rise in purple light array 'd ,
Her whole face lit as by an inward flame
Squandered my soul and gained her idle hate .
Drew nearer , how our downward course we wound .
What offerings bring , what treasures lay before thee ;
Within the crystal , which records the name ,
And the hot tears break and burn ,
That smile when she treads on them :
And find the light whence light begun ,
Hast thou a star to guide thy path ,
From paths where hide the lures of greed
Upon whose breast white sails arise
Unwearied and unchanged , goes sounding on .
Thoughts fresh as flowers that fill the mountain dell
I shall yet my vengeance see .
Sealed up unto another birth ;
Do you dream some day to fill the sea ?
They are lost in life 's dead sea .
The stars had fled . not one remain 'd behind
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow ,
Where sickness sweeps whole regiments to the grave ;
Who makes you perceive the supreme spirit wherever the mind
Here , while laid open to believing hand ,
And deem my loss too bitter to be borne ,
The hand that lays laurels before her ?
Had found its new birth in a bird . "
For the light of repentance bursting in ,
Has made the vision of his mind obscure .
Cast thy trinkets to the children ,
A cloud of spirits has gathered about him .
Love was not felt till noble heart beat high ,
But here or there as strikes the player goes ;
Encouraged him to frankly speak his mind .
Fast shall his fingers fly o'er the strings ;
May warble sweeter strains
And he spoke the words which follow :
That outward scorn showed store of grace within :
The waters rose more high , more high ,
Day after to-morrow brings its message ,
Unheeding , bent on life to come .
Sunward the restless races climb ! --
Adown his cheek a tear unbidden stole ;
Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice ,
For a fear that has come to me . ”
Sudden thrills through my pulses sent .
Shoot out in branches , or renew the birth :
Makes me powerful over others . "
Our glorious sire the skies has won .
And poplars black and white his temples bind .
Black smoke rising to the heavens
It says to me : " how sad and slow
Courage , comrade , spring will come again !
There 's not a bonie flower that springs ,
Backward on life that rises , where he rose
Not lightly is a king made wise ;
Into the busy world to seek his fate ,
And tempered with delight ,
And kissed with silent kisses mixed with tears ,
Places which pale passion loves !
Thence , with their riches charged the adventurers go
And the song this shape suggested
Such mixture was not held a stain :
The prayers that fill this prison , and the songs
The eager hands stretched out to clutch the prize ,
Our fancies hang grey and uncurled
Juan was moved ; he had made up his mind
My heart glows lighted as by fires of hell .
While it told of the faithful-hearted .
Small amends are these you 've gotten ,
He gave the baron a resounding kiss .
And all that fills the hearts of friends ,
Nor fields that stretch beyond the lane ;
To fair st. andrews bound ,
And hell was fashioned by the hearts that hated .
The hand that held the steel :
And their day goes over in idleness ,
Cheek lies heavy as a rose
For flowers and fruit of love to form ,
Win the cold heart of that stern deity ?
Unless he lashed her to an awkward rage --
The ninth hour came . the noble scyldings
They set the old echoes calling :
While all about the sleepers lay , like stones
My blood flowed on the sand for thee :
The cold old crimes and the deeds thrown by ,
And think to ruin where it seemed to praise .
O'erwhelming sorrow now demands my song :
And set two men , the sons of belial ,
And kept the country-side in fear ) .
As my thread of life is spun ;
Of wizardry , had wrought destruction here ;
All my heart is buried with you ,
Let love melt into memory and pain into songs .
Sugríva , to the fight addressed ,
The woundless and invisible thought that goes
Give pleasure in the grave .
White waves break tether ,
Within the soul that makes it yearn to soar
It cometh into court and pleads the cause
When half-repentance but makes evil whole ,
Cold are its ashes whence the breath is fled ,
Of those who carried terror through the land ,
To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon .
That gentleness to which belongs
Each bound the other 's crucifix ,
And i am left without him and alone . "
Mightier his anguish grows ,
And dead true poets flashed with scorn
" on her cold dead bosom my portrait lies ,
The hermit ’s purpose failed to break :
Sweeter the breeze my love 's breath brings !
No diamond pure was hers the right to bear ,
Or led by reasoning pride afar to roam ,
Such is the life they lead ,
Janak and ancient saints reached blessedness !
His plot conducting by the rules of art :
You marshal all your force to tire me out ,
Phrases used which do n’t imply
To lap the surface of the dark cool wave ,
That every mortals crimes display ;
The fearful sights it has seen .
To save the offence of charitable , flour
A stream glides in peace at the door --
And three times the virtues of brandy confess 'd ;
And god with heavenly food thy life renew ,
And stir the genial current of his soul .
By taking owen for her spouse .
Of rigid manners in the house remain ;
The hour of rest is gone ,
For now i take a road whose harsh alarms
With joy to feel how noontide flowed
His bull cheeks puffed , his bull lips blowing ,
" of the emerald table called forth gold at will
But give to me the snoring breeze
Shouts of applause re-echoed through the hall ,
He took such cognizance of men and things ,
I added ( as a trifling jest ) ,
These hirelings they 'll never stand ,
Into her heart thou hast poured it gushing :
To whom all eyes are turned in expectation .
And in the noon-time shadows lie .
And drew his magic from those cold clear springs .
Is the last i shall tread of american land .
When bedtime hour comes duly --
Of comforts , which thou hast in keeping !
The terms offered by the king rejected by gama
Dark to interpret ; but at last there came
Took the command , and bravely led them on .
Settled a gentle cloud of melancholy ;
And numbers more his lance had plunged to hell ,
Tell thee all that in my heart lies hidden .
Stocks and subscriptions pour on every side ,
Not a soul to share her fate ;
Nor earth my tread where trampling years have stood .
And life has fired , and death not shaded ,
Come forth pure saints , all justified and clear .
The amrit from their sight conveyed .
Which both preserved his life and gave him birth .
Unarmed , faced danger with a heart of trust ?
Circles and flows the restless human tide .
Beheld the hosts in fight , which hotly raged .
And take my chance with socrates for bliss ,
He won the trade , his name was made ;
O'er mine own element my course i take --
The hills untied their bonnets ,
With everlasting oil to give due light
To tread the ways of danger ?
Love is a bubble blown with air ;
The first faint dawn was flushing up the skies
And would feel the fingers of the wind
For arrogance noted ; to his memory
To track our hero on his path of fame :
On him the rays of morning fell
Disdain sits on his lips ; and in a frown
Rock and forest piled to heaven ,
Blessed is the god who gave him that bliss !
She takes the magic chain .
Parched the flowers they bear along .
And war and hatred joined to decimate
To life again their dying lord to bring ,
When i know how atonement may be made ,
I will leave my heart to love you ,
They spread their canvas , and their anchors weigh .
His godlike bounty flows for all mankind ;
And blessings o'er the land are spread .
Protects her , and her courage hath revived .
Why mute the pipe 's enlivening note ?
Each lip in vain the trembling accent tries ;
Within vast shores its strife makes desolate ,
Driven by the whirlwind : lighted by her beams ,
The turning wheel before the palace stays .
Ere even that seal can reach mine eye .
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong ,
As if exalting him they raised themselves .
A threatening cloud hung in the west .
That lent my knee desire to kneel , and shook
Answered in the words which follow :
The well in abject terror fled ,
Perchance new burdens i may bear
Dispel this cloud , the light of heaven restore ;
Joy and praise attend thee ,
Another vision follows this : in france
According to old form we see , --
Glory doth follow , courage goes before ;
Give life to this dead wood ,
And came into my mind this act of heaven ,
Was life till her sweet soul came --
Who in each battle give the onset would ,
The yellow leaves begin to fade
The lazy hours move slow
From sin and suffering came ,
To pass the winter .
Where thy dances , mixed with game ?
Struggles and frees itself to find the sky .
Will yield small credence to the tale i tell .
That winds sang through in mournful gushes ,
One bed that night shall hold you both . "
Making life seem a glorious trance ,
That brings me to the lips of my desire .
Again before me lies the street ,
The wrecks will follow too .
Each year we bandy gifts , and follow out
The others all in flight their safety found .
Various other examples of watch-case verses follow :
No more the groves shall answer to my song ,
And made the gaudy moth forget its pride ,
To find his lady 's eye ,
And boughs , and leaves and lighted brands they cast
But there was left my heart with her .
Our song and feast shall flow ,
Wafted to heaven , and mingling with the sighs
Crapulous hands reach out to strangle thee ,
Strewn on the surface of that silent sea
Grant us to draw our scattered fleet ashore ,
And there was one that followed her
And the sightless hides its face .
When all but they were in a tempest lost ,
And his soul communes and takes cheer
Wilt thou , lord , stand for me ?
Would bring the marvel of a book sublime ,
Where the wind flowers blow !
By fate and death ’s dread coils enwound ,
It wavers to a rose .
Its colours ; gently has he laid
The fury smothering in its throat ; -- then fell
In leading his harrogate flock the right way .
And oft ulysses smoking victims laid .
By foreign hands thy decent limbs composed . "
Dully on days that go past .
The pleasant shores that round girgenti lay .
Corrects your morals , and all tastes shall fit ,
Making the darkness deeper where hides the nightingale .
So distant from its shadow chased below .
And leafy trees will go .
Which sent a spirit marred and stained ,
Nor long will his love stay behind him .
Victory crowns the just .
This is his story as i gathered it ;
No voice ; but oh ! the silence sank
Called on the clans to rise .
Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise
Nothing 's added to the stock :
But nothing comes from nothing ; none
That marks the alternate ebb of shade and shine ,
To match the gods in beauty ; take thy bow
To guide thee nobly through this pilgrim world !
Along the arch in choral song are rolled .
Fill my fond heart with god alone , for he
It pierced , with direst fury sped ,
And when she turned from these fair dreams ,
A duller sense than mine should feel
When wintry winds begin to blow !
A pensive calm reigned on his noble brow ,
Still raise for good the supplicating voice ,
From hope , the wretched 's anchor , torn ,
And veer the prow from northern snows afar ,
The threatening clouds that sail along the sky .
With reverent welcome round him pressed .
No backward glance gives progress . upward ! on !
And ranked plagues their numbers tell ,
But if that flower with base infection meet ,
We waited there while the wind moaned past
What horrors unceasing revolved though my breast ,
Make service noble , and the earth redeem
And many a caution aged nestor gave ,
We roll the rock of business up , and see
With lighted matches waving . now , once more ,
Beautiful shoulders are those that bear
Who came to make men free ,
In the soothing thoughts that spring
So saying , to his assembly back he drew :
It put three fingers out of joint ,
A mighty river roars between ,
It drinks heaven 's dew as blithe as rose
The soul of man , i tried to show ,
That at her flowery work doth sing ,
Love , with gladness meet my prayer ,
Mystical , curiously graven and set .
The waiting army lay encamped , before
Neptune in human form conceal ’d his aid .
Unshaken ! nor yet staid the terror there :
Tell them england hath taken me !
And thus thick darkness , overspread the church
Who fell asleep a hundred years ago .
Only made the rivets stronger .
Long lost happiness restore ,
Her mural breach , returning whence it rolled .
Set to the north wind like a sail .
To make short intervals of separation .
In every eye a pious fervor flashed ;
" to-morrow brings her bridal day ;
I follow ; yet how distant be my doom
The same mild season gives the blooms to blow ,
Many are seen to ply the festive dance ;
That sullen clouds were gathering in the skies
I filled you with delight , when close embraced ;
The scented manuscript must close .
We held a being less akin
Though mountains stood in silence to defy me ,
Ring out the feud of rich and poor ,
Her hands the fatal cup supplied —
And the sea rises higher . "
Something told us there was fear ,
That even lesser lips are moved to sing
Far-called our navies melt away --
The news it was brought to king louis ;
So does my heart its altar seek in thine ,
They made their way with vigorous force ,
And all life 's opposites are gathered there
With sympathy large enough to enfold
Christ took our nature on him , not that he
My naked breast , and shot along the tide .
And of one that came from the living god ,
And to my heart such kindly courage ran ,
What shall divide ? the god within the mind .
Or pinnacle that sought the sky ,
Had crowded out my hopes of holiness .
My weary footsteps go ?
Where paradise leaned over iran 's plain ,
Many thoughts of trouble come ,
That sees what my love hath seen ? --
Slowly the dawn light faded from her face
When from their dusty life they pass ,
How it came , or whence it grew ,
Made several seek to be baptized anew .
With better gifts than the old year gave ;
Melted , and fortunes seemed to disappear ;
When the twilight turned to darkness ,
In the solemn shades of the wood that swept
That colored her wonderful eyes . and her grace
And sees the law its work pursue .
How much is said that tends to help
The deep and ancient night , which threw its shroud
( _ we lay our story in the east .
The blow that sent me here
Nothing gloomy shall be taken
Last year came out our daughter dell ,
This doctrine i count right cruel and hard ,
From love bowed weeping in a thorny place --
He saw the wreck his rashness wrought ;
As much as woman 's breath will bear and live
The tears steal down my cheek ,
But next day passed , and next day yet ,
Who placed the houses both here and yonder ,
Are echoes through a thousand labyrinths flown ;
Perhaps the soul thus springing to fill its grave ,
Where round you love and joy for ever shine .
Where vikrit holds the second place ,
Even purer than before , -- as perfumes rise
And weeping she took for her lover
My life had found her maiden-wise ,
The candle shed a feeble ray , ----
Each grudging master keeps the labourer bare --
That finds a chord in every breast
Of traitors -- who their country sold .
With twitching hands and feet that drag ,
With gray walls compassed round ,
Your truth and valor wearing ;
But upon those that love such fear sits well .
Newly arisen , he also sprang to rise ,
But follow the joys that have flown ;
That gleaming gem , and gladly to note
I feel the strength of your fervent arms ,
And thy heart-strings thrill wildly
As the storm-winds ply the bellows .
Where the swallows build the summer through ;
A sinful heart makes feeble hand . "
Could not lift food to my hungry mouth ,
And hope to see thee gives me life again .
And as the answer came ,
The first , first woe my spirit knew ,
Her face is bathed in lovelier light
Till that dire cause , which spreads the livid hue
Passion and party . courage may be shown
Feeling the young gold morning , fresh and clear ,
Hence strife shall rise , and mortal war succeed ;
When the frost paints lying flowers ,
New , unknown chords of melody awoke
This twain that gives me happiness !
Where i their shadows might as well have shown ?
Where the blood-stained fields lie bare ,
Its anguish stayed where i did .
A liquid chord is every wave that flows ,
To make for them melodious due .
But i read the truth of your noble heart
And in thy trembling hands that water take . "
Its pleading touch would seek to thee enfold !
Of sudden passion bursting . all was still ;
The present hour to join the past .
Yet take no atom of its space .
And through the square his way he took ;
To grasp the truth . then i remembered all --
Aristocratic as was ever seen ,
The roses fortune gave them :
That love should spring from sympathy .
Hoping in tears to vent its misery :
At his first blow each vain defense must fall ,
But still as wilder blew the wind ,
While buddy wears a smile .
One could not allay his thirst ;
But i took the hind to my embrace ,
Brave news is carried ;
In changeless angles fixed and bound ,
She yet can raise the crowned , yet civic brow
" time had gone but little distance ,
And their most righteous customs made me scorn
It sees through tears how christ loved us ,
Through the walls a breach had made ,
Had stronger fear not chilled even hate ; --
His mother with these words addressed :
The fleet which him to africa might bear ;
She swept past in her gentleness again ,
But if that flower with base infection meet ,
Wasting the wealth we never can recall ,
Joy is known , ranked around music ,
Christ 's pity could not lightly scan :
But or ere that day 's moon came again
Evora 's frowning walls now shake with fear ,
Than when his way lies among flowers .
Whom i have set there in that lofty home :
Blind gods that can not spare .
Thy magi , to decipher what it means .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Of weary feet that have left the road and strayed
And the soothed heart with secret pleasure fills .
In many an orbit wheels , then lighting sits
So the talk passes as the train descends
That strove to sing with voices drowned in tears .
To what low depths the pirate press will go .
A little over us his station took .
To make the flame go higher .
By casting pebbles in its tide ,
I in this territory caught a bliss " ?
Whenever nature gave it as a form .
I take him perfected ; for whose one sake
Have we felt as if virtue forbid it ? --
The raging god prepares t ' avenge her fate .
Thus went on speaking
For us he bears the sultry day ,
Had wrought this triple wrong .
Of hard misfortune , carved in it with tears .
The path that leads thereto who never struck ,
We two went on together ,
That grew a flame
By love 's quick motion find a way
Then aged nestor rose , and thus began :
More light absorbed , more moral might evolved .
This very day , now a year is run .
Jack finds his wife a perfect beauty .
From falling into such an evil deed .
A soothing murmur the lone region fills ,
Which overcomes us gazing .
Each painful moment as it flies ?
The candles flickered and leapt ,
Till he came where the column of moonshine lay ,
And deal a wound that lingers ;
Murmuring the prayer the patriarch breathed of old , --
Till the darkness falls around us ,
A dauntless spirit thou hast shown .
Spring has a rushing sound , and summer sends
The hand of charity extends
To such a one has ever given birth .
Give men and women freedom , save the land
A single field which i have looked upon ,
Time shall set free the flower .
No more , beat westward , even as all mankind
Their souls were drifting as the sea ,
For deep the sorrows that o'er many hung .
She 's lost its fellow , so golden yellow ,
The night 's long hours still find me thinking
Swagger of roderick , heading his clan --
And made her giddy till she signed the cross --
Abruptly , as it came , the charm was past
Where the great wall round china goes ,
Its memories will follow wherever we go ,
With burning grief he marked the few
The painters have fashioned their tales of delight ;
That the little mascot might stick and live .
Hard upon ether came the origins
Thy youthful form in earth 's cold bosom lies .
Where woods and streams with soft and pausing winds
His earnest supplication made ;
And fall , and then comes winter . "
Nor yet the crowded fleet its anchor stirred .
Though drunken with the flags that sway
That gathers thunder of infinite ululations .
This knyght made noble chere ,
Meantime return 'd , with dire remorseless sway ,
But laid on him he would the office shame ,
And dreamier grew the maiden 's watching eyes ,
Our way we held , more rugged than before ,
When the red curtain spread its falling screen ;
My nerves partake of its elastic spring ;
Your woman 's tact and aid were drawn
Which would not let your spirit rest .
The life too wrecked for man to mend .
Will come to be a scandal to his folks ;
Fain would he make the world his pedestal ;
Had wrought the wonder of the land
A countenance in which did meet
Soft minyas rolls his waters to the main :
Hope scarcely beams on life again .
Where the influence reaches , and where it will end
Whose dragon eyes shone bright with anger 's spark ,
Now it has come to say good-by ?
That shines through thy lips when they part ,
Truth i revere ; for wisdom never lies . '
Some scene of bliss gone by ; --
The waters murmured so low and sweet ,
Along the line this signal ran , --
Religion lay the way she went ;
Puts to rest the wisdom-hero ,
Or say with princes if it shall go well
Her outward consciousness . her brain was fused
I have made the arm of the driver fail ,
Joyfully he sought the conflict ,
They came in beauty , side by side ,
And we took the chance they gave
Thine earth now springs , mine fadeth ;
The silence broke ; then with her bended knee
Thy thyrse and bite the bays .
That turns to ridicule the turgid speech
Gilding the net wherein his soul was caught
Life takes me in black coils .
And uncomplaining snows -- which make no sign ,
The task of small professors to invent ;
My soul what its lips would spell too --
Pounding the saddles as they rose and sank ,
That brought the fog and mist .
That my bosom holds in capture ,
Commerce , convenience , change might strongly draw .
Take heed , that in thy verse
And shed a bitter tear .
Peace to this gloomy grove that sees me acting
Who can command the gamut of despair ;
Despair hangs in the broken folds of my garments ;
Which with its waters binds the crumbling soil .
To tell the dark discoveries of the greeks ,
You seize the flower , its bloom is shed ;
He left them to the fates , in bloody fray
There left the paper signed by richard wain ,
Whene’er the breeze of morning blew ,
Throbs of anguish in the crushing cell ,
Those leaves , which autumn had blown off before ;
If linked with mirth .
But old establish 'd custom ? what religion
Where purgatory its true beginning takes . "
They poured sadness to the brim ;
How proud the poet 's billow swells !
" her novice days went on ; much sickness fell
And pulses of vague quiet went and came .
As her young thoughts would have it come .
And the trees took hold of me ,
Should join our hands to pray to thee ?
Thankful that none with me its sufferings share .
And still the smile that then the mother wore
Which makes him -- clean back of the power
Be turned to mourning ? --
That death left lonely in the nest ;
Theirs be the arm that crushes sin ,
He sought his kinsman cato 's humble home .
Those eyes that mirrored all eternity ,
Through the bright shield the sturdy weapon drove ,
The lady took some comfort , and laid by ,
His glory quenched all spite , all envy killed :
Shall shed a peacefulness around ,
And arthur started as the accents broke ; --
In every conflict may we put them to flight ,
That they unfold their histories ,
The swallow goes south with you : i go west
And left him blank beneath the freeman 's whip
The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke :
There came a day at summer 's full
The second said : " i have found a knight
Of the milestones you must pass ?
He brought our nation free of bondage .
To brandimart orlando gave the steed :
Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows ;
Then , once more drawn together , cheerful talk
Lost love went weeping half a winter 's day .
" _ how shall these find grace
Leaving a nameless sense that lingers
Waxes in rage and threat the tempest fell .
In many an orbit wheels , then lighting sits
Sent the sad sire in solitude to stray ;
And cool winds whispered of the autumn near .
Thus the weeping boat made answer :
The nymph ... that never comes to me !
Which never felt the cold of frost and snow ,
Next came the warrior three . of glory 's charms
To doubtful conflict , certain slaughter bring :
Then came that glorious day at last
Had not the rocket , raising cain ,
For whom glad days have ever yet to run ,
Where groan 'd the field of battle ,
Had the roused tiger met the pardon 'd foe !
So , to it they went ,
The exchange , where old insurers run ,
And all the wee stars came tumbling through .
I 've lived in pleasure mixed with grief ,
No answer could the astonished mother make ;
Thy presence , lord , fills every place ;
And froze the genial current of the soul .
They 'd lead a pleasant , peaceful life .
Came here to close his vulture 's feast .
A wave to pant beneath thy power , and share
That night they slept and took their rest ;
Nor having power to make him stint his lore ,
Funereal forms in long procession rose .
The sun is risen ; yet darkness lies ,
Lightning retreated .
To lay one on the path of this
The falling fire to tend .
Young nuns , whose chief religion lay
Another , with her maidens , drawing off
The carriage held but just ourselves
Like sobbing waves that roll up from the sea ?
Who brightened these eyes for the prey they seek ?
The birds make glad the forest trees ?
To stem the deluges of war ,
Because his stock will not hold out for white .
The leaves dance round her with delight ,
Sport in the shadows cast from melancholy .
Yet evil whence ? in thee can harbour none ,
And set sugríva on the throne .
And the shadow that he cast
Obscure they went thro ' dreary shades , that led
Bravely still your sorrows bear --
And after followed whither pleased the maid ,
Take liberties with royal names again .
Shall i take comfort ? dost thou live
And hector first came towering to the war .
Yet why should i this cruel theme pursue !
Thy race has ceased to reign ,
From hell continued , reaching th ' utmost orb
The ancient threat of deserts where there sprang
While all the cyclic heavens about me spun .
Thorough the fog it came ;
Answered in the words which follow :
Where yon broad water sweetly slowly glides .
She trod the poppies . hours passed
There lies the great ocean of song .
To wring from out thy soul a cry
Moves in the blowing odours where they pass ,
So shimmering-sweet and palpitant , it shone
These sounds upon the night breeze caught --
Trees bend down their gnarled boughs ,
Which neither feels nor fears .
Thy mournful eyes , where’er they turn ,
Whose love and truth protect them well .
With varying impulse divided and torn ,
So upon every side the sinners stood ;
Then , helpless , shall i call to mind
My heart is weary , my peace is gone ,
Struck by a nameless fear that leapt along
The little path that leads to home ,
That soliform made featureless beside
Arose , with grief inscribed , a mournful flower .
Nothing went right . the champion cut
Where precious moments came at break of day ,
A spring goes singing through its reedy grass ;
They find it so easy to cancel the wages ,
How this poor heart to his own was knit .
The goods committed into fortune 's hands ,
Dissolving as the dew melts in the sun .
Till thou peelest me the sandstone ,
While the moon and stars their vigils keep .
Know thou that nature fashioned this fire
But alas ! came a day when the shepherd forgot
On other gods his dreadful arm employ ,
That makes such haste to melt and die ,
I feel the bliss i do not tell .
Who with his shanks was making such lament .
Above the place where central battle burned
Of me those happy spirits were fixed , each one
" the jealous love you bring to me ,
The sweetness of love 's kisses can not lave ,
And loud their shouts of joy will ring ;
The object of her joy will bring .
To frame the code which life secures ,
God with thee be , or i shall see
He forms a scene beyond elysium blest --
His mistress ' portrait decked the wall ,
For we knew our time had come at last .
From virgin voices floats the choral song .
Well : here at morn they 'll light on one
Of that excess made to the face a nose ,
From whom th ' austere etrurian virtue rose ;
So went , the exiled pair
I am all that ever went with evening dress !
Thus at last the eagle catches
The addition of his empire , how it showed
Meantime commit we to our women 's care
Thus on retreating greece the trojans pour ,
't is grafted on eternity ;
And soon they went by tens and twelves
( his gown discharged , his money spent ,
To struggle with her sorrow all alone ,
I count my health my greatest wealth ,
And bleeding hearts a melancholy pleasure find .
That golfing of field sports stands foremost in fame .
With brooding fulness awes and hushes everything .
Shall execute due vengeance on thy foes ;
But one deduction , and it came next day .
Which whirling ran around so rapidly ,
And feigning doubt , in hesitation holds ,
In comes the playmate that never was seen .
Draws like prometheus from the heavenly hearth
But tell of days in goodness spent ,
Unbroken glory , a gathered radiance ,
And step for step they followed dancing ,
When the moon is drifting overhead ,
The pollacks came with rushing haste ,
That only serves to make us grieve ,
Headlong , impetuous , see it pour ;
But like some dying friend withdrew .
Who is the angel that cometh ?
Is a subject on which i could dwell ;
" and called on god for rain .
Then rose a yell of baffled hate , and sprang
Ceases not to ply his hammer ,
And called their bids across the market-place .
Into the mighty law that governs yet .
All that such dreams may mean .
And men leave blood where their feet have stood
The soul in dalliance laid , the spirit
The savage war-club swung :
And radiating cheer .
But the years , that take the best away ,
And tarquin 's eye may read the mot afar ,
Of years like red leaves buried in snow .
The other held a fair rose over-blown ;
Love makes us blind and selfish ; otherwise
Will make a purse five pounds a side . '
Till they -- fall asleep .
His faith was painted on his face ,
To think , if his house take fire ,
The inborn angel 's features drew !
Must wander thirty-fold for all the time
And curse the land which dire ulysses bore .
This freedom took to jeer thy courtesy .
Where doomed genius lay ,
He leap 'd amid a murderous band ,
With crests laid horizontal on their backs .
As manhood 's sterner age was neared ;
Where woods went down to hereford ,
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured ,
Just as the artist caught her , --
Loud was the roar the lions gave .
Look thou my steps pursue : the margins give
The brilliant beam bore these letters
Pierced through the gloomy , cypress-shaded night .
O even wings of music , bear my soul !
Say what strange motive , goddess ! could compel
To cloud celestially sown ,
Which the moat covers , where is paid the fee
O king , whose subjects felt your fire ,
It made the children laugh and play ,
Rude presents that fortune had made him ,
And scampered as fast as his strength would allow :
They hold the look whose tenderness condoles
And tears that follow after ;
That changed us into soldiers ; swing your bells
" for that the spirit of evil comes ,
That race subdued , who filled the world with slain
And from the dark west a new wind arose ,
( such doom the fates assign us ) ;
Kindness turns a pain to pleasure ,
That makes the universe resemble god .
But god like a wind goes breathing
Lest back the awful door should spring ,
The milk rushed faster to her breast ;
Four years ! -- and didst thou stay above
Where fountains of sweet water ran , and round
And big fire-engines rushed and rattled by ,
There the foul , earliest reptile spectra lay ,
While angels make each of its subjects their care ,
Where the fishing fleets put in ,
And in matiers that they delite also
A bitter sigh i drew , then scarce found voice
They laid the loved and lost away ;
To the polar blizzards tossed ;
Ere it spreads to hills and hollows
For grave deceivers lodge their labours here ,
Fate now allows us ,
That strikes soul into marble , could but seize
That rings her brow with heavenly flame .
That lay in the house that jack built .
He thinks a loaf will rise to fifty pound .
And step for step they followed dancing ,
Not all the sea his fire can quench .
I think because more with its truth imbued .
Our inmost thoughts will stand confest .
Homeward bound ? we , born of venice ,
And freedom 's fame finds wings on every wind .
Hard run , he feels his strength decay ,
Or transmigration , as their lot shall lead .
His nerveless hand still grasped the sword .
And , like baptism , held the flying wretch --
Trying to face death .
Meseems that he an ill exchange hath made ;
The lord of lanká made reply :
Nor yet their silence broke :
The broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears ,
If east , the trees will bear much fruit ;
The first heat was soon set a-going ;
Such a look as here was shown
The sexes sprung from shame and pride ,
Water the grave where hope lies slain .
And with such hope and glory fill it ,
Fighting alone , worn to the bone ,
Wish i could , with fury raging ,
Old joys reviv 'd once more i feel ,
And throws the lover on the lover 's gaze :
Where they want of riches find ,
Not vainly planted in the unsteady mind ;
Sweet stream , that winds through yonder glade ,
Fantastic gables , crowding , stared : but she
Swims in their eyes that almost melt to tears .
Whose pencil gave and heighten 'd graces ,
Unteaching all his virtuous nature taught ,
Now to true reason give thy mind for us .
Deep in a cave the sibyl makes abode ;
" thou hast found the best of husbands ,
Authority usurped , from god not given :
Of honour , where no honour can be gained :
With glad songs come to abdicate
We 'll give our souls the wing ,
And see where the pretty moon goes .
As the swift seasons roll !
Fierce eurus from the deep sea dashed ashore
So draw him home to those that mourn
Would not have cooled one whit her boiling blood .
In vacation time it stops !
But know their rights , and knowing dare maintain .
That said : o tears are vain ! --
Kabul town 'll go to hell --
The holy satan , who made the wives
That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart ;
Water will find its level , fire will burn ,
And stand a barrier to eternity .
Set in that smile . -- she turns away .
The true and right thou canst not find ,
Till he has run his race .
As flowers absorb the rays that they receive .
Where april shadows flit
Jealousies kept him irked abroad , controlled
Where brown leaves fall , where drifts lie deep
All our pleasures belong .
A coming battle against him waged .
Which lies before the feet , thro ' common ways
Of aventine spread oft a lake of blood .
His body flung the rein , and urged their speed
A storm of mighty billows broke and passed .
And spread themselves through all the space of heaven
Boy scouts camping went .
An empress lays her votive wreath
Where the stream begins to leap .
His idol-cricket there is set :
The golden clime , that gave thee birth ;
That saw the red-coats marching by ;
And time can heal the saddest hurts of love .
Its flickering crown of snows that flash and toss
Till it rise and remain and take station
That shook the light stems of that flowery close ,
They were so far gone in love 's histories ,
And the shadow seemed to trail ,
The vital lamp , and swells the genial seeds :
As one who in new matters makes essay .
On went the pair , until they reached the bound
For i know allah will not take offence ;
Showing with hissing wings the joy she feels .
We found the greeks less formidable foes ,
Well , my heart gave out .
Each happy shade transported roves !
Three captains went to indian wars ,
Circle our island on the breezes borne ;
And fills an empty world with thoughts of you .
The dust will gather on all my harmonies ;
Dear soul , who found earth sweet ,
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
That shook their seeds round thee on earth .
And bore each strain of triumph from the sky ;
And felt the woes of miserable man .
Though she drank bitter herbs to kill the curse ,
To shades where cooling waters run .
Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge .
He pity gave ere charity began .
Your fame to men that breathe a distant air ;
" land beloved , oh , fare thee well !
How comes it thus ? unfold , celestial guide ,
And when the hour of sleep its quiet brings ,
There came none near nigh the mark
With hands fate makes me lift up in despair ,
And make each relic and persue his search ?
A sun that slopes in amber air , --
How they ring out their delight !
Never fell to monarch of france the like . "
Kabul town 'll go to hell --
And add unto their burning by their shame .
Let not your roof with echoing grief resound ,
Passed through the guarded gates and went its way .
Giving his benediction and embrace ,
But the timber brought us to grief at last ;
In gloomy dingles ; or to trace the tide
His night cap raised for very fear .
That i might see the cheerful peeping day .
Did symptoms of the dropsy tell ;
The twain together well might change the world .
The tide of flowing tears awhile suppress ;
Not forced to frame excuses for his birth ,
And the waves have spread
Heard her loud shrieks that rent the echoing wood ,
Must fade and wither in the tomb !
And with these words his temptation pursued : --
In the delight that work alone can give .
With vital power , ' the other made reply ,
Did round this globe their courses run .
Less put the spirit out , less baffle thirst
And the song this shape suggested
Here freedom cradled ; here its paean burst
The friends who leave us do not feel the sorrow
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
I scanned the works that keep their name .
For she who chased all our care away
To sable night the eastern sky resign 'd ,
And no salvation left in realms above .
There came a change -- the cloud rolled off ,
And a great darkness lay upon the sea ;
To the forest led the pathway ,
A majesty as if she trod the sea ,
Then we went to thinking mighty fast ,
Yet think not i the road i kept before
Bitter drops of anguish falling ,
He brought the news of litwa 's victories !
My throne to hers shall go ;
Their waste defeated hearts should move .
The bloom that lies on fanny 's cheek
Men shops shall take to hold their ware ;
Startled and stricken , awake and aware ?
A mighty shout rose from the spanish fleet .
The man makes jokes with careless smile ,
Memory alone can waken now its numbers .
The rigid interdiction , which resounds
Through roaring deserts of embattled death ,
Changeless change the law that runs
And given her a fatherly greeting .
Still clung to by the tattered mists of day
But found it still a pleasing care ,
Thus prepare a look for surety ,
As father fond art found ;
And when the summer came again ,
The flowery hill whereon they lay ,
Finds no relief , nor heavy eyes repose :
And left behind a smile which cheered
At noontide they flow
And he spoke the words which follow :
And cleared again her front and visage sad ,
“ misfortune ’s come too hard to bear ,
And its blest influence was known to lend .
Paths that lead a shelving course
Of losel snatches born of folly --
For youth goes over , the joys that fly ,
Who makes the good of all his care .
Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat ,
May gaze through these faint smokes curling whitely ,
Her lofty masts stood bending to the gale ,
Grave saints stole out to look at me ,
In thy dear self i find --
It stormed each throbbing pulse with blissful ache ;
Made promise of the way her sect enjoins .
A way to make the sugar lumps go round ;
This heart its pledges doth renew --
The stars are gliding like a lover
The gale follows fair abaft .
There springs a flower to kiss her feet .
Loaded with thanks and all that words could speak ,
Of daring health that leaps along the veins --
Had found her heart so deeply moved :
My cities which could break the pride of rome ,
To see the coming year :
Of which a double list fell on his breast .
January brings the snow ,
That will thoroughly change my mood ;
And there unfolds his majesty .
Then joined our years were thirty-three ,
What sounds come swelling , what notes fall dying
Where the wind comes blowing merry and chill ;
That brought me passionate to your lips :
From what once lovely lip it springs unseen !
His helmet now shall make a hive for bees ;
( ardent youth , reflect on that ! )
Under its icy spurting she was caught ,
As if she pray 'd that heaven would save
In vain ! for still the deadly calm endured .
That would not stir the violets on thy grave !
In hate , whose mining depths so intervene ,
And gold that lies behind the eyes ,
Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow ,
" thy labour finished , enter into rest ! "
Here is what sings unrestricted faith .
But he found it cold and lifeless ;
Came heavier trouble than the woes i share ,
Some singer to whom his heart inclined .
It will live in the heart of the nation ,
Reviewing , saw him hold the seat of power .
Passed by us , chased by a phantom hound
Not far from hence there stands a hilly town ,
May snatch a vengeance equal to his ire .
Because the old books show not ,
Gigantic flowers on creepers that embrace
For he and i in years gone by ,
Coming thro ' heaven like a light that grows
Friar paul , shouting and beating .
Devotedness that in the shadow stands
Should always find embarrassments .
The mighty baptist that way marks the line
Who fights to take our liberty away ,
Here of defeats to come and victories taught ,
To crest each rising thought with purity !
Nor look for mercy from the incessant surge
A very little made him mellow ;
That makes the world your foe !
That lack of means enforce you not to evil :
And there lay them safe and sound ;
Flush ’d with celestial blood pursued his way ,
Never a heart that was touched of god ,
These tokens shown true signs and witness be
From his dark eyes , too bright to bear ,
Where the tremulous shadows move soft and darkling ?
Can make known women torturingly fair ;
Not one moment will i waste ,
To meet her father 's will !
Constantly true , in full devotion fixed ,
Having failed to get credit in science or art ,
The 1788 version here adds this couplet :
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene
Well , christmas came all in its season ,
His jaws uplifting from their fell repast ,
From gods above no more compassion find ;
Until they claimed as winners , all
Wines fit for one in his position --
What secret dusty chamber was it hinting ?
We measure our love by thy loss ,
And grafted true-love on his heart .
A bird broke forth and sang ,
Of greater hope possesses , as is written
As though they held existence light .
Who strove a year and , sorely pressed ,
His answer to the hermit made :
Whereby the opened highways of belief
A holiness appealing to all hearts ;
Again they rush to arms ; in deeds of fight
Can lull the heart that knows too well
One , bold and hardened with her sinful life ,
The stranger 's side the young disciple drew ,
That met from lamorak 's an even shaft
And it sets an example as well .
Which forms its life and soul , it takes
All active love should take its way
That i used to take for a woman 's sake
Which filled my soul with such delight
And fit me for such fellowship with thee !
Can find its condonation , in that we
The day has held but pleasure and delight .
A rest that peace begets ;
The fair sun dropped ; then dashing ,
To nothing be recalled , doubt not my words ,
The light that loses , the night that wins ;
Precious stones were turned to healing
An ' hope unfolds her fairy scene ,
This went by
For honey that i bear away . '
On the sombre rafters , that round him made
Hearts were aching , hearts were breaking , lashes
" whence first arose the usage , which began
The emperor gave his pledges o'er .
That moat and high wall ran around .
The light is made of many dyes ,
And ere the leaves could urge their prayer ,
That fills our life ; as light mysterious
Seeing his love so gripped him , none the less
He went dreaming as though dull ,
When ahead a sharp curve comes in sight
My spirit , touched by mercy 's ray ,
( for surging souls , no worlds can bound ,
For bearing a just share of toil and strife .
To float in the regions where madness careers ,
Wisdom , though fled far away .
They rode , undaunted , through the spinning surf ;
And vengeance taken gave new cause of shame :
And rippling plains ' gin shiver with light gusts ;
Then he fell to bitter weeping ,
His noble heart went pit-a-pat ,
In his bosom gladness flowing .
Heard of litvanian speech . new feelings rose
And boiling depths of hell .
Or bounded only by a law whose force
And in their flesh had opened many a gate ,
From the hard season gaining ? time will run
His anxious thoughts to sítá sped ,
The shadows crouched and crept .
And a shout went round the board ,
She takes , and alone gives grace :
And the right shall rule the wrong ;
And makes the beautiful to be .
To catch dame fortune 's golden smile ,
For fame makes holy all its lightning rives .
Those lips whose tides of fragrance come and go
It watched the centuries come and go --
Only made from the breath of ukko .
Summer comes and winter goes ,
He 'd sparked it with full twenty gals ,
Fall circumvented thus by fraud , though join 'd
A mighty king i might discerne ,
Mayest thou seize the moment that passes happily !
Transported touch ; here passion first i felt ,
No thorns go as deep as a rose 's ,
And the song we took for a token
That never sailing on its waters saw
An odorous breeze came sweeping softly by .
In even balance holds the scales , to mete
When rebellion stirred the land ,
And takes the royal orders , -- lo ,
Fell famine marks the maddening throng .
Shall know the truth which maketh free ,
And luminous view to gain .
Unearthly was the hymn , which then arose .
I went as a wand ' ring scholar
With a true instinct , takes the golden prize
The hopeless sages backward turned :
Asylas . there in tumult swept along
My song of love could make her sad ,
Proof given of valour in all ages past .
We dropped the seed o'er hill and plain
Which on our farms and pleasant places fell .
I have been taught to look upon a publisher
Or never feel the rage , or never own ;
Can give , and what retract a grace ;
Other pathways lead to somewhere ,
New vows they find . " may mighty winds arise
A thousand ages have not made less bright
It means we shall no longer rule the province ;
The heart keeps its tough old persistency still ;
As the seasons come and go ,
Waters that whelm the body as they gleam
When tidings came that salisbury ,
The day passed on into night 's dark shade ;
To see the arrogance of atreus ' son ?
Come , see the wavering light expel the gloom
And the dusk to dark is turning , --
And the smoke is curling over the ricks .
This double science take , and gain
No ease , no pleasure my sad heart receives ,
With mental winter snowy head may fit .
There make new blood flow abundant ;
And wild impatience stared in ev'ry face .
New volumes came across the sea
That flows from flower to flower ;
Once more at the station the whiskey is spread .
The fate of a nation was riding that night ;
We have counted friend as foe ;
Certain enigmas penned in the hieroglyphs
My early childhood loved to hear .
For the first passion stays there such a while ,
To grave themes delicately drawn .
That broke against the leaning sky ;
The sad who find aught worth a sigh ,
Which by and by black night doth take away ,
A field of daises wandering in the wind
And make them glad !
Some respect for our intelligence was shown ;
When the childish faith is lost ?
The terms rejecting , the defenders mann 'd
Which he with truth could represent
The great tides come and go .
And to the greeks his winged words address 'd :
So , when his orders came to sail ,
By dead man 's thorn , while setting wires ,
They passed with their old-world legends --
Seasons revolved ; and saw the great achilles ,
And trail its good name in the gutter ;
With arms enfolded , and with swelling heart ,
O weary winter soon will pass ,
Tears filled his mild blue eye .
And all that saw hem sell ,
Again philistia 's triumph brought dismay ,
Now seeing truce and treaty broke , among
Where i have passed the happiest hours of youth --
In spring they lie one broad expanse of green ,
Of blankets to kick off at night ,
And life 's wheel too must go --
The ills and pains gold can not cure . '
And soft and sweet the changing waters grew .
That he had the pitchers yielding .
Come forth before the autumn goes ,
And there the heavenly vision comes no more ,
There in the hills grave silence lies ,
And tears of grief would only flow
That voice is round me like a bursting sea :
Your first and perfect form ye show ,
And cruelty directs the thickening blows ;
For grief sits with me in my cell ,
Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud ,
Of the sea-war closed o'er him :
With the first dream that comes with the first sleep
To feel that yours were empty years ;
Nor sorrow may attend thy name ?
The bellowing tribes brought on the savage war .
In trust took he john 's lands ;
As home draws near , to him appear
Who wouldst my heart and heartstrings tear ,
Nor feel thy soul by some sweet presence awed ?
But from their waning throng a whisper stole ,
Shall feel the hope , within his bosom dying ,
The gallop led ; the red-coats scattered ,
The dimpling drops around had spread .
By fresh airs blown , drifted into sleep ;
A travesty of man , ye go :
The little finger o'er the point has passed !
Where pity 's tender tribute flows ,
His own fair hyacinthus lay .
Then came the vision of unrest --
But spirit 's spirit in the trailing mist .
May more of men and manners see . )
There hangs a pale blue evening sky ,
He that doth paint the beauties of your verse ,
Should he show unlooked for weakness ,
The night came on alone , --
Yet feared he , and recoiled a little space .
And every leaf should fold its flower .
The angel of the cross roads lead me out ,
With ocean ’s boundless waters vied .
Whereto the soul the highest thoughts have spoken ,
That gave it birth , and kept it warm .
Thy peerless beauty yet shall fade .
Or god and nature meant to mere mankind ,
Whom the lord calls unto himself in peace !
The deck approaching , shakes a flaming brand ;
In sudden light they shone and heavenly harmony .
My soul , disdainful and disgusted , sought
That danced down shades the scarlet dance profane ;
When awful truth unveil 'd appears ,
The calm , the smouldering , and the flame
I fondly hoped he 'd come to grief ,
Every hour a new passion can feel ;
In both his hands the dust which lay around ,
He felt that fiends with fiercest hate
And make a crowning for this kingly brow ! --
Has put the last light out .
I know how bright thy virtues shine .
The murmuring flies swirled round in busy strife :
Have those who wander through the ways of death ,
Hath made a god of thee .
And they feel the sun and rain ,
And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain .
While one by one her stars retire ,
No crime of thine our present sufferings draws ,
A moment otherwheres were eons wasted ;
A revelation came on jane ,
Till following , as a clue , that strain
But though this land desired thou never reach ,
The path he took ; and must we fight ,
And here is the green for stringing the daisies !
Whose sobbing voice came faint and weak ,
Aeneas took the word , and thus replies ,
That passion 's slave we ever find --
You have drenched the world with heroic blood ,
Zeus had not else stopped one who rightly knew
In red leaves wound her ,
And bind our chaste affections to his throne .
From veil to veil the vision led ,
Yet not wrapped about with awful mystery ,
The lonely of heart is withered away . ' "
Helping me pass some otherwise long hours ;
It felt life 's surges break ,
Haste in his hurried accent lies ,
Is wisdom and that makes her what she is :
And the years that slowly followed ,
From those mysterious wanderings that filled
This day our armies shall ascend
Those weary limbs have lain ;
Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand .
And gave the orders he desired .
Paying his court to the bumble-bee ,
And shall this day go uneventful by , this day
And after-thoughts brought in their joyous train
He held it right that christians all should use
His presence stands within the gate ,
Foreboding , love seeks for his arrows a prey ,
Who in the old time made that haughty vaunt
Filled the evening star with music ,
And other births will bring us richness and variety .
Who is the maid my spirit seeks ,
Turnd to exploding hiss , triumph to shame
His task performed , he sadly went his way ,
A bit of darkness stilled with fear ,
No base desire lives in that heavenly light ,
The tribute he to beauty paid
Heaven-dew fell upon each soul .
Freewill hath brought us hither , forethought planned
There honour comes , a pilgrim grey ,
That brought with it another civil war .
As dirges sway both imps and damn 'd ,
And lilies into life were brought ;
And memory fondly fills .
The girls , as i recall ,
Loose to the wind their airy garments flew ,
Then turn to wakeful prayer and worthy act .
And every train that rushes from the sea ,
Dance to the music that we make ,
And the moon gave no light !
The son of raghu saw and moved
_ us _ he hath made for utter night ,
Who made through cowardice the great refusal .
" on first looking into chapman 's homer . "
Thy vision will lay hold upon me dead ,
Grief since then his home with me doth make .
The prospect of escape perceived ,
For i must lose my precious blood
Methinks i catch a groan ,
When freedom struck her mightiest blow ,
Where drinkers are draining their draughts of joy .
Died into silence -- and the vision passed --
He framed this rude but solemn strain :
My skill goes beyond the depth of a pond ,
Whom they desire to keep in bonds of love --
The far waves alone are rocking in unrest ,
On chaliced flowers that lies ;
Sinking , his dying fingers caught the strings ,
And loyalty to truth be sealed
This magic power is given , --
With rich magnificence , the chariot placed ;
You have kept the freedom nature gave .
This vengeance follow 'd for our slaughter 'd friends .
Such tribute , warren , as fond poets pay
I can but keep my faithful watch and pray .
The charms a canvas may possess ,
To silence also rise . let there be night ,
Over the tears it has shed ;
Still the plashing fountains play ,
As the heart of childhood brings
So that i felt a movement in my heart
Of noble powres , i see ,
Places which pale passion loves !
To whom sad eve , with shame nigh overwhelmed ,
Never more shall their footsteps falling
When flora fair the pleasant tidings bringeth
Which when the host to charge each other went ,
A child should never feel a fear ,
Give way to frenzied fear ?
Says , it fits that i rehearse ,
An empire 's strength is laid .
Across the stream they took their way ,
O'er his sense , such as ghosts cast .
The arts were kindled with celestial fire ;
Hath a crown of glory won .
And he would feel it to his sorrow ,
With fierce resentment fired maris beheld
The world gave fame and home a solitude !
Then waking , the delusive phantoms flown ,
Wherein throughout her frame she felt
That flattering falsehood round it throws ?
Seeking no more their rebel wrath to rein ,
Our feet are seamed with crimson scars ,
What time he let the reins abandoned fall ,
Till hope 's last beacon light had burned away .
And passed his idle hours instead
Though wide apart the lines our fate has traced
Round white clouds roll slowly above the housetops ,
Past earthly joys he might secure .
Have issued to the heaven that is pure light ;
You never may be led to drink
Went dripping music through her thought .
The sun went down behind the forest ,
Auroral light the eastern oriels touched ,
To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills .
As the swift seasons roll !
And ran a sponge of vinegar to bear ,
The lamp of truth still brightly burned with him ,
It gently said :
Of thunder split the dream , and headlong down
In burning words breathed forth the marvel told ;
And shifting meaning of man 's spiritual worth
That falls on each wound like a balm ,
While the sands o ' life shall run .
Was praise or fame conveyed in that which flies
But that is not how the story is presented .
Twice twenty ships had follow 'd meges forth .
To him nor vanity nor joy could bring .
The lead ran down as it were wax ,
The bitter paths wherein i stray --
To view each saintly brotherhood ,
No more that elm its noble branches spread ,
By little and by little warmed , took fire .
Then the good and sensible youth made answer as follows
And the sun gives way for night ,
A female form as yet so placed
In autumn gold the beeches stand ;
You too without your host have reckoned !
Where all my fond objects of tenderness meet ?
While flames behind , before them lay
But a strong effort quelled it , and she gave
Is it then true , as distant rumours run ,
Yet not for this would lend the champion aid ,
In sweeter strains my song should swell
To heal the wounds that italy have slain ,
Gay bridal trains , and funerals moving slowly .
He sent his resignation in ,
A flower , secret listening as its message flows ,
Scarcely his heart found room within his breast ,
Of creamy opal gems that hold
And all that once was hidden is made plain .
And gave us life immortal in the seas .
But , as a truth unfailing make it ,
And pay our duty to the queen at court
The stars come out ; the fragrant shadows fall
Sadness lay on his pale features .
The friendly face that smiles upon his gaze .
The lowing of the cattle made a gradual moan .
And this first autumn list that brings the new
But sure i hold you sleepless ! " then himself
And filled my bosom with delight
But those passionate eyes speak true , speak true ,
Where he meant frost he scattered flowers .
Thus saying , ajax telamon set forth ,
My frame was shatter 'd , i betook myself
Shall not see one thing of his pleasant things ,
The king did it unfold .
Expectantly with lifted looks of love .
These hurt not thine inheritance ,
Then feed on thoughts , that voluntarie move
Their eyes were lit with artless trust ,
Gives flame and fury to the levin bolt ;
The path runs straight between the flowering rows ,
And found the calm i looked for , or returned
Between the flames that lit the sky ,
Turns , and forth stretches eager for the food ,
Writing bad poems and eating out my heart
There , little baby , there you go ,
She took the deed , but scarcely dared unfold .
Kneaded dough for cakes prepare her .
Who comforted where woe and grief might fall ,
Sorrow and blood about me ? lo , they keep
And many a crown his hand plucks down
A thousand joys and hopes have come ;
Filled with joy is his whole being .
Not alone she found the twilight fair :
And bending trees gave pleasant shade .
Rush , raging as demon of dante --
Which fro the hull his weie hath take ,
Where on earth shall i look for a meal ?
Ill-omened darkness round them came --
The water began to quench the fire ;
Whereon a glorious carpet lay ,
And fair inscriptions fix 'd , and titles read
Thus prayed the sage : the eternal gave consent ,
Who spent a holiday in jail .
And that desire that rippling water gives
On islands set in silver seas .
To hear the mutual moan they made ,
Pictures strange fancies which no tongue can tell .
Slowly melting into sorrow ,
Then o'er the sky a rainbow sprang --
Sad law , which leaves king love uncrown 'd
So manhood comes -- and so it surely goes ,
All spring through they falter and follow ,
But fancy 's boundless empire owned his sway .
And war rose up between their starry brows ,
Love that sings and hath wings as a bird ,
At the gay board their empire can maintain !
Give faithful credence to the story strange ,
There are no gulfs we dare not leap ,
And cupid makes wings of the warrior 's plume .
Is seen in the mind of god .
But , how can we fool that rooster ?
They passed with their old-world legends --
In haste he seeks his tutor 's side ,
Only i know while day grew night ,
Which brings the starless dark .
The valiant heart of noble knight takes keep : "
Sad memory , with thy songs to interfuse ?
That filled the heavenly fields , and flung to earth
Women are poets , if you so take them ,
She cruel-hearted , stained with sin ,
The cheeks with dewy softness burned ;
Their swords flash lightning ; darkly reeking o'er
Called to thy mind , thy heart would burn ;
" let thy prayers to heaven arise ;
As sweetly they came of yore ,
't is to give us love and beauty ;
Through all changes fortune may make .
And duty there with me pursue ,
Many and strange adventures would be found ;
Was utterly whelmed in grief for ilium made
He this time the laughter led ,
Valor to our hope is bound ,
My youthful harp , and strike its solemn chords ;
My steps they follow -- mine , whose conquering signs
Again the blustering east shall blow --
And at his feet its homage pour .
For nought unprosperous shall thy ways attend ,
Cease your complaints , suspend each rising sigh ,
To lean in joy upon our father 's knee ;
Thy soul be skyward bound .
Where sinless sunshine lay :
Maiden ! let us share each other ’s kisses !
Justice of god , how are thy terrors piled ,
So bitter and slow ran down
' t is as a snowball which derives assistance
And i mixed the sweet music of auber
The viennese authorities have melted down
The wind blew hollow frae the hills ,
And some sweet solace i would find ,
Nature boasts of , have possess 'd thee ;
She loved sensation , all her senses thrilled her ;
And was so passing wood with wrath and spite ,
Ma gave a dismal shriek and swooned away ,
Thus by the gory arm of slaughter falls
Such fulness of delight the list ' ner feels .
With his wings all steeped in honey ,
To make this spot his chosen home ; --
Was borne along , beheld that overthrow ,
So mighty was the course they ran
Till resurrection show it to the eyes
And rode triumphant through the civil broil .
The wheel of life no less will stay
Who for a bullock felt a brutal flame .
Than e'er thy heart can feel again .
And calmed the tumults of the seas .
The sea that flows between high heaven and earth ,
Only in far-fetch 'd metaphors appear ;
And gave their hands with nervous jerk .
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear ,
But now , alas , the fatal hour arrives
Close following pace for pace , not mounted yet
I 'd give the world for their sweet art .
To ease tired disappointment 's bleeding heart ,
Let consecrating drops be shed . ”
And he spoke the words which follow :
A gleam comes where the medal 's pinned :
In every hour that passes , o ;
Sleep falls on forest and field .
" we swing upon the hinges of our fate ,
But where is the baby with faith can compare ?
Which other people view with terror ,
The cry of hounds fell on her ear .
Name lost ere by forli its waters run --
Each warlike greek the moving music hears ,
With shame take to flight .
To you from failing hands we throw
Next tripping came a courtly fair ,
( the temple fades . )
Bright hope still shines like a star of night
To carry meaning to the natural heart ;
And of those words your full avengers make ?
And men regard with passionate awe and yearning
Might soften a fiend from hell .
To sadness lent more soothing light .
To clutch the sun and spill its fire
That , budding kisses curled with blown desire ,
This comfort came to me from the second fire ;
As if he heard strange voices call .
And felt his heart change inwardly ,
That scarce the dazzled eye could note ,
Brings hope , and joy is ringing everywhere
I loafe and invite my soul ,
Death-grappled . which shall we see ?
They name the standard of their dearest vow . "
Thus addressed the ancient louhi :
" for my kiss breathed venom in ye ,
Now bathed in blood in hecate 's home .
With such harsh message charged he them dismissed
And shoot forth from its trembling string
Whom other studies , other arts would raise .
New leaves will dance on high -
And then the feelings bind the intellect .
And now this journey took with great delight .
Of the dear names that lie concealed within ' t.
But to employ , those lips were made
Ran to the sea and filled the shore .
The light in the dust lies dead --
And balen , wrung with sorrow , said ,
Abroad his black wings the raven threw ,
Then i drew breath ; they disappeared :
Once more the sword of christ is drawn .
A settled sorrow sate upon their brows ,
Of virtue which thy children hold ,
And as if satisfied , he held his peace .
Whose equal heart holds the same gentleness
And sends you shamed upon your way .
But for warriors to make ready ,
They hide their groans , and gaze with joyful front
Darkness and moonlight wore the same dread hue ,
" as melt the snows your passion goes ,
A sound of girlish laughter smote the air .
Restored me to the eden i had lost .
Like jack i went about alone ,
Leading to life 's achievement ; not god 's wrath
A home where heart and soul may rest .
Through darkness struggling into view ,
' she found me roots of relish sweet ,
And to your doors our sheets convey --
Some hold it strange that love like thine and mine
Here is no home prepared for thee .
Ere years had power to dim their brows
In turn achilles on agenor sprang :
And , as autumnal winds come on ,
A worldly love knows not how to produce reflection .
The royal grace , sits next below the king ;
The glorious corn-seed struggled up to day .
They crack a childish whip , drive puny herds ,
The youth his fear-struck mother bore ,
That of the foremost ranks he takes the lead ;
There shot no glance from ellen 's eye ,
In harbour , when the tempest ceased to blow .
That makes matters worse again .
Steal from their prison places to bear us company .
To take our pleasure .
False curls they found , of every hue ,
Inspirited their voice they raised .
Scarce quenched the thirst it made . nor knowing yet
But hate could dwell if once they flashed the fire
Strings that were strained in rust
Farewell ! what word should answer but farewell
The youth 's attention caught . in wonderment
One lesson which in every wind is blown ,
Be sure the greedy orc will make his prey .
Their beauty might declare :
And now he dives into a rainbow 's rivers ,
And dire tisiphone there keeps the ward ,
Gnawed my heart out , for i knew
Leave thee naked to laughter ,
Bringing forth tones shrill and wailing ;
The third awaited ; to the fourth he gave
And lost itself in darkness , till she cried --
Again with horror did around him peer ;
They with such madnesse execute their rage ;
Times go by turns and chances change by course ,
So i again resorted to the lore
Of the tears the heart sheds inly .
Leaving the little face again serene .
And he spoke the words which follow :
When the harvest came to the full ;
And lose thenceforth from their perverted sight
With the most mighty realm that ever stood .
Unconscious yet of what betrothal meant .
Of her , that church which knows thy worth .
Making death for the king their boast ,
And seldom it is that one sound comes alone ,
I trow it made me proud ;
Ah me ! how quick the days are flitting !
They too whose lives in sin are spent
The voices of youth go with me still ,
Peculiar to some men , which seems to say ,
And crystals of a carven moon declining .
This is the gift thy constant zeal hath won ;
I give but the love of all ages ,
Like late wounds run the wrinkles on thy brow .
The northern foes have trod us down ,
O god , give me rest from a thought !
Swift to the chariot springs the god of joy ;
And if a tear steal down ,
Heroic powers attend him still . ”
For well my spirit knows that she
Unbound , the free streams sing ,
A branch off , then rejoined the rest
The stars send down upon them through the night .
The ancient poet turned my steps , reflecting
So , gradually her folly dies ,
The moon had circled westward full and bright ,
The numberless living portraits that are drawn
Then desire arose within himâ  
“ while now this spirit holds . my primal wish
That reached along that barren land .
Of love made manifest beyond our fear :
A king might wish to hold in fee .
The night we felt the earth would move ,
Beyond it lies a haven --
I laid my own to beat ,
In hopes that it might tend to make amends
And drain the dregs of heaven ’s relentless hate ?
" joy drowns the twilight in the dew ,
Murphy was billed to take the fatal plunge .
It came with benediction and with grace .
Hence comes the planter 's wealth , hence commerce sends
The sword of iron succeeded , and the shape
For answer , spurred against the cavalier ;
Sir elvar took his lonely way :
For thanne he set his parlement
And the great terror , senseless lay the band ,
The dew across my tired eyes to comfort them .
And far her fame had spread throughout the land .
The sparkle of her eye i caught ,
But little boats should keep near shore .
Shall bring a kindred calm , and the sweet breeze
The western wind blew down , and played
Its golden lilies mingled with the rose ;
How can they keep me from hating my kind ?
Athwart the resurrection 's shining goal ,
But their noise played havoc with the angel-choir
These tithes have fetched three hundred pound ;
That every wicked sight is hid from the eye ,
With heart and soul thy search renew .
So troubled , and thy soul cast down ? ”
Soon as the suitors from the banquet rose ,
Behold thine images , how they stand ,
Tasting the warm sun ere it dipped
An awful , silent look of anguish wore ;
My voice magenta 's charges sped .
Pagan kisses never cloy .
Shall bind my heart for evermair ,
To her right hand came the red one ,
And just her wisest monarch made a fool ?
Will find its proper level ; and they aim
Why should it make me sorrow ?
To draw the hornets in like bees ,
Old christmas is come for to keep open house ,
Their glory , that eternal fame inherit :
I held that thou wouldst surely scorn
Unto her hierarch nature 's voices come
Who clasped his knees with wailing screams ;
Not to be mirrored in a holy song --
Then added , in the certainty of faith ,
My same old sorrow comes creeping out .
Much mockery followed after as he went ,
Did to his children the strange tale reveal ; "
As each to other passed the generous cheer .
Round the half-glimpsed turrets slowly wash again ;
That i this sacrament take me upon ,
Then untamo , thus made answer ,
Scaring their foes from biding the red fray .
For wealth is nothing when with life compared .
To drench with christian blood the thirsty plain .
That i whose heart goes up with the soaring woods
Soon reach 'd the frigate , which without delay
And find that all has been worth while ;
Now let your inspiration show it .
Beyond us some short space , in answer came .
Do comfort find , thinking how great will be
In art or nature aught so passing sweet ,
And shake the forest when i roared ,
So may the soul that warmed it rise !
Of disobedience ; firm they might have stood ,
That set him weep .
Another water joins it ; then it turns ,
Grown wiser for the lesson given ,
Deeply thought and long reflected .
Bearing with you a comfortless twinge of regret .
The life that grows majestic with the years
From my lips the tones are gliding ,
And set them in the firmament of heaven
Which the mighty god of heaven shook
She faded midst italian flowers --
Blent with each ill would come such bliss
The faults of plain women are easily seen .
The rapids , tossing high their foam . the night
Till judgment should direct him to the gate .
Then his aged mother made him answer :
His boughs make music of the winter air ,
And fix some term of punishment , —
And gave it an easy swing
Which would bring success unto him ;
These pious fool ' ries move not us ,
And as thy shade will follow thee . "
Time 's rolling years have worked decay .
In wisdom , that taught and tried ,
The captain leapt and left his prayers
The arm that held him prisoned cleft .
Where thought must follow the fashion of thought ,
And smashed , to cleanse the world of guilt .
He fought his doubts and gathered strength ,
Drawn by the immortal horses of his sire .
You 'll find him a blessing ,
A scepter o 're a mighty realm to hold .
Each turned above a face of love
The linen white revealed the coals aglow .
Hammered by the sun 's sweet maidens ,
O'er all the earth thy kingdom come !
Some beautiful soul that lived life strongly
Of desperate combat bid the host of troy
Her pledge , a flower , the maiden gave ,
That to our folly or our guilt we owe .
Thus the two made oath together ,
Their virgin waters ; the full region leads
Give to his eyes their former fire ,
The north and south stood side by side :
Where globes of fruit shine blue ; here stray
Upon my praises following , of the eighth
Alone thy fell revenge pursue ?
Out of my life : i came to miss
_ how _ shall the baby go ?
To break the heathen and uphold the christ ,
Makes me powerful over others . "
But all of the things that belong to the day
These to attack the britons came --
This night our ruin or our safety sees . "
Into its space a universe now steals ;
Then melted in her smile ,
Where old giles summers lies .
But the crying would not stop .
They look to more than truth , and so confirm
The true great heart is often found remote
Little cares , nor feels disheartened ,
Take all the rest the sun goes round !
You can make sacrifices , too .
Few crowns , made favors of , nor dare object
Therefore is given us , because our vows
And every flame a sinner steals away .
In early spring , when winds blow chilly cold ,
All tongues from uttering what all glances told --
Upon the eve of doomsday taken
They have given the voice of england 's fame
The great tears sprang to their meeting eyes ;
The demon , for the fray prepared ;
And where with moving melodies there break thee ,
And that made up a pair-royal .
And shadowing forests , gloomy as the grave .
To loyalty 's converse can range ,
She dwelt -- so ran the tale -- alone .
I crave or hers that brought it . dead ,
The crow makes wing to the rooky wood ,
The golden light should lie ,
In gory cerements gibbering spectres glide ;
Broken premonitions come ,
Or fill with sudden tears the eyes that read .
Before the mountains heav 'd their heads
The beam of sadness lit her eye ,
Our foreheads felt the wind and rain .
Whose shadows over me are thrown ?
Fear and terror walked before him
To where his people 's fires burn bright .
Bright , alluring dreams arise ,
I 'd want to meet and master strong resistance ,
And fraudful arts directed ;
Rise again for home and freedom ! set the battle
Farewell , voice that all ears could win ,
From out the hills , where twilight stands ,
Then on the gilded track leading to the mountains ,
The city ' of grief encompasses , which now
Had turned his back , their silence first was broken
And now there came both mist and snow ,
This answer uttered , worthy of the shrines :
His tears as they swiftly coursed down .
Desire him come , and make me aid ,
Beautiful lay the region of her tribe
Of shadowed kopjes struck against the sky .
Possessed , new joy the spirit fills ,
't was property their freedom saved ;
A goodly harvest must to thee arise .
Has tracked the chilly gray !
Is the debt that we owe to you .
And all alone , set sail by silent moonlight
And hectic autumn came and brought its charm
At her lips it fluttered and failed
Upon our country 's border lay ,
And the drums strike more convulsive ,
To the fourth barrier then we made our way ,
Their love will cancel all that hate can do .
Then the haze lifted . bombing on the right
Flames from her eyes shot forth and burned ,
While the fallow ploughland turned up nigh
The string , that felt its airy flight ,
An angel siren joins the vocal strain ;
But through the songs of poets look ,
Unearthly was the hymn , which then arose .
And see where the pretty moon goes .
That only serves to make us grieve
Out of the night that covers me ,
On happy faces where the feast was spread .
My love is summer passing through the land .
Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection .
With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet .
At last by starvation and famine made bold ,
And to swell the reckoning go .
The army of nicanor comes against us .
From gangá , by the god set free ,
His fingers snapped , and his trousers clapped ;
I make an image of creation .
Then fickleness soon bids it onwards be flowing ;
Their belief with blood have sealed :
Loud crashing thunders roared .
So , took a berth afore the mast ,
A long and noble life he passed ,
From under the trees they drew him last :
That from the road-side gently lead the eye
My soul , as home she springs ; --
Which makes the world selfish in seeming . my part
Which will no range to thought allow ,
The battle lost by england 's hate ,
Heavily groaned the helm of birch-wood ,
The third day comes ; o what a sin !
Around whose narrow mouth hell-flames forever rise ;
That calls beneath the sea ;
Your manhood , bend no suppliant knees ,
For joy returned , for peace restored ,
That sent me home at night full .
The guilty secret ; lips , for ages sealed ,
The weather with my parting is in keeping ,
There the roses flutter their petals ,
The loveliest things that still remain
And ask my business there .
By high education brought pressure to bear .
From what the place afforded , could be given .
And there lingered on thine eyes
Wind blows , bearing cold clouds over the ocean ,
My frame was shatter 'd , i betook myself
Take heed in time , nor fondly hope
" virgil had considered that the greatest virtues of augustus
A year has gone , as the tortoise goes ,
See skinner himself , the fighting attorney ,
The curtain rose . a fat girl with a pout
With smiling eyes reflecting heaven 's blue , with heads
And through the hubbub brought her ,
With green traces tying them to the chariot .
Where the mad throstle sings in bliss
Our intellect is to such depth absorb 'd ,
You 'd have settled the brute that attempted to shoot
And that wild sound rose o'er the cry
And ever the truth comes uppermost ,
And the surplus is farmers ' profit made .
And sacred night her awful shade extend . "
For still when drowsiness comes on
Yet feel this dread creep gray along the air .
Until his very steps have left a trace
His anguish flooded over ; with clenched hands
My clay with long oblivion is gone dry :
To help the glory of his italy ?
The candle shed a feeble ray --
The hapless heart that 's stung by thee ! "
A faint rank taint like april coming ,
It draws up vapours which obscure its rays ;
Yniol with that hard message went ; it fell
Haunted and trembling with your song .
Time got his wrinkles reaping thee
Unto diana 's house i took my way ,
Out of joy did joy come welling ,
For hearts that win eternal youth .
The other yet shall give a life to thee ,
Just as no turkey ever dreamt
The chord of love made visible ,
The flood kept on roaring ,
Which if it doth within the soul remain ,
Soon filled them all with great delight .
Easier the death-pang had been borne .
" immortal fame his deathless labours gave ;
Many a jest told of the keys betraying
If i may gain such favour , as to gaze
Thou know ' st our hearts are always set
Like those of old ) to lips that made
The judgment day has come , i fear ! "
While moonlight falls on stream and wooded leas .
The flowers are bursting forth ,
A bar of modest numbers shared the grain .
But give me real , sterling wit ,
To meet the shock of battle are prepared ;
Let god take notice , and reward the gift !
And toss the miles aside for me .
They felt by its beats her heart expand --
The deadly slumber of frost to creep ,
So messengers in hurry through all the country went ;
My lips have sung the praises of my lord .
To ease the aching place ! "
Seeking god 's arteries from which it came .
Remounted my conductor and drew me .
But night came from the rim of autumn skies ,
As first in rank , the monkey spoke :
New statutes rise , and stronger laws succeed ;
By battle broke , and thrust aback by fate
That made it long excuse the length .
That seeks out the clear silver tide ,
And when you get _ real suffering _ among ,
With such a joyous smile , it made me sigh
And mists that spread the flying shroud ;
The pledge with us by such a husband placed ,
Words such as these in turn addressed
You love me , and i find you still
A brother brings , with love inspired ,
Our three days ' love lies slain ;
For therein , plain and certain , shall ye see
The faith we had not found .
Here lay nets , here lines were resting ,
To hover between smiles and tears ,
To the wood i went for berries ,
And ye , beneath life 's crushing load ,
To feel the throbbing of thy timid heart ,
Terror went before him ,
The king of elephants should bear thy weight .
It shall never go to mana ,
Whose glorious clusters glow and burn .
The ocean lay behind ; and yet my boat
With resignation tore her .
" and so in prison were they laid --
I have heard the drums roll " farewell ! "
The rush of rain descending .
And they throughout the darkest days diffuse
The albatross did follow ,
The flowers do fade , and wanton fields
We felt the minutes crawl :
Floats and swings the horizon 's bound ,
The two young kings together alike the presence sought .
And lifts to the changing moon
The sweets of love are mixed with tears .
Went to the old man 's heart ,
The sky broke out in red dismay
But eternal watch shall keep ,
Or name a victim , did the doom withhold ;
And to his wholesome counsel added pray ' r.
And my heart shall not be shaken .
Mind informs the matter , nature 's complexity ruling .
Nothing can tame me , nothing can bind ,
Quiet lay the sturgeon , nahma ,
Would wash their ashes pure again .
For kinsmen dear , by hearty friendship bound .
Where there were two , one shuddering shadow lay ,
And folly wonders at the flight she made :
And for their graceful shapes return they fulness ;
The lost to honour , in his glory clothed ,
Be mine the eyes that trace it next !
Headlong to deeds of death the hosts are driven ;
I hear a voice that says , " rejoice ,
And to my heart such kindly courage ran ,
Man was made to mourn . a dirge
The witches follow them to bed .
The burden of my days is hard to bear ,
As once the nobler athens went
I went into religion to forget .
Crowds went toward the vatican .
On which the south wind scarcely breaks
The wave awakens rolling images of soft embraces ;
Have found that lordly christ apocryphal
But fortune now ( the lots of empire thrown )
Far off scarce fills the exulting eye
Still warm benevolence sits smiling there .
And feel that life is wisest spent
Beyond that gulf a saviour shows his face .
Till he had brought the warrior front to front ,
This endless outrage shall they still sustain ?
Dimly the soft and musing form is seen
We in whose bodies the blood of them runs ,
A word came to me , wonderful and good ;
What made sleep flutter his wings and part ?
Papa , was buying love too dear .
But train my soul to lead a line --
The clammy death-sweats coldly rise ;
The heart keeps its tough old persistency still ;
Just now as the sun began to sink ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
The glow that mantles in their cheek --
It 's making a beautiful present ,
Ranged in due order as the lots assign ,
To make it win ,
And year by year our memory fades
Only the mightier movement sounds and passes ;
Of the candles that shed their soft lustre
Then with a rush they closed like thunder-clouds
Of fire , gave way beneath the blow .
As he his most delightful work pursued ,
Ready notice gave he to his burgundian lords .
When the sun went away .
Whom grave reflection leads to pain .
And dreams that stood the ministers of hell !
The brook that springs in yonder height ;
With starry feelings quivered through .
That takes the light and colour from the day !
Death with black hands extends his mighty pall ;
Nor spread arachne o'er her curious loom .
So shines the diamond of the mine ,
But i will beat my wings above the pitch ;
Every day points out my duty .
I laid my own to beat ,
The cart where an abyss just met the road .
To thee the face of song is lifted now ,
And the moving shades of sentries ,
At this time arose a certain king sears ,
To bid this vision go ?
' mid laughing trills to flow .
" my youth and inexperience weighed , "
All things lay bare : the future yet unveiled
These figures lead to the threshold of the seventeenth
May call up others which give sore distress .
The clouds , in rushing legions bore
With sanguinary drops , is shed .
His offer takes , and enters a new road ,
And he makes his profession pay .
Whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn
Had traced the image graven on her heart .
Is seized with a fancy for churchyard reflections ;
Doomed to the dust , or lodged already there .
Alluding to a tax lately laid upon leather .
Join to make justice of the direst doom .
But while his heart was fit to burst ,
" now , as it oft befalls a cavalier
As these distinguished honors came they found him each time
Clouds , dimly lighted , gathering slowly ;
To shield himself than put you on your guard :
Made passing trash of empires , and his eyes
The indulgence you have given it to-night ,
Of truth the insurgent rout was quelled .
He took his servant 's hand and led the way
His pleasures always turned to pain --
" that he must cast despair away ! "
What our present realized
The unconquerable powers that can not lie .
Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float --
For he it was ( the aged legends say )
Then on the pyre their bodies cast
Lean back , and get some minutes ' peace ;
But the floods and the tears meet and gather ;
That shook along the windings of the cave
For ruin follows time and means ill spent .
By fragrant oil sustained the clear flame glows
With sunsets strung upon it thick , like pearls .
Which , calling its flock to their special clover ,
The sea-foam swept to daisy 's feet .
Yet still my hell within myself i bear .
The wanderers of the ocean find repose ,
Showed in what sport the night had flown .
" take courage , bird ;
Where clusters grew , and ( every apple stripped )
And his drooped head sinks gradually low --
He falls the victim of those furious two ,
Through groans raised wild , the hopeless hymn
All passed was his sickness and his sorrow . ]
That his breast was born for song .
The spring calls and beckons with gracious insistence , --
Calls seamen to engage in praise and prayer ,
And their day goes over in idleness ,
The voice that gave thy soul to hear
Draw his soul , that strays so far ,
't is this makes christian triumph a command :
From labour could not wean them ,
In the days when our life is made new ,
An ' its complicated noo , ye see ,
A peace to the nations will nothing restore
And night shall fold him in soft wings .
And some strange shadows threw .
Dare to take poison from a sage 's hand ,
For godfrey 's valor small or nothing shrank ,
Stormy , through driving mist ,
Like music his soft speech must flow ! --
Fired with an abstract love of virtue , she ,
And was he graceless reckon ’d ,
Had force to rise from apathy ,
The searching sun , the open sky ,
Out of the mud drew creeping things ,
With swelling sails make good the promised port ,
Where the cliffs arise from water .
My comfort stood : and the bright sun was now
Her own with eyes that shone as softly there .
But the bubbles broke on the surface ,
The silver thames reflects its marble face . }
Has reached our melting heart of hearts ,
Oh ! for the gift to tell thy destiny ,
One iron rule at sea binds everyone .
It chanced one day , when the north wind blew
The bubbling waters played near the excavations .
But eyes through which the deep soul looks .
To see thy beauty and to share thy joy ,
And turn a stony gaze on human tears ,
Up sprang the youth -- deep fell the sword ,
The bow perusing with exactest eye .
But swift the thought of vengeance rose .
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose ,
Who fills their breast and makes his dwelling there .
The jovial rhymes , that still remain ,
Like whirlwinds , whose contending sway
As round the hill its way it wends .
The life i got i quickly lost ;
Take care , so near the horizon ,
Than even winter 's drifting snows ,
Or with such weight of jealously had wrought
Burst to find itself despisèd .
Did make provision , thorough grace alone ,
Suns and their bright broods swim .
Shivering to the sad sounds . they sank away
And nature claimed thee her domestic tree .
Till the sun dropped from the heaven ,
The rage of hunger and of thirst repress 'd :
And cleanse us from each stain of sin ,
To feel the veil of centuries withdrawn ,
Whence then came her eyes of fury ?
Rinaldo all the treacherous plot displayed ,
Thro ' the diamond panes the moonlight rains
Will put on their summer claes ;
Tyrannic power , but raging to pursue
Then leaving life , earl percy took
And every wound the tortured bosom feels ,
To bear the burden of a heavy heart , --
On the humour that makes merry
Swells to a tide of thought , whose surges leap
The day arrives , the smiling sun ,
Jumping about his room and spilled the clock ,
That in trim gardens takes his pleasure : --
The vision came to me ,
That far and wide his fame extended ,
As fits the merry christmas time .
He led from africa to swell his power ;
Wine waxes in power in that desolate hour
Of agony and fear , which rise anon ,
With musters counted as cattle
And followed half awake and half asleep ,
Ah , years are filled with learning ,
The king 's court in this reign arose ;
And the creek of life goes winding on ,
There shone his emblem . light divine !
E'er swung such sweetness on the air !
For beauties that from worth arise
The loveless road that knows no resting place ,
Would it blur the christmas glee ,
That laugh , as if transported with some fit
Nor go when dust is gone to dust .
And fate had determined they never should more .
As ancient books declare .
Driven by the goddess of the painted bow .
Now war is over and a world set free ,
Fold me and fill me with your hot caress ,
For horror shaped the wild in wrathful mood ,
You were the warm rain blowing from the south .
The ways you found to say the praise of comfort
To handle the tallest mast ;
The devil came to tempt saint anthony .
On him whose hand with slaughter glowed
Ages and ages have passed , --
What could advancing age have added more ?
Phantoms and fables fly .
Ere the shadows of night come drooping down . --
Ai n’t extended to squatters , old son ;
She dropped her voice , and softly made reply .
Which shows all those , and in thine eyes
There comes the flush of violet !
What time this dome revered her prudent lord ;
Hath made a kind heart bleed ,
The elm trees showed their dress of golden brown
Sad to your sympathetic glooms i fly ;
And earth will hide my lonely rest ;
The glad waves leave the beaches of my heart ;
Still what a royal aspect he retains !
The humid air is burdened with the rose ;
When their memory to the islands reaches ,
And kissed her ere she fell asleep !
So fair he seemed that all the court regarded .
Distressed she combats with revolted nations ,
That made thy heart sweet for an hour , --
Whole years of folly we outlive ,
And her red lips sang them a love song .
So glad i watch the moments fly
Bidding the heavens and earth make way
Tried souls , ' mid untried spirits found ,
They kept me in a constant funk .
Sadder the croft where , thrusting gray and high
His flanks by presses conjuring fear ; -
And gave his back a crick ,
" inclosed please find appointment . " presently
But once the gas commenced to go ,
Things that are made to fade and fall away
Weeping to him to lend himself to us .
Red sparks whirled up the chimney ,
Come one , come all , you stand or fall
Draw rainy tears from stubborn eyes ;
And hear -- o , strange to those that lay
I am dissolved and woven again . . .
He catches at the man impatiently ,
Nor chambers hide her valor shining bright ;
Thy heart fails not . rich treasures will i give
And set it on her curls of yellow hair .
He done ' stablish a fine school ,
But where the woods waved low and green ,
Your sterling merit 's widely blown
Where east and west are met , --
It pass , and intercept our better fates :
A well of peace within it springs ;
The universe unfolds ; all properties
Such awful , awful times it makes .
And one last flame send boston to the sky .
Till they get hearts refin 'd and pure ,
And he in loneliness : he felt assur 'd
A thousand years went by , and still
Then , by the gathering demons pressed
Or try with cheerfulness to bear my lot ?
Too long like children we have stood , the time
And in its silence pass the sabbath-day .
In its own fashion , the sharp point it moved
O'er the dun gloom a dreadful glimmering throw ?
Thy name has lighted near a century gone , --
That haunt thee of past anguish , shall be added
High dreams of ages gone ! --
He who with life makes sport ,
Cautious footsteps drawing near .
He sought renown , and found his subjects yield
Seven times the fatal cord he drew ,
Then fierce and wild contention rose :
Anither 's aye hae heart to feel .
To bedeck those proud upstarts that swagger ?
The clutching agony , the fears ! --
Then he spoke the words which follow :
Perhaps mankind might find the path they miss --
Love that projects himself upon a life ,
And that sings the after-sleeping
Whose audacity lent him a charm ?
His loyalty or grandeur showed .
And all are to be sold , if you consider
The soul that casts on him its every care ;
The breeze their magic path attends ;
Whence from those steep 'd within loud shrieks arose .
Soothed by all the winds that pass ,
Collided and locked in a mighty embrace
But after this came crueler remorse ,
And each soul but one love , i add ;
_ but only love may lead love in _
And , while the mortal mist is gathering , draws
And pull descending vengeance from on high .
Her cheerful head , and leads the golden years .
Though a wide compass round be fetched ;
The quiet ages picked it up ,
I felt that from folly fast growing to crime --
To make them solemn . there are some i know
It brings bad tidings : how it hourly blows
Bring misery and death to her i love --
Shrank the steel , tempered thrice to show
Feebly he asked , heaving a sigh ,
How little of the past would stay !
Where sweeping meadows meet the azure sky ,
While the eternal pleasure , which direct
The healing herbs began to seek :
To ride in high career ,
But as the lark the lights that spill
Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union .
Silent , seeing that love alone
Where purple violets creep ,
Yet touched and shamed by ridicule alone .
These lands will redden with their children 's gore ,
How the heart of the minstrel is breaking !
And then a nimbus light hung o'er
It sometimes comes from deafness and from
That spoke so sweetly , and so well .
Up to your haughty pallaces may mount ;
Heaves and sinks with her golden sighs ,
Fast , silent tears were flowing ,
That sent the infant to its last long rest .
Thine eyes have told me lover 's sweetest tale ,
Their looks contemptuously speak ,
Feathers men make various uses .
And thus he makes his moan :
Which by and by black night doth take away ,
The world hath set its heavy yoke ,
Content in our father 's allotments to fall .
In vain he strove to breathe a prayer ,
For blood and vengeful carnage burned ,
That many mere , male , mortals find
To lose in the anguish of others
Eurus and notus shake the forest deep ,
Quaint houses rise on either hand ,
And his strong heart leaped within him ,
Merlin or falcon that the game pursue .
How his heart pants ! you see
Whence from those steep 'd within loud shrieks arose .
Yet this alone out of my life i kept
Whereby this happy change upon thee fell . "
Are touched , are turned to finest air .
Attend the causes which my muse have led : --
" from the lake there comes rejoicing ,
Feeling of pain and pleasure . spirit , linked
The fever held him -- the captain said ,
Our history 's read by youth and sage ,
Where lanká ’s royal city lay ,
Were men of earth made wise in watch .
No hunger urging . frequent birds and beasts ,
And finding oft occasion to be fanned ,
That floats away where it properly may ,
To welcome him with joy that brings me woe :
Will adopt our style of music .
Who the prize of life has gained . "
For one whose feet made music as they fell
Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue .
That season could get
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank ,
And feel that its burdens we never can bear ;
The guests are met , the feast is set :
But spent and racked with mortal pains ,
Where none but elders laid their head ;
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears .
He thought that something good remained , and so
To weave them into joy for you .
Trembling their forces , sound their praises lowd .
When mists are white and the dew lies pearly
Will take possession of that sacred store
Since youth must fall , when it should rise !
Has cheered his spirit and dispelled his sorrow !
Shall come new victory .
Some show a smile and some a frown ;
Six years had marked their weary length
Seems held and folded in by golden noons ,
To my sage counsel therefore did i turn .
A radiance that perishes never .
With over anxiety and make her fail .
Why do sinners ' ways prosper ? and why must
And to their flowers the swarming bees invite ,
To feel her fair ethereal wings
And sends the life abroad through either wound .
A sob suppressed , -- again
And he spoke the words which follow :
In her light chariot quickly is convey 'd ;
The words hiss into me , like raindrops falling
Thus the first ages passed ,
Through wood and dale , the sacred river ran ,
Tuonetar makes this answer :
And every evening , as the daylight dies ,
Admiring much the dinner spread so neat .
A man 's soul crying , behold what worth
And he that sent it , felt the pain ,
Fate to thy body gave a fitting grave ,
And when the blades the warm suns bring
Far in the brooding future , make a past
They catch from the past
All three turned sorrowing glances on aldona .
As the wonders of old i trace ,
Our life is short , and our days run
And waned the antique light prometheus brought ,
Singing , she wrought , and her merry glee
This is the man that drew it all
To breathe an ejaculatory prayer ,
The flower of faith that grows to unseen fruit .
Even i with poets have obtain 'd a name ,
Who now to woeful war be kindling thee .
But viewing then , whereas she made
To him who showed to her such courteous lore ,
And how does the sextant stand ? '
And princely counsel in his face yet shone ,
To where the night no moonbeam shows ,
Faded autumn leaves are trembling ,
To all who still the church 's part take ,
And sunshine struck across the polished floor .
Took up the gauntlet life had thrown ,
Beside a bed of sickness sat
The wife whose fingers fed the fire
To bring their contests to a close ,
Right and duty they inspire ,
As the springs to meet the sunshine ,
Thou art alone the one from whom i took
While fools put money on , sir !
He , still more aged , feels the shocks
And sucked by priestly cannibals .
But she felt her strength was failing ,
And shrill and shriller swelled the cry
Of the bright crown that time prepares for me .
Long from the lists of love i stood aloof
The london streets to roam .
Till vain frenzy awoke and he died ; and him
Her steps are not with trailing garments stayed ,
Where forests wait with giant trunk and bough
That flush to crimson where skies have kist ;
A glittering palace rose , with mailed men
The bill i 'll settle to-morrow .
The confidence of reason give ;
Confused and broken -- come and gone --
Doth every beast keep holiday ; --
Dark , chill november had been ushered in ,
I reckon 'd not if i won or lost ,
Next day there came the postman 's knock ,
In modest truth no light nor beauty find .
They took all common sleep ; therefore he claims
So , with a rouse , went christmassing !
So the devil may take the hindmost .
All earthly things , making them pure and good .
And with his tongue declared it true
Winter held the track .
And voices breathed round reghu 's son ,
This hymn with gurgling throats they strive to sound ,
Of the dangers hid in darkness .
No phantom ; but i drag a wretched life ,
The number small , which happiness can bear .
And yet the weary went to him for rest .
In the shadow time has cast ;
Each time that sword of god takes edge
The wind at tourney comes and goes ,
My conscience said : ' a uniform of blue
Gives him every needed comfort ,
There was something the season wanted ,
The added pain of life that transcends art --
Doubt not ; the earth will yield me roots ,
This which goes cleaving the audacious prow ,
I could lean me wi ' pleasure beside thee ,
Now nearing the finale of her dreams ,
Had worn itself in tears , from food refrain .
Which your rays yield , solar star . '
If he cheats i drop him flat .
His readiness to feel his pulse and tell
Shall leave no vestige of this flower .
Where did the soul of every member come .
Sometimes came glimpses glad of the blue sea ;
That thames 's glory to the stars shall raise !
We 'll hold communion sweet ,
Though doomsday came , by any art be made
Through years of sorrow we must pass to truth .
Though they may make corruption gape or stare ,
Which comes upon us when we tread the ways
That 's how the error has arisen . "
Oh ! youth will turn as the world turns ,
That could express a lover 's pain ;
The delicate stem most deeply love the rose .
Where the veins have snapped asunder ,
The red sunlight lazily lay .
As the years went rolling onward
He gives to range the dreary sky ;
Kings overthrown , and kingdoms have redeemed !
With the universe ranged at my side .
And find myself in love , beholding in her
While friendship from a pocketbook would talk ;
And set the golden throne beneath his feet .
Now it has come to say farewell ?
Where stood the people all dismayed and sad ,
Wealth shook within his gilded home
Tall windsor shows no blossom like this wight
Come when the shadows fall ,
More dreadful than the tempest lash 'd the seas ;
No room where little , little love might dwell .
Is not in me sufficient courage found ,
With wrangling talents form ’d for foul debate :
Will winners be to break or slay .
That ever was met on a holy-day
His dearly bluvd lost oss again
Such were the bitter thoughts to which i turned .
Drink the dews and lift their song ,
Which told that she was " out . "
Love 's a fire that needs renewal
Where throning he her faith in him maintained ;
His brave heart trembling for the fleet of greece .
“ better with foes thy dwelling make ,
The swallow has followed the daffodils ;
With me her glowing image stay 'd .
Suns that shine by night ,
From it she raised such flame and smoke
Draws from dull death his lost eurydice ,
Be as the cloud that flecks the seas
Those spiritualists are always seeing things !
Now at these words the tears ran down apace
Come into extreme peril , dashed along .
Whatever sun may light my roving ;
God spreads the heavens above us like great wings
O day that ever runs before !
That argued fear . "
Peculiar to some men , which seems to say ,
Or scatter 'd spot of dusky green ,
They shine upon the corpse 's face ,
The waters run
That makes the rose sae sweet ,
A wooden lath , bearing buddhist texts , planted
He saw no terrors in the world to come .
Rose against cronos and made war in heaven ?
Will not make the soft ore harden . '
Feeble with suffering , calling night and day
For the good is lying near ,
Some harpies of england our prizes we 'll make .
Had brought it down from father unto son ,
Each cast a wistful look on each ,
With which the winds of heaven can claim accord ,
Which leads beholders on a boggy walk ,
And monstrous , thy good arm deliverance gave ;
Lo ! the height that i had taken ,
Princes and peasants lay together mixt ,
I marvel how their hearts bear up so long ;
Historic marbles to record his praise ;
I made response to him with bashful forehead .
To pass the pale thought by .
Even for the change that comes
The doom that o'er this heart must fall ,
The waves lie still and gleaming ,
That man was made to mourn .
This makes a sad betrothal night .
And they felt anxiety .
They grasped the impious horror of the war .
Withal did love call unto him the wind
Renews the sad remembrance of our fate :
Of a splendor that came and went ,
To share the dangers of the border war ;
All hope is fled ,
As if a voice within him cried , " beware
Fair to the world let every page be set ,
Hungry outcasts go :
And sorrowful old age that comes by night
To take their pay of sorrow or of mirth ,
When the bee-hive casts its swarm ;
She kisses me , recalling not the place
Shall safety to italia 's plains arise ,
That immense infinite orb where god himself doth sit .
No mayor alive can close the house .
By reprobate desire thus madly led ,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death
Tints that spot the violet 's petal . "
And where their smiles have rested there came forth
The world is built of brick and mortar ,
The blue and scarlet flames leaped high ,
And the tear blinded his ee ;
And to the world this beacon gave ;
But soon my weakness find :
In ancient days -- fame tells the fact --
Where men crushed for me the grapes of joy ,
Who warred unscathed for blessings that it gave --
Religion there is made no sport ,
The winds that mount and sing while empires fall ,
Are ripe to burst with love of me .
While others suck their blood and smile and smile .
Even this acknowledged , leaves us still in debt :
The brave blithe hearts within them bound ,
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
When answer made the love that was therein :
Law can discover sin , but not remove ,
The beauty that shone upon her
All , that which gains immortal life in song ,
As if just born of darkness sprung !
Before the enemy struck the blow
The sound of mingled voices rang ,
Sends forth his active mind from place to place ,
If any bliss my soul can see
To them i hold that we are bound
To seek one nature that is always new ,
Wherethrough their dim growth hardly strikes and shoots
All that 's ever got by thieving
And sullen clouds drooped low
That death stole intact her young dearness
By which the seraphims our lips inspire :
Where the river goes curving and broadening down
Pale shivering poverty , that stalk 'd behind ,
And lift her veil of night and mystery ;
Where the sole phoenix makes her nest , although
Of that fair evening had been so ill spent ,
Their light in equal distribution pour 'd .
That here ancestre brak the lawe .
Which all the way from earth to heaven reached ,
No ill befall whom he doth keep ;
Into the shadows , painting them with bright
All faded into gray ?
When hail and fire above it ran .
A charm that is never evaded or broken ,
The waters wild went o'er his child ,
As weighty bodies to the centre tend ,
The crowd says it will make my name --
It brings men only envy and distrust .
" a pagan therefore thee i fostered have ,
An instinct within it that reaches and towers ,
By quickly making one of two .
Truth never harmed anything yet but pretense .
The heath , a lake of darkness , lay
To bridewell hurried with remorse and pain .
Sublime in air his course he took
Astern and to leeward lies the land ,
Though no gloomy story you made me believe .
Love gives us copious potions of delight ,
Hath nights of boyhood to fond memory brought .
The moon in her phases is found ,
How beautiful they lie , and bright ,
I took for granted , just as he ,
That deity should stoop to our disguise !
There came a sound of music , thrown afloat
With blows their way towards the box they take ;
It seem 'd to follow with the chaise ,
In flying fragments shot the evening 's flame ,
And breathe forth the message i trust to thee ,
Hold subject lest the grand destruction come .
A gentle rain comes stealing up from the east
Burnt and consumed where’er it came .
Human hearts are tossed and drifted
With eagle eye he measures out the land
The shadows raced across the blind .
That charm that can the strongest quell ,
The thraldom of thy woe to sever .
Of visions , by calliope revealed
When darkness filled the earth till the ninth hour .
Let the minions of fortune and fashion go roam ,
The arts of falsehood and the moors prevail ;
To liberty she holds pretended claim --
And all their hells were made of human hate ;
It seems that spain is bolting with the stakes !
Executions are not stayed ,
Her too in autumn turned a vintager ;
When they share no more in the battle yell ,
The rosy clouds float overhead ,
What makes the light in them sparkle and spin ?
That finds her dead with the may ,
Driven by a parent 's unrelenting frown ,
Which is so great that there i go
Fire i 'll thrust into my stockings ,
While through the air his challenge rang ,
Bids them not break the worship . forth he flies
Bring thou thine innocence , thy stainless soul ,
Strains by good thoughts attended , like the spring
A sullen face of fog that lifted slow ,
What filled them all with awe ;
Had graced the triumphs of his trojan foe ,
Not latium shall contain , nor europe bound :
And how a change had come . and then
The night we felt the earth would move
Lulled lay the smooth and silent sea ,
And sets me a ' on flame . "
The conqueror 's title should to him belong .
Beauty 's grace , that should rise
Kiss with blind lips that seek beyond the lips ,
After the hour has struck , to close again .
Which his double capacity hit to a nicety ;
Then the rough wind tossed wide the petals red ;
Life turned the meanest of her implements ,
Deck it with sun and moon and stars ,
The iron clamps , that held the stones together ,
The lord of gods then gave consent ,
The life that almost dies in me ; "
From " siege gun battery " came a roar
They soon settled the business of billy barlow .
Which sinks should bear me past all fear and sorrow
Merit the scorn they meet from little men .
To admit that his business in life is killing ,
The tears that change his earth to heaven ;
With life-long injuries burning unavenged ,
And in her place has come another ,
Moles of good-luck led me hither ,
My mallet served to knock me down ,
To raise a language , and his land reclaim
A power is gone which nothing can restore ,
Tried to catch the fire-intruder ,
That marked me first effort at selling a book .
Came to do tight rope and make trouble there .
_ as long i dwell on some stupendous
Yet many blessings come from wood ,
One symphony appear :
Here , for to make the face afraid ;
I snap the dead brown from the stem ;
Its life blood , where the wasted caravan sank .
Her feasts follow reason ,
The legend of an angel told ,
God ( so it runs ) made this world clean
It does not call to the contest -
Above his bivouac the firs fling down
How , urged by stress of any ill ,
And now comes in my happy hours ,
In hollow murmurs died away .
As the ugly face that man has got .
The deist sighed with saving sorrow ,
Hath refuge found , and baffled their pursuit :
On brazen steps the marble threshold rose ,
Low , sad , and sweet , whose measures bind
Some trivial present to my ships i bear :
As twilight o'er the landscape falls .
As his enquiring mind was taught ,
And made her streets a desert ; but thy soul
Which may perhaps a profit bring ;
Like petals of light fallen from the moon ,
A charm of charms combined .
Our house of life she filled ;
Yet such arrangement , rarely brought to pass
His garments breathed a spicy scent
To lift up our prayer ,
That pride contemplates with despair , }
A spirit came to me on the breeze
Garden-girt his fortress stood ;
To raise the siege unless some means be sought ;
In paradise would place him by his side .
Untouch 'd and sacred may these vessels stand ,
To give the breath to men ,
It is appointed that all flesh see death ,
To thee , perhaps , the fates may give --
Where the long june wave has run .
Through all my limbs a shudder ran ,
And , scattering flowers above and round about ,
With laugh that told the lightened heart ,
I think endymion released from sleeping ,
But follow my shadow that points the way home ;
Life is more heavy -- thy song says --
Shuddering to feel their shadow o'er thee creep ;
Would meet the coming foemen 's brunt ;
Satan , involved in rising mist ; then sought
The ancient knight , who still took little heed
Where wealth and luxury were seen ,
Who vainly reaches at the last reward ,
The riches of our state unfold .
Lest waking , he should struggle to be free
And loud applauses echo thro ' the field .
And hedgerows dripping oaks
But there lives another sound ,
And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice ,
From hopes long buried , by thy tender grace ?
Would echo the groans of despair ,
No belfries pealed for that pure birth .
And spend itself in sighs , for future scenes .
Drawn forth from a silvery brook ,
And of treasures brings a cargo . "
For though , while eyeing what beneath us lay ,
Their keeper . thus they rush on every crime :
The boat that bears the hope of life approach
How that will boot you time will teach . ”
While men might find distraction for their sorrows
When roaring snows rush down the mountain-pass ,
Who sprang for liberty once , found slavery sweet ;
Their thoughts rush into song ,
( where half new england came to gaze )
Spring may boast her flowery prime ,
And the new age forgets us and goes on .
The cart and oxen , drawing the holy ark ,
Trees mounted , and trees drooped , and trees
All through my veins there flows your blood ,
From the rivers rise , ye bowmen !
Seamed her tawny face with wrinkles .
And flowing words , might pity move , no power
( which therefore made them more devout ) ,
( a tale like jonah wrestling with the whale )
Like flowers that heard the tale of dews ,
The land spreads beaten by the billows wild ,
The patient term allowed
And made an end of him .
No pain such gentle vows could bring ,
But heaven to man , nor angel gives to scan
That out of gratitude he made ;
Few that his wayward memory linked with her .
He returned to join the snow-sledge ,
A breath were borne :
Dead are the lips where love laughed or sang ,
Fail 'd to place that master-feeling clear .
Each race has died and lived and fought for the
The fragrant wind , that through them flies ,
A fairy land my footsteps trod .
Now unto thee can manifest be made .
The wind fell dead with the midnight --
Being enamoured of a damask rose
But there the waves bound it , while all beside
Shoots shivering through his troubled brain ;
And as she folds her wings of mist ,
Forms of dim fear that grief has never named ;
I see that power is not in art ,
-- such thoughts bechanced to seize
That dies along the desultory breeze ?
And in the house she catch 'd a mouse
And with that cry i have raised my cry .
That drifted o'er the hill ,
It made me issue forth from my own mind .
And after april , when may follows ,
My ráma touched with deadly hurt .
But now to be made free .
In rapport with shy silence to make sound ;
Thine age at what a figure may we take ?
And scandal of our table , had returned ;
The narrow shadows hide . "
To you from failing hands we throw
When a storm hung low in the sky ;
A simple nymph it is , inclined to muse
Nor ever wind blows loudly ; but it lies
In vain we dwell on lines and crosses ,
Now in the fish some hearts may claim
Where , struck as by divine emotion ,
He spoke . the god who mounts the winged winds
To feel she has a faithful spouse --
Where the dark ivy 's seen to crawl ,
This clergyman laid what he found before
And kisses soft the shadow that it meets
The four seasons go on for ever and ever :
Where thames amongst the wanton valleys strays ;
Let the billows rise above it ,
And thus the weary night went on .
Thine own most precious gift we bring -- the light
You ’ve been leading us astray ,
Then the haze lifted . bombing on the right
Calling on the gods for succor ,
Silent it lay , or so i dreamed ,
And christmas that comes so near .
Whose lively features seem to breathe and move .
Let now the chimneys blaze ,
So shall her blows be shrewdly met ,
Thus at last the eagle catches
Their selfish ends they still pursue .
That lyre a pitying muse had given
Christ saw a wedding once , the scripture says ,
Or , if the fates control them , ruin huge
This slow perpetual time stand patiently ,
That skies and earth the flying sparkles fired ;
In grief swayed to and fro .
Burglars to rob the house laid wait .
Pitying , i dropped a tear :
We told , still question from each answer grew .
Battles with them so many brought to end ,
The axeman swings as the minutes go ;
That education gives her , false or true .
And gained his royal residence .
Make room for the marshal .
Whose circle of meridian covers o'er
In homage , made he as an instrument
Sleeping , was borne away by some strong spell ,
Her virgin nudity , goes whist
And draws it from its spotted shroud ,
The fault which lies direct from any sin
Waiting thy touch to make the waters roll
To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal .
As wrung from out the shattered heart , one groan
A wealthier tribute than to thine he gives .
Nor shivering fiend that hung on the blast ;
Make difference ? can violence to the good
Supplies another , lest the number fail .
And led me to review my life ,
All , hushed , attend ; his guiding words restrain
Let such conceale the evill hence they pluck
He looks like winter turn 'd to may ,
Her fame should flourish and her name be spread ,
And it stands in the light ,
Up hither like aereal vapours flew
For the ruin that he brought .
And hug them closer as the years go by ;
How sweetly from her lips they broke ! --
While banners wave aboon the brave
The rocky shore extended to the sea .
Shall warning signal come ,
And vengeance taken gave new cause of shame :
The close-jammed clouds then struggle to discharge
Born , the ulysses of thy age to rise
On the latch he laid his fingers ,
That broke on chaos , and the outward rush
A land that scarce knew prayer or priest ,
Ere yet the sixth long night was spent ,
At times their voices rang upon the air ;
Through his veins rushed courage warm :
And between females means no more than this --
Forced its mellifluous anger : --
Sweet rosebuds , springing from the tomb ,
Had made a miry channel for his tears .
All gone astray after the bad example !
Lust 's winter comes ere summer half be done .
Thus addressed the flame of ukko :
At his touch he felt new courage
When we breathe our evening prayer .
That fate should yet mean freedom ? howsoever ,
Which had ruled us from birthtime to meet
This precept then i sadly trace --
O , tell me before all is lost !
Still be linked with human lives .
Spirit of joy , thy altar lies
By caution ruled , the helm shall guide
And soon he found a brazen ring ,
The phrase his martyrdom hath made complete ,
And swept it along to the darkness ,
To miriam 's note of triumph sent
But came away more wretched than i went .
The strong life that never knows harness ;
Thou owest ! not alone these swelling tears ,
In silence lay the unbreathing wire ;
And now it holds the limpid light
The chapter listen vesper orisons ,
When albin her claymore indignantly draws ;
The silence and the solitude recalled
And gave consent to her straightway ,
The rose and black draws clear of the ruck ,
It is good to be homeward bound .
And rags near thee , some reverence may move .
Warm winds arise and sighing thence depart ;
And feared the active spirit , if it played .
Into the mist my guardian prows put forth ,
O eve ! thy sentence too she bore ;
Where every dream recalls that charming shade ,
To every sod , which wraps the dead ,
An arrow sped from some eternal bow ,
Let never word of pity pass your lips :
Were spread to bring back life again ;
That horrible hole ! -- it seems to say ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Nor can for mental heaviness their high study pursue ,
To promontories bounding a huge bay .
It can not lead to scenes more dark ,
What eye or thought can measure now
The magic all ran through .
Making the trees to tremble at his mourning ,
And over it gorgeous curtains fell
Which came in the beginning , was not changed ;
Oppression 's wrongs to fight .
That christ 's large charity can reach your sin ,
Though not without an uproar made by those
There to draw the till of barley ,
And dismal ruin seems to threaten it . "
Each christmas , carrying each some glimpse of home .
Is able to prepare thee to see christ . "
We felt that our luve lived ,
Everything beautiful centered in you !
The curtain cried for magnifies to see ! -
" he who brings my tears unto me ,
Where first my shipwrecked heart was lost ,
Religion only feigned to claim a share ,
Right to the isle of joy the vessels glide :
The cursed father then his bowels takes
Give him counsel against losing of that eden !
And in words like these expressed him :
Its lofty head it proudly rears
" my fainting spirit droops and dies away --
As the light clouds fly
And from a flower he takes his simple text .
I make one prayer to thee ,
Each with his gaze turned inward on some piece
I meet him wrapped in musings fine
Where air might wash and long leaves cover me ,
Her charm has loosed the chain it bound ,
Her happy soul now feels to be sublime .
I follow sadly to the magic rites .
When my heart is crushed with sorrow ,
But i can school my soul to strength ,
Does he study the wants of his own dominion ?
Will nought increase thy courage to indite ,
Of memories that stay not and go not ,
Then feed on thoughts , that voluntarie move
There he bears a frightful uproar ,
But soon his hopes are mixed with fears ,
Among the peaks that tower on high .
While the first brightness into wings unfolded ;
That clings among the tempest 's locks of bale ,
From every other longing was released .
Of branching beauty and white blooms of truth ,
For already he has reached the speeding raft ,
A thousand rills their mazy progress take :
For my soul is held in silence ,
The months i count : how long it seems
Xerxes , the libertie of greece to yoke ,
Where all the world might drop for italy
And where no wants , no wishes can remain ,
When the winds and rain are gone .
The sentence of thy early death contain .
By woe too great to bear .
And morning filled their cups with dew .
Her image comes into the gloom ,
The faint stars wake and wonder ,
And the world-spirit made her heart rejoice .
There swings the convent 's guiding-bell ,
Then at his words each heart and spirit glowed :
Break , and their toils be undone .
The sloping birchen tree and reached the roof .
Like pearl and gold , make one rich cabinet .
The same good order then was plainly seen ,
The last relief remains to thee to die :
Like arrows went those lightnings forth
And saints with wonder heard the vows i made .
_ infant voices passing . _
O what a sigh she gave in finishing ,
By the same hand that board and pieces made ?
Such pipes kept less of power to stir
A restless shadow through the chamber waving :
Straight to its mark the arrow sprang ,
As if they called for captured young , --
And give three cheers for the southern flag .
By raphael led : in sad and solemn strains ,
Kind friendship they will show to you ;
While thus they converse held , they chanced to stand
Made the moon and stars attend me ,
For pity do not this sad heart belie --
Horatius sent a blow .
She longed to meet her lord 's approving smile .
Breathed in frost , arose the still
And coursed along her pallid cheeks by day ,
And sorrow dwell a prisoner in thy reign .
A day of rain and roaring gutters
There balls of wildfire , there fly burning spears ,
And thou hast spent much time in talk with me
But mists on the silent winds were blown ,
Then fierce the rage of battle rose :
As now at this moment you stand . "
Fast sped the rushing chariot of the hours .
How do ye bind with silken claims ,
All give of prowess shining proofs and rare .
Filled with passion that knows no slaking ,
Of childhood and the happy hues it wore ,
Before the march of terror took their stand .
So in the dust the might of hector lay :
Nor yet to chance this happiness i owe ;
And merely tend to show how greatly love is
That stares in marble on the shrine above
I bear a banner in the strife .
Fill the dusk when the long day closes .
The ills which flow from this too prevalent complaint ?
Will it bear upward when my life is fled .
To bear your pain and worry , and those nights
Too hot they found the fare .
It shines in the night o'er my dreaming .
By the lightning 's flash betrayed .
Which to my ledger is transmitted ,
A thing which adam had been posed to name ;
And hence she lied , her heart persuaded throughly
Bearing your name to fill your place :
Instant , new life in the warm bosom plays ,
That we a useless memoir have displayed .
Whose soul the enemy bore away .
And when with power his proud heart swelled ,
But never an answer came from the wood ,
Which moves the heavens .
And take a little stroll among them there ,
Nor suffers horace more in wrong translations
Take warmth , and life from the glowing earth ;
Nor seek to draw them from their dread abode --
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . "
This tomb will never let thine honour sleep ,
Sir jeff ' ry now let loose a smile
A sea where never a ripple danced --
In having seen too much , the occasion lies ;
So come to the poet his songs ,
He made himself extremely sick ,
The will to do good that my efforts show .
Then instant to the glance each charm reveals ;
That came in neptune 's plea ;
The brave veloso takes the word with joy ,
Could i be cast where thou art not ,
My boat near land shows pleasure and surprise .
And tropic trees cast shade on every hand ,
Those endless joys were ill exchanged for these ;
And it makes his heart rejoice .
While panic struck their heavenly train ,
And in our path we left a trail of light
Of liberty extending her domain ,
Our dances broke and buzzed in knots of talk ;
Ere the sun sinks to repose . ”
What time the moon had gone to make
Follow your leader -- the rightful -- the royal !
His greedy thoughts on lands and castles ran .
Soft rings of smoke and weak scent wandering ;
My gazing soul would dwell an hour ,
Of that same temple have found rest :
Wherever i went such manners had disappeared .
Burn your very soul with shame ,
The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned .
And now at candie his full courage shown ,
Since christ his new commandment gave to men ,
But peter 's verse was clear , and came
You see the happy consummation of your wishing ,
The footpath by the doors winding its lifeless way !
Gathering swift kisses , touching breasts that leap ,
Such bliss as will last till we reach heaven ?
You could feel its granite fibres racked ,
And winter 's white mantle will cover the scene .
There came a flood of sweetest melody , --
A band of pilgrims leaned to rest :
To seek the good of souls from motives higher
Captivity led captive through the aire ,
Their friends retreat ; their foes pursue the rear .
Then salim smiled , and with his finger drew
Now lest what fell upon this thing .
How sweet on thy deep , heaving bosom to toss
Delight that was is grown disaster fell :
They scarce would find one champion good and true .
Keep my course from going wrong .
And many a fool that finds it sweet
That long has stood the rage of conquering years
To health and pleasure add a new delight :
_ and when the evening came he fell asleep ,
Though now inscribed " unknown " it takes
And has come past the stars of the lion ,
That lingers in the garden there .
A curious , eastern fragrance fills the breeze
Words dropped around me that the time was near
For there the kalif had hidden his wealth ,
How else , when every hope was fled ,
For five rounds more and gave no chance .
The festal warblings flowed ;
And fair proportion match ’d the ethereal race .
Seeming enraged , his beard the king doth tear .
To bring us news of the poor pilgrims there .
About the fire into a dance they bend ,
What sport shall we pursue ?
Endured , but all fled scatter 'd , seeing pierced
True to the promise her eyes gave ,
Upon that summer sea , had spread their sail .
Who widened all the bounds of life ,
White hamlets hidden in fields of wheat ,
Delights with greater rapture , when they come .
Many useless scruples vanish ,
That grandfather fell asleep to-day ,
Of intermitted usage ; then i felt
The sovereign power that rules the earth and sea ,
That makes the world around thee shine
Where the waterfall rings its silver bells ,
" will make thee know him at a glance ,
Oh , what a liberal power that made them thrive
The present lost , i found , aghast ,
And melancholy they return ,
But find a stay and comfort still .
Was saved by reeds that round it stood ,
They closed thee round , blinding thy blissful sight
Just kissed the lake , just stirred the trees ,
That all my sense in ravishment was lost .
Lay a forest , like a mantle ,
Fain would i waft such blessing upon thee ,
Take time to be holy ;
First taking words to our selves to declare
And by her subject waves is borne ,
My heart is strong to bear ;
_ i took a day to search for god ,
Foes declare that , at rehearsal ,
Courage i feel , abroad the world to dare ,
Valour and courtesy used to be found ,
And held lewd commerce with the suitor-train .
Was filled with magic , and the ear
The confidence of reason give ;
But he went on : -- an answer came ,
" the winter comes apace . "
And who commanded ( and the silence came ) ,
At once to give surprise ; and to delight .
There came into many a burgher 's pate
That the soul shares the body 's mortal doom .
One waiting thus , even as it comes to pass
Of that celestial music overwhelmed him ;
And the songs will never let me sleep .
Which claims no less the fearful than the brave ,
And heed not what the day will bring ,
For all that came -- though very hard
His own with such affection turned to her
Such prayers could never reach the worlds above ;
Who , tracking bygone years ,
The first voice that passed onward in its flight ,
't is hard to settle order once again .
Only made for me unhappy .
Which even up there unpleasant made its stench .
Is not the sweetest gift god gives his friend ;
Der hero has bound ,
The star that shook above the eastern hill
The king , light leaping to the ground ,
As a dream passes through the lands of sleep ,
And gave the name to us -- a right
Gazing we drifted toward that golden bloom
I feel my sunk heart ache ;
You know my feet betray my flight :
While all beauty lies asleep ;
In years that bring the philosophic mind .
And yields the essence purified for act .
The raving polka spins ,
That steep and narrow scale admits to climb .
Engulf the glories born of perfect love .
" in courage keep your heart ,
What have you brought but evil , and curses since
The veil of cloud was lifted , and below
The eternal calm to gain .
Grim , scarred bluegums ranged austerely ,
" our hearts have not so craven grown ,
Exquisite joys poured from pitchers of pain ,
Food that maketh the blood feel choice ;
And freedom without let or pale .
Of whom still sorrowing milan holds discourse ;
In double streams the briny waters glide .
Our simple statesman found his rule
Found in his old experience such an art ,
Virtue , that bears the sacred shield of truth !
Has made you like unto the little child ,
Gives more than female beauty to a stone ,
On the flying heels of june .
Till mingled ruin seized the wreck :
Give , give that precious boon to me
Aching on my knee it lay :
Their lies believed and mourned his much-loved son
A second pharaoh now o'er israel see !
And raised the murderous blow .
To follow time 's dying melodies through ,
That hearts are tangled in a golden smile ?
Upon the sun , and power was given to him
Till the faint air was troubled with the song
Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears .
And whom the evening 's kisses feminize ,
Laid up by saving sires ; the tribute sent
Another and a favour 'd place ;
That every hyacinth the garden wears
Lay on the soul and grow a passion .
Showed us the way the battle once had gone .
The whispering waves of darkness curled .
Out sprang the tepid blood of crimson stain ;
Thoughts that breathe , and words that burn .
In the home where passed my childhood .
Now thin mists temper the slow-ripening beams
The sun just shines on her old white head .
And seal the hushed casket of my soul .
Astolpho along trajan 's channel goes ,
Have brain and hearts , and feel and know .
The smile may return to my lips --
Tell me what has made thee angry ,
They had thus arranged the shares allotted ,
Odd facts that ca n't be passed :
Foretell new storms to those already spent .
The wind has driven me too many winters ,
The birch-trees swept in fragrant balm ,
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
How oft , when grief has made me fly ,
And being by satan blinded and urged on
Eyes her soft smiles reflected in the air ;
Might claim the breath i shape to prayer .
With their youthful sweetness take me ;
The mournful tokens which convey
Of bronze and porcelain set to snare ,
I 'd creep into the lost and ruined hearts
But different scenes rise horrid to my view ,
How can an answer be given ?
Where england 's chivalry are met ,
Would make me glad , and in the evenings then
Hath naught that lies as near this rest
Towards a neighbouring vale , whence came the sound ,
Fate gave the word , the arrow sped ,
Doth it not mark some body changed to clay ?
Called forth the reaper 's rustling noise ,
And the shuttle cease from throwing ? '
And not a thought of vengeance had survived .
And the gates of brass are broken .
So every year that falls with noiseless flake
And there it found two broad-brimmed hats ,
Where airy voices lead : so through the hollow ,
Freshness to feel the eternities around it ,
Saw the smoke arise to heaven ,
My tears and sighs are given
The vexed pulse of this feverish world ,
See if thou canst pay the tribute ,
And her lips were touched with wonder ,
But to us comes no cheering ,
Which at once mocks and makes all poesy .
Parried or swallowed searching questions rude ,
Nor heat could melt , nor beating storm invade .
To meet ye , mighty were the love that sought
Thinks that his puny arm can cope with time ;
Lasts , though all the worlds lie waste
And brilliant figures suddenly fill the darkness ,
As malice cease in their dark souls to burn ,
What fortune most denies we slave to take ;
Loud as the crashing thunder sent
Where melancholy sits with eye forlorn
Who marked by grief and pain a visage wore .
And fixed his pindus upon lebanon .
" for beauty , here , a mother seeks .
As doors and windows bared to some loud sea ,
Ye 've gave to me a broken heart ,
To leave me lonely as before ,
Me agamemnon urged to deadly hate ;
Still perfect ; yearly is the pageant ranged .
As night is withdrawn
Only concern 'd to take her full delight .
But vanish 'd is the shade so gay ,
Streamed the moonlight through the valley ;
Give me words wherewith to woo ,
Which elles scholde noght arise ;
Death , and his image rising in the brain ,
We will make time , love ,
Wealth , my lad , was made to wander ,
When your time comes . how years slip on !
The silent organ had received
In beauty grows :
O give my lance to reach the trojan knight ,
His course wherein no crookedness is found --
A spectre this from which all shrink afraid .
" midnight comes , and all is well !
Till there break from passion of the human
But kept their words to ponder in her heart .
Your symmetry was borne before its time ,
The love that lived through all the stormy past ,
How silent comes the water round that bend !
On such a time as this i find
To quench the flickering light and play ;
" midnight comes , and all is well !
But when they light upon immediate death ,
The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray ;
And the violin weaving the waltzers a story ,
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers ;
How doth death speak of our beloved , 72 .
Whom the sea swallowed one day . "
The glorious steeds our ready arms invite ,
Pompless no life can pass away ;
With winds that in their boyhood blew ;
But dora bore them meekly . then before
What the message thou art bringing ?
Spirit , substantial form , with matter join 'd
That ever since in love 's embraces met ;
Shivered and driven from their ghostly shores ,
And night from hence prefer to draw its day ;
There was a maiden who went astray ,
Come the time that i had wished for ;
In spring they lie one broad expanse of green ,
The trembling queen ( the almighty order given )
How beautiful they stand !
He passed forth sorrowing : and anon ,
That all my sense in ravishment was lost .
I got the funniest bank --
And spend their fury , and then pass away ,
He bade his dream in the rock expand --
To rake the heart of lucifer .
Were strangely intermingled . hours would pass
Spirits dried up and closely furl 'd ,
The strand was bathed with golden light ,
He for a future snare doth lightly spread .
Go on , for thou hast chosen well ;
Unto its hateful heading : _ killed _ .
And he who pays true loyalty to that
Although a friend in thee they view ,
The thought that conscience must embrace ,
Moving unto the words their little flames .
And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess ,
Many the days that winter keeps in store ,
When the sweatin ' troop-train lay
Lifting against me , pouring through me , here
But being spent , the worse and worst
It looms beneath the moonlight o'er the trees
And the web of years be spun ;
I think the honey guarded with a sting ;
To drown your feeble rays , a joyous fire .
With the lurking drop of blood that lies
To save the lord the trouble .
The foremost to affront the raging fight ?
And my heart that was bruised and broken
And as he speaks the tears descend in dew .
Whence jarring discord hath assail 'd it thus ? "
Of glorious deity they laid aside .
Spoke aloud the words that follow :
Man 's coltish disposition asks the thong ;
A knowledge greater than grief can dim , --
And left the couple neither gay perhaps
How happy days are made to be ,
Thou hast left a glorious pledge ,
So we 'll make a mellow hour :
And grateful science heaves the heartfelt sigh !
Our earth hath then contracted stench and rot .
There arose a great contention ,
These savage peoples , while the standards lost
Thine earth now springs , mine fadeth ;
That grief itself possessed me . time would pass ,
A willowy brook that turns a mill ,
Were anarchy , that precision which is felt
And draws the spirit most unto itself ,
And sin 's corroding power must fly .
The stolen fire of a demigod ,
And judgment , wearily sad , may see
The prize he gave , himself resumed ,
And turn his merry note
Could venture for the golden fleece
And its root bears fruit for ever .
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore ,
And find it easy as forgetting oaths !
Thy golden gate that stands
His holy and sweet wave ; his course shall guide
Only god , who gives perfumes ,
That can bring thee to destruction ,
Her breast with sleep arise and fall . the silence
And his face is blanched , and sorrow sits
To give account of deeds done in the body .
Are like the hopes i built in youth , --
It 's coming to know that she never knew why
And took the ring , and there awhile did stand
Had not night , trailing heavy-folded mist ,
Or is it but a bloom i see ,
And the hand of the frost spreads stark and numb
Red underlip drawn in for fear of love ,
And joy and hope around him smiled .
There they lay in wait for kwasind ,
Which from love 's fire took heat perpetual ,
Where hermit saints their dwelling make .
As your health or comes or goes ;
And throbbed , as where an ardent bird has clung
Yet i believe the clouds dispersed a little
Hunger there , and fell starvation ,
A nightmare gave her a fright .
Pondering long no cure could find .
Go summon israel to flight -- take this
And made the streams as the streams of hell .
Over the face of the leader came ;
Where cares long since have shed untimely snow ,
When consciousness came back , he found he lay
Of shadowy headlands doomed to stay the storm ;
Kitty 's seventh season has brought sufficient reason ,
Where no pain or sorrow enters ,
What hinders for the homeless here to gain
It will come to such sights colder
Dear human minutes , marred by human pains --
Let cool the friendship : one in foreign parts
Orlando to the ruffian made reply :
Content with javelins to provoke the war .
But when death 's night is dying away ,
They gave due notice that it soon should fall --
I feel as only woman can .
The vital flame , and swells the genial seeds .
And simple pleasures that always please ;
And dealt them pitying justice still , as though
With fearless candour told her all .
Where it follows the turn to the west !
Waters that hissed disaster reared upright in our path .
Buy him fo ' her slave , you see ,
So the captain made his test ' ment ,
Thanks for the sympathies that ye have shown !
Of doom inexorable , while the struck city
Of his own band that followed in his rear ;
" onaway ! my heart sings to thee ,
That made the great caves ring ,
And made it seem the teacher 's reprimand
And when desire with eager looks is led ,
Of conflagration , rolling floods of flame .
Cauld blew the bitter-biting north
With fevers brought from sultry climes ,
It trembles into death ; yet comes anon
It haps an image this is seen to do ;
The wreaths of smoke that circled there ,
To mark the mutual kindling eye .
Turned his glances to the north-west ,
When science taught mankind to breathe
And left it pale as death ; as flowers unfold
By some prophetic feeling taught ,
Fire to stay the chill at night ,
The breath of eve is gathering bleak ,
The hours crept up and slipped away ,
I to thy maker all the glory give .
To those she-fiends his speech addressed :
Lest i should learn to lay my faith
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow ,
Every hour was winged with gladness
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood ,
In such ditties pleasure find ....
Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword ;
The panting cattle lave their lazy feet ,
Foller , folly , _ to follow _ .
His numbers raised a shade from hell ,
Alone it stands in poesy 's fair land ,
There lay the narrowing channel , smooth and grim ,
And over each pane like a fairy crept :
A thoughtful mind in question thus may dwell ;
Rich , languid charm would cast enchantment o'er
' thy secret pleasure turns to open shame ,
Which yonder kindly willows threw ,
It takes no spot , but still refines ;
What is the burden to be borne for thee ?
Only to leave me as it found me ;
Where conquest waits their hardly purchased chance ;
His gathering ire could phlegyas scarce contain .
To weigh the myths that they professed ,
No later light has lightened up my heaven ,
For a superstitious story kept 'em back ,
Choosing such portion as their minds may suit .
Our voices choke with sobs to-day ;
And make themselves incredibly unwell . )
Our days will pass in calm delight .
It writes along the weeks its song ,
Sunk is the hero , and his glory lost !
On the smooth lands went nimbly up and down ,
Where the sole phoenix doth revive , not die ,
But the night was torn with gashes --
Shall comfort your declining years !
Till through these limbs the life shall flow ,
As never eye created saw its rising ,
" let the only walls the foe shall scale
Watch , that nor lion nor beast come nigh ,
With their fiery breath made answer :
Olympian hymns receive the escaping soul ,
Their glancing armour flashed about their limbs .
Where time began and history shall close .
't is said he made some quaint old rhymes
Who comes to sorrow o'er the dead ,
Through shades that frowned and flowers that smiled ,
The dame who chose my lot to share ?
Conceal from every scornful jest that flies ,
Of stirring branches , and the bud which brings
And night blackness lurking in the ceiling beams .
An ' the best we may go wrong ,
The old year went , and the new returned ,
To shake the iron hand of fate
Pray let us take the air , "
And led him where the shadows cast
Seeing the game from him escapt away ,
My pregnant wit shall shun all future blame ,
The shepherd 's face in sadness grew :
Open it , and hear it tell ,
The cloud in the west would bring foul weather .
Bring action for assault and battery ,
Which whatever his deeds , ordained them still ,
And who knows how long sad heart keep ? "
And in it so much poison lies concealed ,
The morning stars the treble led
Through many days they toil ; then comes a day
For them we fill to be our fates .
How has his daughter leaped to womanhood !
Its voice came to us issuing from the school !
This city bodes no common fate --
Who in good actions takes delight ,
That make glad the hearts of nations ;
Like a clear spring of joyance bubbling up
Inviolate the spirit whence it sprung !
Of powers and pleasures ? let it try .
An ambush hoped , as heartless night remain .
Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air .
Till it reached at last the ocean strand ,
Achieve and flame ; and found them in some moods
At length upon the sand that drank
Until his day came when he died ,
The iron fetters yield .
Patrons of pleasure , posting into pain !
Tall as a hill that cleaves the sky ,
And the sea whitens with the rising gale ,
Made answer , saving with a piteous sigh ;
Whose shadowy glory resting on the pall ,
And those amorous sweets that lie
Take on , _ to sorrow _ .
That is founded on truth :
Passed o'er our village as the morning broke ;
Before she made a plan for life again .
A cloud had settled on my heart --
Like winter greens , that flourish all the year .
And his maladies hatched in gloom ;
Three peaceful years slipped silently away .
A good two hundred thousand came ,
The rival candidates growled and came to blows .
What best may for the present serve to hide
How far a figure ought to go ,
My mind dictated . moments rolled away -
Then may these shoulders cease this head to bear ,
And fainting , sink into decay .
An english hearth and devon 's waving trees .
And the storm has ceased to blow .
Its pain on earth ere yet my life had grown
To chase the misty terror .
That lingers in the garden there .
Shall nature cease to bow ?
Which on the grassy ground he laid
And thus with thought mature the monarch said :
So the white czar imperial progress made
Love rarely lasts for a year ,
Deep in thy steadfast soul it lies ,
And that , protected by the ceaseless fall
O life is delight when june is come .
The melody upon clear strings inflected
But fools do live and waste their little light ,
And boasting that rebels must shortly knock under ,
So maggie runs , the witches follow ,
A wind makes dance the fine acacia leaves
She shares her abode with no one ,
Around , around , flew each sweet sound ,
Its explanation found !
Kindled , thy ken a higher flight shall mount ;
In the arms of ages past to lie ;
To catch one sweet throb mair .
't is virtue that must bind it fast ;
Marlowe . english players brought marlowe 's work back to
Too gauntly glared the coming day .
That ark of grace , ordained to bear
And now the music means " forget , "
The morn has come , and where are they ?
When the humid shadows hover
But why came the soft embowment
Thus ever guided by the men of france .
To build your prosperous lot ,
Black piers with crust of dripping green ,
That never gives -- tho ' humbly takes enough ;
Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty ,
Sharpening , and solemn and terrible words ,
The smoke scarce dies where the trail camp lies ,
And ran him for vice-president .
Where the high trust is fixed on truth alone ,
And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected ,
That made the wilderness more lonely ;
And makes those eyes , where life should dwell ,
And hence it takes the nature of a substance .
Some , rhymes to make on one that died ;
A bitter cry the maiden gave
So trusting , back the mourner flew ,
Crusader-like , to her assistance go .
The blaze died into a glow of coals .
Now dimmed and gone ,
Art dreams of such divinity .
Like faery music , heard at midnight , came .
What empires start up , or what kingdoms decline .
There were but three that struggled not to die :
Of patience , bring them sooner to their goal ,
The fleet , with idle canvas hung ,
Thou place thy trust ; let not the entrance broad
And when the spell was spoken through ,
When age might well have chilled his blood . '
The shadow drew , and pointed at the breast
May show worse railing than our lady eve
The rolls of fame i will not now explore ;
They look towards prussia and dissolve in tears ,
The river spread her waves around
Till on his life the sickness weighed ;
It felt that he was near !
Half the long weary night has gone ,
A decent fortune they had made ;
Whose lonely columns stand sublime ,
Came weariness , and all things other passed
Turns to the right , resolved to worship , where
In parts superior what advantage lies ?
Flame out with sorrow and yearning love .
As death had sealed her malcolm 's doom ,
Since never of thy sin it found ?
Coming with the bitter chill that marks the death
Within , the lightest hearts that ever beat
The sun came through the frosty mist
First answered their entreaty , and the blood
The indian village stood ;
Could ever into foolish wanderings get .
And thus the end comes swift and sure ...
That makes _ one _ of many , many ,
Holding to ancient nobleness ,
His godlike fury startled from amaze .
Where once some pleasant hamlet stood ,
The order gives to bring a book before it ,
O , that like the flower he tramples ,
The blood of heroes runs its race !
Like breakers dashing on a rock-bound shore .
Where king corn 's armies lie with flags unfurled ,
To win her grace whom all commend .
Wide yawned his chest ; blood issued from his mouth
Drew down her starry veil and sank the sun .
I found permission with the proper one ,
Of him by whom the universe was stretched .
And night came down over the solemn waste ,
Pealing from clouds that canopied my life ,
The words divine had raised in her , she passed
Than youth conceal 'd in thine .
And his feet passed over the sunset land
Tired by the breath which i respire ;
It is building a dream ;
Hath found the road by tears and prayers
One look he cast , forgetting for the time
In the portuguese language various meanings are attached to the
Of secret grief unseals the fruitful source ;
One gives the signal , -- all the jovial crew
And honest lived -- though small the profits made .
I 've heard it said that he
Sorrow stands in a wide place ,
Which joyous set out with its message of love ;
The sun comes forth and like a god
And pray that all the good gods follow thee .
On some important business went in haste ,
And when some rounds demand a rest ,
That would protect the land a thousand years ,
The sea was calm , your heart would have responded
Five scimitars , wi ' murder crusted ;
They see how spirit comes to light ,
Win your daughter 's young affections .
Sins must be broken off by righteousness ,
Grass , and the sky where many colours blend ,
Saw how his parent gave the giant strength .
All in her tribe would rise and mourn
Here in radiant courses go ,
With you their watches keep .
Setteth my heart with joy aglow ,
To whom the angel , with a smile that glowed
Rinaldo 's sister 's heart is softened so ;
Your wages run from day to day ,
I hid my heart in a nest of roses ,
My mind dictated . moments rolled away -
And in his waters , which your mirror make ,
Then , as both felt in very kindly mood ,
Love-time would bring me back to you
And take whatever pity they may dole .
Death 's portrait true ? the tyrant never sat .
My skill the grain shall gather from the tares .
To his ear there came a murmur
Not heard the name scorn coupled with her own ;
There saw she direst strife ; the supreme god
Arysing forth to run her mighty race ,
Seemed trembling with delight to bear ;
But angels come to lead frail minds to rest
Has mingled with the funeral knell ;
Smile stars , that reigned at my nativity ,
But rollant felt that death had made a way
The curling billows roll their restless tide ;
As her chaste girlhood , never lost ,
Came the mournful story .
Be left to add our gain to gain ,
The serpents flashed and gripped him fast :
And there lies gude sir patrick spens ,
` to balance the advantages he missed ,
The hollow murmurs of the winds that blow .
The face of morning , wavering windy sheets
Many a jest told of the keys betraying
Breathe out life 's expiring sigh , --
Where the sky rests , a visible wall .
There , with rapture sorrow leaves the breast , --
To feel no other breezes than are blown
On -- the spirit circled gently ,
Amidst the sweetest garden was she laid ,
The history of this battle wants authenticity .
Self ceased , and anger into pity died ;
The wind , as it strikes the sand ,
The sorceress from their furious vengeance fled .
Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted :
Although lamps burn along the silent streets ,
Let neither flattery soothe , nor pity hide .
One saw the symptoms of a bat
That mocks the threat of winter near ,
Wherein men gain a little rest from toil .
In the stern made haste to seat him ,
Which better may his labor satisfy .
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high .
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain . "
He quenched among the bubbling blood ,
The market glutted and his counted profits naught .
That bears towards damascus ; and to a knoll
And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet .
And peace like this shall cheer your way .
Even the cold wind is seeking a new mistress .
For love 's attire my leaves are shed .
Ere yet that month its course had spent ,
A budding star , that might have grown
The bird builds love towards heights ethereal !
One hue of our flag is taken
Their golden fruited boughs , that made
Green glimmering forest of the grass shines down ,
That only serves to make us grieve
I looked above ; and heaven in mercy found me
The sins i can not count ,
A gloomy scowl the count 's eye filled :
And southward from the land their course they bore .
No nightly seas swirl in grey agonies ;
Below to join the lively clan :
And let quick death beat down my failing tent ,
Where none do fishes take ;
Where fewer offerings burn , and fewer kneel ,
While time allows , my sudden fate ,
I loved antonio , but i kept me pure ,
Thou whom the prayers of an empire defend ,
To set red lips unto that fruit
( in lucian is the story told )
With none to make afraid .
Spirit were seeing . " what means this uncivil
A nation 's anger is by losses stirred ,
On his that felt as midnight rise
Rush up into the mind and master it ,
Together make a zone of the horizon ,
And now there came both mist and snow ,
Whose helm confess 'd the lineage of the man ,
But now my strength is well nigh spent ,
The lion thus his message said : -
Then ráma nobly calm allayed
From my charm 'd heart the numbers sprung ,
My warrant is gone out , though dormant yet ;
So fair , and yet it breathes of pain .
And never stops at ; where the skies extend
Till the chops will not lie still , but walk
There ran up the trees a confused hissing sound ,
When man to man gave willing faith , and loved
Draws the devout , deterring the profane ,
While the sad south in whispering breezes sighed
For men to use their fortune reverently ,
Youth passes , unredeemed they lie ;
That curse on báli sorely pressed ,
But i struck one chord of music ,
Yet profit none of all their sorrow found .
With half the bliss , takes all the blame ;
Misty light , shot through with gleams
I find it useful every day ,
No longer the warfare ungodly would wage ;
In safety lead them , where the other crag
On toiling , beating pinions , fly ,
Of all my suitors follow to his home
Alert to snatch and publish hour by hour
She gave me love who only asked for death --
Simplicity lost , and frugality flown .
Brought that deep look of anguish ,
When called before their judge to stand ,
To make it a dance of dignities ,
Hearts bow down , hands falter ,
Of loud mirth that scorneth measure --
For of our little boy it tells .
With better fortune may maintain the fight .
And genius soars unbounded to the skies !
The hasty blood in guilty red would speak
What palette ever held the flaming tints
Where time enters not with his hours ; --
Such a glance that lusts go after ;
Where life seemed spent in happiness serene ;
And destitute of means to raise themselves ,
The hungry night that lay in wait without
' what 's making billy fight so dead ?
Grows from such sorrow as theirs !
Eyes of hours whose paces halt or quicken
Three , turning pain to honey-sweetness , said
Across the atlantic wave , where slaughter stood ,
The port held desolation more
Which gives out flame , yet it its whiteness shines
The flowery spring leads sunny summer ,
And budding hopes may never dare to grow .
When sculptor 's art transforms it into life --
Though happiness around thee lay ,
Although the wall shows through him -- and the khan
The fault committed while you were away ?
Pointing to worlds where hope is free from blight ;
The loud evangel , that proclaims the secret
To and fro our restless natures sway ;
Would be sure to take cold in tears .
To the music the banded bees make him
The angry visage of the phantom wore ,
And darting down the valley flies :
While silence waved her sceptre
How soon my lucy 's race was run !
To make believe that thou art gone ?
I held as one who goeth reverently .
Only to yield thee gladness of my voice ,
Where kisses mix with laughter ,
Of the grace given him by his holy guide
The stars sing a message elusive and sweet .
And crocus heavens had fed
Cries are heard to let them pass .
Before her breath went . after that , instead
The good and evil to discern .
A rose will hold ,
The haws hung slips of fire ;
But his heart was heavy and like to burst .
The love that 's ordered to bathe in wine ,
Anxious for troy , the guard the natives keep ;
Might not the sharp bows overwhelm ;
That makes me so digress ?
She , from the rending earth and bursting skies ,
He knew the lesson nature gave ,
If france was beat at waterloo --
A nectar we were saving for the soul ,
When genius , beauty , in his circle ran ,
Victorious he his mighty triumph holds ,
From the rattlesnake we learnt to guard our rights .
By me , their gifts of blossoms laid .
Each feels the bliss of all destroyed ,
As the stained stones kissed by the english dead .
Which tells me , youth 's no longer here !
Where perhaps some beauty lies ,
I fain my griefs would cover ;
Whom burning fires of grief distressed :
If from the fashions of the world set free ,
Her adorable head that arose ;
As a wild wind their branches swept .
Hither bring but truthful measures .
The care of kings and power of empires stand ,
Of the high altars , and led to practices
His words went like a cold wind through their flesh
The glad earth smiled beneath a smiling heaven ,
When pity to resentment did succeed ;
For having used their appetites so sadly .
Yet turning saw the fearful coil had sunk
In wisdom 's paths content to stay ,
His drowsy lids snap at some trivial sound ,
Our pipes make sport to shorten weary night :
And till he can find matter for his tears ,
That vainly shall the cunning toils be spread .
And sickly nothing ; suddenly seized on her ,
Time that had marked him for the least of sages
In which the power of satan broken is :
Exchange of powers of this conflict came ;
All sounds to silver rhythm ran :
To freedom 's duty giving ,
Let it rest there through three sunsets ,
The colours it forgets .
Then from the south arose a gentle breeze
Your pleasure filled our day with bliss ;
There lives the dearest freshness deep down things ;
From the old tower the hours fall heavily
For the dark pine that kept
But none brought out that cloying sense of glee
Though rashness can hope for but one result ,
Their power abused ! that power may soon descend :
My second first arose ,
Old ghosts , no time shall lay ,
The cross his covenant displayed ,
The moon has waxed fierce and waned dim :
And ere bright titan half his course had run ,
Then shall war 's signal unto us be given --
Ruin will doubtless follow fast .
To put a foe to flight is all
Their fainted courage , and dispel 'd their fears .
-- and so it often runs astray
The mystery was cleared .
As bright as morning when she broke , --
Might well make _ twice _ six thousand years appear
Led by love 's soft endearing charms ,
And they rise up in glory ? early grief ,
A desperate grief , that finds no cure .
A flush that spoke him loath to die --
Thy loving heart our needs has met ,
And music , went to camelot :
Of virtue set along the vale of life ,
And both may after all turn out untrue .
Lost in the golden light of latter days .
And blazed with newer courage to its aid ,
Not the gross act alone employs her pen ;
Whose aid might turn the battle from his van :
And heaven regard me as i justly swear !
To awe-struck silence grown ;
Thro ' which the sounds came floating took away
And sullen murmurs through the comrades ran :
Weareth that form , which influence of the soul
These make the true religiousness of speech .
From her folded lap the sunbeam slid ;
He , whose transcendent wisdom passes all ,
Before thine eyes the new sun stood .
Truth yet holds the better course .
The time flies quickly as our friends draw near
He came for the third heat light-hearted ,
Piercing the shadows of the noontide gloom
For ony wife i see .
Now left a prey on latin soil to lie
Then the deep grave , who shares my reverie ,
The counsel , and his purpose stayed .
Waves of blue heat that wash midsummer sky ;
There underneath , not made by torments sad ,
Tyrants fall in every foe !
Of melody is floating round --
Then heed his will , and be our journey made
Whose lamp of life no longer shine :
The irish church question 's resolved to a t ;
Comes with the language of the bees ,
Whose wondrous virtue is , to show
Looked , and saw the sun was sinking ,
What ruin comes where he hath been --
In whom god 's judgments to regret give rise ?
Had taken on the beach her lonely stand ;
And of one beauty many blunders make ;
But joy shall come with early light .
For death , be sure would follow fast . ”
So contracted her conscience , illiberal her notion ,
The new ship comes nearer and nearer ,
It made my curls hang slack
Yet was his impress fastened on the race ,
Rumour on rumour rushed across the sea ,
Of romans , rising from the trojan line ,
The news went round in the camp that night ;
Gray dreams are set in the weaver 's sight ,
Then we shall turn us home again to life
That flooded her soul with love --
Is laced with violet flame .
The eternal rose shall cover
Yesterday 's wounds , which smarted and bled ,
That never a heart in my bosom stirred ,
And nodding forests to the numbers danced , ]
We 're falling back from the gomal
That has a hundred hands which take no bribe .
Unto the flame my heart hath lit ,
Answered him in words that follow :
The sun sinks now below this hopeless sea ,
Freedom asks your common aid , --
That madest me follow glory 's theme ;
Long sought by sacrifice and prayer . ”
To meet the morn with beams so bright ?
't is to give us love and beauty ;
With whirring wings a wild duck sprang to sight
Then fall beneath the pagan king , ivoire
The singing waters run ;
The lagging minutes , counted with their strokes .
That half the year the nostrils would keep lent ,
But a double life was the life he led ,
Give wealth to our summer and spring .
Sadness came into the cabin
Divine the growth such seed and soil will bring .
Before men piped them from their lonely ways .
It came with a mighty power ,
And make full many a bitter pill go down .
Tuition with fun is combined ;
Let our sorrows go sleep awhile ;
The attorney to his duties swore ,
Is to existence brought ;
Sweet food and fair -- hiving the beautiful ,
Which adds such honour unto thy chivalry ?
Breath coming short as in a convert 's prayers ,
So mary wore in hopes and fears away .
Are rising before my raptured gaze .
The current of life runs ever away
In this his universal temple hung
Fierce , round achilles , rose the boiling wave ,
Ere thus i have lain couched an hour ,
An olive branch before me lay ,
Why are the lilies flecked with red ?
Resolved to take his chance what came to hand ,
Time that made us and will slay
To drink of that which makes the bosom burn ,
And discord here has lit her brand ,
Of hearts surrendered and of souls redeemed .
A rose renewed with red new life begun ,
To chase injustice with revengeful arms :
With hatred filled and passion 's fiery heat ,
Thus nature works as if to mock at art ,
Sae comes of ignorance i trow ,
Firmly she made denial ; together came to her
To turn their wits and win their votes .
He made the sign of the cross and stood ,
These three alone lead life to sovereign power .
From life 's slim , twisted tendril and there swung
Than wealth that in his chamber lies ,
In vain . the solemn silence falls ,
His ugly evil in others ' good to hide ;
The darkened heavens , and down a deluge pour .
I 'll not , while sunny ages go ,
It chilled his soul and marred his frame ,
Not theirs ' neath tyranny to bow ;
And dried sad eyes till theirs lost light ;
Submissive , still adoring may we stand
The roman epic originates in the imitation of the
Yet touched with awfulness of light poured out .
No loud burst of thunder followed ,
And ' neath its dank oppression wasted low .
That hid the languid fire within her eyes ,
She thought upon the years gone by ,
Where hungry waves crept up the sand .
Ah , my heart with grief will burst .
If our colors are struck and the fighting done ?
Give your gladness to earth 's keeping ,
And reason broke what passion formed .
There comes a day for grief 's overwhelming shower ,
And barely reached the bank .
The prudent chief gave order to his son .
That only comes when least the need :
What god 's approving word hath sealed :
To shed the light of holy dreams
How merrily it goes !
But aye pressed on , like lions chasing sheep .
Seeking the road to bliss --
The illuminated manuscripts , that lay
And swallowed in one storm , for further grief ,
Thy kindred appellation comes , and who ,
To shun the shafts no life could bear .
The curled white clouds went slowly marching ....
That toilsome path led up to god .
They soon make lightsome room .
This way it passed : the scent lies fresh ;
The broken bird fed from her hand of pity .
When all the love we watered with our tears
But they no longer give me pain .
Where the envious curses fly ;
It was left for the rebels ' learning ,
He said , and straight his weapons took
And from the beasts that made escape ,
With mighty jerks that set the shadows shifting ,
Held nothing but one vacant place ,
Shall liberty follow
O , fill his heart with joy .
New courage there their swelling hearts did fill ,
His wretched life for sin shall pay . ”
" sweet my love , i take no care ,
Some milder joys may come , like thee ,
Great was the noise through all that country went .
Bring sad thoughts to the mind .
Than : ' i for joy will follow .
Such close attention had his tale received ,
Were her faint tones that thrilled upon my ear .
But no sweet bird did follow ,
Of such delights so easily made heir ?
Than any wreath that man can weave him .
And whom the world had not yet taught ,
And in immense perdition sinks the soul .
An ' turns on me a solemn face ;
Her musical shall ever touch
To lose in life the cherished friend ,
His homage to the hermit paid .
Through nerbune passes the victorious host ,
In tears our last farewell was taken ,
And the wind sighs it as it flies away .
Their mantle dark , the grisly shadows spread ,
For to sing and make good cheer ,
Lit the clouds . no message came
A day of death the stormy future brings ;
What ' er you leave the grave will take ,
Send our spirits down to zero .
The peace rejected , but the truce obtain ’d .
For the hideous trance is fled ;
Only the snows of twenty winters run ,
Together , in the drifts that pass ,
Or in a garden leaning above corinth ,
Now it glows ' neath summer 's kisses ;
With spirit regained , and again were joined
On all his steps the gloom of sadness hung ,
While patient heaven holds off the woeful fate
Lordship of earth ; and i made prayer ,
In vast crescendo , swept the human cry ,
And faith that never failed !
And more and more now melts his wavering mood ,
And the north wind driving right :
That they feel no slightest evil ,
All flooded with the helpless wrath of tears ,
Since sorrow never comes too late ,
Here nature resides -- nothing human is seen ;
Where the tip of the rainbow reaches
My heart is resting , o my , 89 .
Little sorrows sit and weep .
And on each branch doth sit a lazy mist ,
Time had gone but little distance ,
Savage and shrill ! but with the breath which fills
Where valor rests
Life in sublimer life called loyalty . "
What made the ball so fine ?
That skipped and chased each other merrily
He sat and smiled and watched his spirits play
Sounds of great joy , too beautiful to bear ;
Which the calm and quiet hills surround ,
Till passengers shall spend their doom :
Which hope too long has whispered . so i sought
Is scarcely set and the day is far .
Makes her an idol , and her praises sings
The art of making money ; and he found
Fill my soul with trust unshaken
No answer came to any strain ,
And on palm sunday bore his bough of green .
Death enters not , nor strife nor pain ; --
Which he kept for battle and days of need ;
To form the manners of our youth ,
And with cheeks as white as the ice they lay
More steadfast as the shape shone through --
While the big black spider gave a yell .
To make him think it merely was a joke !
Before the sun rose , made the city bright ,
Into my heart silence and winter came :
Each thought of me that comes o’er thee
But to us comes no cheering ,
As that your kisses must outvie the stars .
They filled the darkness when the dauber woke ;
Twice again , and the lark will rise
Hell turns to heaven , the unclean purifies ;
And a great silence fell
Of night , that closed upon his radiant path ,
And have even found the grace
Love from all sin my soul will free :
The duties which shall spring from such a seed ,
In silence feel the dewy showers ,
Where once the starry heavens looked down ,
One look , one pitying look , i cast .
The hosts of darkness hide their face .
Old-world traditions fail to bind .
Whose flickering splendors , like soft rainbows , fell
And find there is no rival like the past .
The rich ripe fruit that hung so temptingly .
The ploughman from the sun his season takes ;
Murdering the livid hours that grope for peace .
Still serving through the bleakest day ,
He strove to silence rising feud ,
Sweet welcome with her smile to give ,
The young year sets the buds astir ,
Within this soil the social virtues live ,
Trumpet and clarion join the mystic noise ;
And the lonely of heart is withered away ;
Music lets fall from her fingers .
While the horizon holds the day imprisoned . "
Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows ;
A cloud opaque , and ( so tradition tells )
Our eyes fixed steadfast on the shore beyond ,
No such contents as crowns and sceptres yield ,
And all about us pealed the nightingale ,
The sails were set , and the oars kept tune
It does into malice grow .
No nearness but in silence lay
But now was coupled new in marriage yoke ;
Revenge on him that made me stop my breath .
That slew our sorrow and healed our care . "
And makes uneasier many a throne ;
Dark and silent bearers draw , then , nigh !
Its hull scarce peering through the night of clouds ,
Light of ancient suns which set
And by all means for his deliverance meet ,
Who for the roman empire rests the spear ,
Men who have life and grace to give ,
Mother 's spirit came and spoke to me ,
Then mrs. taylor gave a shriek
The nations fell ; and the great babylon
I tie the shadows safe from gliding back ,
Where have they gone ? the shrill winds pass ,
Subdue my sins and give me rest .
That shone as heavens light ,
Had sunk into its victim 's heart !
She joined her hands and prayed the same ,
It hath tones of clearest gladness ,
My offer stands . as hubert 's wife , "
And in your joyous errand reach the spot
His lectures both so much transcended ,
When the fresh winds make love to flowers ,
The other sealed it with a kiss ;
And i catch the toll that follows
And when the summer came again ,
Or if her fate had left no trace behind .
But what meant this legend , pray :
And boiled down all his blood to brine .
Of scripture hold supreme authority .
For he is grasped of god .
Did you learn what it meant to be brave ?
Sobs gathering in her throat , her body weak ,
Giving thee thanks for death-accepted years .
The moon came on , came leaning low
The flames of love and hate may burn . "
So makes a god of vengeance and of blood ;
What purer joy could heaven bestow ,
A yawning cavern casts a dreadful shade :
Her tears should drop on them perpetually .
When now the flame had come unto that point ,
For outrage : mother of luxury , stripped stark :
The erring blade found bloodless sheath .
Flag-leaves that let green water through ,
Here left a blush upon the ocean wave .
Art thou a funeral vase inviting tears of grief ?
But memory failed : the chords and discords climbed
Then returned submissive answer :
His livid pallor makes me dread each moment
Thy great affection will be shown ,
So love grew out of that moment 's pain ,
Good tidings to bring ;
' e'er august be turned to september ,
Within thy breast make ruth or pity rise ,
From what far world hast thou been led astray ?
Right the wronged , and raise the weak .
Mourns less for what age takes away ,
Where he came in he put to shameful flight
Though all those waves went over us , and drove
Melted with pity , while he uttered this :
To foes that charge and coward friends that fly ,
With its roses the brightest that earth ever gave ,
But follow we angelica , who flies .
Could not remove the crushing weight that sat ,
And wild waves sent him mountainous . his ships
Little by little , there came forth another .
Proud of the power that to high birth belongs ;
A deathly sweat came o'er his brow ,
It hurries along till the rocks it wears .
The sun that sees our falling day ,
That goes the way that it lays ;
He breaks from his young bride 's encircling arms ;
Among the tents that line the way ,
That in his soul with fret and fever burn ,
Of angry fire is seen to fall .
Sleep had not fallen yet . the cyprian queen
And with love shall enfold
For you the hymn rose thrilling through the chancel
Still greater wonders are reserved for you .
Do forge a life-long trouble for ourselves ,
And with soft words such faint reproaches take
O'er thee let years so gently fall ,
Rising midst the swinging ocean .
Our waves the ripples that we make
" love for the virtue which attended me
As royal bharat thus gave vent
To give me courage , as from phase to phase
A wind of dreams comes singing over sea
And in my heart a hidden voice is calling .
Should turn to scorn and anger all his grief .
The centuries pass : the cycles roll along -
For nature gives to you her kiss ;
Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth ,
The flowers might never reach ,
As though death 's veil already had been cast
And cool winds whispered of the autumn near .
Thy grace the rite from check can free .
Then came the dear confession , full at last .
To pinnacle this day 's accomplishment ,
The glorious chief his speech renewed
Delirium flapping its thigh-bones ;
One dancer left the circling galaxy ,
Since their pockets had got such a delicate lining .
That render hope and hopelessness akin .
In the hollow where drifted dreams lie deep
From his sister 's heart swept the wildest moan :
Loudly roared in wild confusion :
And , when fatigued , i sought retirement ,
Pink and white drifting of petals sweet ,
The oath of battle , burning for the fray .
The fish his breathless body drags along .
They have found the waters of peace ,
From a twig 's having lashed across it open .
Onward beneath the sun following its course ,
The battle trembled to begin ;
The earth lies grace , by quiet airs caressed ,
From the pillar struck three colors ,
Is shown with master tongue ; their light is drawn
Of plenty , had poured the years full
Looks when first she made her entrance ?
And uther cast upon her eyes of love :
Till wisdom 's waters inundate the world .
And a haze about her tinged in fainter wise ;
Of fiery eyeballs swimming ; their drenched hair
Nature must give way to art .
The voice that spoke was the voice of fate ,
Still i see your sorrow , mother ,
Those lucent eyelids , veined with blue ,
For her my prayers ascend ;
Blessed the angel , gazing on all good ,
Followed with them , that sombre day .
Stone walls do not a prison make , 24 .
Soul unto soul , the cold lymph came between
No hunger compel to complain
By the anvil his livelihood got ;
And this proclamation made :
He , still more aged , feels the shocks
One perfect mind , which judgment calls its own ;
Where the people spent their money .
From great disdain of others it is born ,
Marks she set upon the mountains ,
Your ain will scarcely stand inspection . '
The mighty baptist that way marks the line
And set a feast before her , sumptuous
From touch of hand all friends might take , )
Cash -- that no charm can bind .
For the uttermost years have cried and clung
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;
The autumn is coming quickly ,
The winter sat lang ,
Thou shalt meet a cordial welcome .
Making the star seem silver streak 'd with gold .
To those who stand on death 's appalling brink !
When peace and wealth their land has blessed ,
May find as dear a nurse at need ,
While dad was gravely making each remark ,
Feeling the vengeance that her warrior felt ,
For we are love , and god himself is made
Where is now the hope , that brightened
And in a coffer it will store .
I took her dainty eyes as well .
And thus the sorrows of his soul explores .
Heaven heard his prayer , the burden fell ,
So passed his spirit into hades ' halls .
And as an hound that goth to folde
To bear in anguish , and lose in pain ,
A woman 's honour lies . "
And frae my chamber went wi ' speed ;
From the world 's life the years are fallen away
Her breath came quick , her blood swirled round ;
What was it made your dull blood thrill ?
Is this that makes of what i never meant
My doom i find is fixed above ;
" god and my faith shall hallow it .
Or ray of hope to lighten her distress .
" great patience wins ; it still remains ,
And the sunsets shall give sadness all its due ,
Across the ocean to spend the day ;
Gross darkness falls , and evil was our birth
Its treasures garnered from the fragrant fields ;
A foul night makes , it sagged ; for stars
When conscience tries our courage with a test ,
The author made almost no attempt to arrange the material
Filled with a faith no preacher ever taught .
Follow the track of the crimson day .
Such bliss as will last till we reach heaven ?
The shadows tremble in adoring awe ;
How swift the moments fly !
Watch nor vigil that night they kept .
And now the evening sun hath set upon it ,
We -- may god so give us grace ! --
But dark the perils that surround the sword ,
Pushed on the door which yielded , opened it
And make the world a better place , where only
My starved heart bore her vital in some way .
And not to share in such delights with thee ;
And slaughter mid the bráhmans dealt .
And leaden clouds flew o'er the dreary sky ;
Heavily groaned the helm of birch-wood ,
Now it bursts in swells capricious ,
Can bear the bacchanalian roar ;
But never a stain attached to him
His heart began in his throat to rise .
Sorrow which i bear , but can not utter !
The following errors remain as printed :
The singing waters run ;
When shall its hour of renovation come ?
A passage o’er his waves allow .
Then in that other 's eye some glance revealed
For us , to hope and bear on .
And it dropped into her stomach .
And the long line comes gleaming on .
That we can only reach thee with the mind ,
“ you see the night emerge to glorious day ,
By all this living beauty wrought !
See ! the soft wreath upward curling ,
To share the breathings of mortality ?
For i have seen its symptoms very plainly .
T'ave lost the good ye might have had .
Vanquished death is led in chains --
The third propitious dawn discovers crete . '
But ah ! the plain folk never rise .
Less full of purple colour and hid spice ,
The black sky stretches to the pallid sea ,
He gave consent she should endure in peace
Flowers fill them , grown in lovelier lands ,
On the southern sky hangs heavily far and sad .
It fizzled out but left to-day
Above the storm our prayers we lift ,
This gleam of sunshine from the days unruth
With circling footsteps reverent ,
With ardour follow where their leader flies :
It feels the kindling ray of spring ,
His breath came quick -- he thought aloud ,
Impels the sail , directs the oar ,
Beneath the flowers and fruit they show .
And marked the grim hun lead his horde .
But when the days grow long with bitter sorrow ,
To tell to his people peace ,
With blushing wreaths , investing every spray ,
Till the giddy bees went rolling home
While day arises , that sweet hour of prime .
No more in sorrows languish life away :
The murray jury sat and fed their joy
Hours the sun has spared to smite ,
On which all figures fix ' t their eyes :
Filled all the palace with her sobs and cries ,
That seeks to steal a lover true !
This choice , and many meet with no control ,
Grasses blowing from the meadow ,
The draught , it always sent in shutting ,
To manage witches , this is just the way .
Doors swinging into hallways filled with light ,
He raised his eyes the sky to view ,
The goods committed into fortune 's hands ,
Where every actor treads a bloody soil --
Twelve fiery tongues flashed straight and red ,
Not yet the daughter at her birth struck fear
To say that he alone has found the truth ?
And then a massie cross upon it laid .
The long night dies : the welcome gray
Of the flames that swirl and leap
The visions of the earth were gone and fled --
With the calenian knife their grapevines trim ,
Nor let thy heart be thus cast down ,
And think they made a great mistake ,
Which the long evening shadow is stretching before ,
Divide and multiply and add ,
Nor prize the day that gave them birth .
Which makes rich men to slack us ;
Spirit , substantial form , with matter join 'd
The might resistless of neoptolemus ,
And it won fame . the stately swan
Some other causes come , i know not what ;
Or break our hearts with thine hell-shattering hammer
And death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame .
Could i recall every joy that befell me
Of justice doth run counter to the edge .
The storm had come upon me all unseen :
" he who had marked her sorrow and lament ,
All accounts must come to clear :
And the alders bring discomfort ,
A wicked whisper came , and made
Into my bosom and be lost in me .
Thus the orphan child directed :
I see the lord i love . "
But peace destroyed what war could never blight ,
All my heart with joy is stirred ,
She heaved a sigh , and wiped her eye ,
The battle-balance hung . as when young men
And in the moans and groans my heart oft found
To open their childlike , asking eyes
Amend what flaws may lurk ,
Inventive genius never ceased to rise :
Of brighter sunshine makes the colours leap and range ,
If we may venture to believe in thee ,
There lay a special silence on the fields ;
Now the night arose in silence ,
For all earth 's old romance returned again ,
Till the anchor rumbled down on stranger shores .
A sudden breeze came singing from the sea
She can dress her eyes in love ,
The fairy clocks strike their inaudible hour
" enough for vengeance still remains .
Where the race of men go by --
These , only these , support the crowded stage ,
And bless the pangs that made thee see
And for a cycle of repose would go
Go on , obliging creatures , make me see
With a wife and children that caress him .
Only the dullest memories have clung ,
In crowded tumults heard and hurled .
Stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief .
Tear follow 'd tear , and groan succeeded groan .
And as this shamefull matter wanted grace ,
Inchanting daughter , thus the silence broke .
And go on wholly trusting to the end .
Nature soon will stupefy --
So radiant is love , it lends a glow
Their sweltish wearinesse to slake .
So still it lay that every day
A tiny ballet swiftly throws
" thy counsel shows thy wisdom and thy love ,
For a rumor had flown
And hither too , to dream and drain ,
She leaned above my wrecked and wasted youth ;
Much strife there hath arose in their prophetic skill .
The sun that gilds the creeping moss
All green and fair the summer lies ,
Love was not felt till noble heart beat high ,
The clergy keep me for their ease ,
Smiling they live , and call life pleasure ;
So the argument ran ; but one bright spring day
With horrid strides , hell trembled as he strode .
And , whether i came in love or hate ,
And at the last he took conclusion ,
To gaze upon his grandeur ; and the moon
And gathering still , where'er it wound .
The seas run high and the boats split asunder ....
When the wheel of time goes round ;
Pierced by some dexterous peasant , bleeds himself ;
But not a soft whisper replies to their prayer .
As after thirst , which made thir flowing shrink
The vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang ,
Of sky that marks the dark dividing seas .
Is lifted to rapture or sunk in despair . "
Lays worship that to heaven alone belongs ;
Aeneas heard him , and his vows addressed :
Which marks the christian 's second birth ,
For my heart is fixed for ever ,
And the mariner never makes a tack .
And shine eternal in the sphere of fame .
He found his firm glory on wise legislation .
Her swelling voice resounds the lofty strain :
Behold thy glory trembling to its fall !
Green the lost ribbons of reed-beds ,
Towers and battlements it sees
While on the deck the chief in silence lies ,
Shee drew along ; tumultuous madness , all
Hoots for the tinker tore the air ,
They work this transformation on the soul ;
And silently gained his rude launch on the shore ,
And the thriving , stirring city ,
When they together short discourse had held ,
Old denmark could descry .
Whence from those steep 'd within loud shrieks arose .
To take the upper servant 's fees ,
Hell became heaven as i passed . --
' the rude she softens , warms the cold ,
Sly beelzebub took all occasions
And every bosom feels how sweet the joy
Which held the wit orlando erst possessed ,
Mark how the labyrinthian turns they take ,
As plain as english bow can scrape it .
But where it could see her every day .
Since king eurystheus sat in majesty
Whence help comes with lioned leap . '
An hour had passed : the noonday sun
Before some light is lent it from on high ;
And outside all is ivy , clinging
Whereon is sinful fantasy to work ?
Should see salvation : we do pray for mercy ;
Where high in air a stately palace rose .
It matters not how merrily now rolls the drum ,
Was none but joy in his look would take ,
Faith can reveal to the spirit 's pure sight .
This adam and eve more advantages carried ,
And suddenly , as storm in summer , flew
To make a seizure on the light ,
The dawn it is breaking ; but lonesome and eerie
But here the tear of sympathy shall flow ,
He lifted up his voice in humble prayer ,
Which bleeds already , wounded to the heart
Its branches lean so very near
Reflect what truth was in my passion shown , }
All that spectral crowd rolled on .
That did not come to-night .
That told us the end was near .
Sweet shadows fell , and in their screen ,
And then the hive was made to rest
Of old days , come faint and hollow .
Which charmed my fancy 's wakening hour .
After many days it shall return with usury .
With power divine its story tell . "
There 'll come trying moments when
Backward now his memory glides
Freedom to love the law that moses brought ,
From the forest seems to float
And fate will use a running noose
Her throne once more the daisy takes ,
A devil rises in my heart ,
The moon bends o'er the waters lying still .
The increate perpetual thirst , that draws
Stung a stark horror ; and i felt my heart
That they have let the seasons wane ,
About its mother 's heart , and brought
't was the hare who took the tidings ,
A chord 's three parts distinct are found .
Teeth that flash and eyes that glare ,
Shall blush to own her barbarous laws ,
Ere the nun 's fears the knightly words dispel ,
And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade ,
Flashing leaped into the sunshine ,
But the worn-out emotions could not stab .
Then the dark ripples spread to waving hair ,
To hear the music of the grove resound .
And one i fell to loving there .
And all that mighty heart is lying still !
And makes us rather bear the graves we have
The gallant chidings rise ,
And , mid the shouts his followers raised ,
Nature 's own statesman , by experience taught ,
The same ambition can destroy or save ,
Thus , whilst aurora mounts her purple throne ,
And clammy walls repulsed the friendly touch .
That brought into this world a world of woe ,
This thought , once nestled in his head ,
But now the cross our worthies bore
The moon sinks low .
Ye dreary wilds , prepare his yawning tomb .
She shines on thieves on the garden wall ,
Their bodies , one after one , he bore ,
Love came back at fall o ' dew ,
Here giving thanks and oblations ,
It makes him grieve and more afeard
The noble heart within him smarted .
Lone wandering , but not lost .
Celestial regions , soak 'd with floods each sail :
Low looms her singing face to point the way ,
And yet thou art trailing in sorrow and sadness
You 'd better look out for that treacherous brute
Vengeance cries , ` your graves shall stay ! '
In safety lead them , where the other crag
The fragrance given of sleeping flower --
Of light by far the greater part he took ,
The hissing blow-fly seeks his love ,
Fill , fill the trump of fame
The graveyard gate clanged tight .
In it they likely see neea harm .
Her eyes shone with gladness
The sacred spring , prepared to tune
To where the orbs that govern burn ,
The waves beside them danced , but they
And i know that his heart is breaking ,
And not felt your gaze become more bright ,
Hearts that beat with love so true !
Which gave their noses a regal shine .
Wholly absorbing , lives to take my love .
Hast thou not proved and found the will of zeus
May the angels , shrouding your sorrow ,
So here they fall to strife ;
I hold no dream of fortune vast ,
The night he reached that was a sultry one --
That bound his breast in penance pain ,
There stayed the champions both with rueful eyes ,
The opening rose its beauties tine ,
At once put my heart out of pain ;
But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
Or the steep walls obstructed , round them cast
That seems to say i might , if i
While o'er the embers leaps the fitful blaze ;
And memories of youthful love i trace .
For all that they have tracked disastrous seas ,
Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring --
Has touched the kaiser 's soul ;
The way that the trap was set :
Only the bond of love which nature makes ;
To whom alone is given the right to see
Ever it thrust her on , and drew her feet
Majestically does stand ;
Which come and go whilst nature stands the same ,
It 's swift and sturdy and it strives
And thus the furious fiend addressed :
Along such lovely banks did run
And follow where the fluttered wings have gone ,
And fever germs on vitals preyed ;
When caesar , following those who bore the head ,
In the dusty chute that hugged the wall ;
Kindling them all as they pass by her brightness ,
And they unto their fortunes change to tosse .
She faded ' midst italian flowers ,
And jovial life was pass 'd and gone :
Who made confusion of the balkan tongues .
A flush passed over his face forlorn
The cest of amplest power is given :
How far a figure ought to go ,
So that the listening night has somehow learned
And swiftly passed the verdant bloom
All piety consists therein
My body shivered at the sight of him ,
' bring health and melody to every vale :
Where highways never ran --
But o short pleasure bought with lasting paine !
Give strength the evil to forsake ,
How this plan would have worked quite well ,
They made you feel sure it would always be best
Angry grew and cried for vengeance ;
Where the ports open , or the shores descend ,
I scarce get as far as the eaves ;
That recognize the night , give dreams their weight --
Pure , the fusion must come ;
Whom physic , i find , always makes melancholy ,
That fell a thousand centuries ago . ]
The wind is hushed , the star shoots by .
By the earth that drank their gore ,
A giant laurel spread its breathless boughs ,
He got understanding a month later .
This comfort came to me from the second fire ;
Who caught thee , though lightning fleet . ”
A prayer for one to guide and save ,
" the thoughtless world to majesty may bow ,
And clattering and battering and shattering ;
We shall rise a better nation
This life i lead apart from you .
That his place is prepared in hell ,
His twelfth diurnal race begins to run .
So beautiful , came foul and-twenty elders ,
And mend the blunders pride or folly makes ?
Pass away the great traditions ,
This martyr who found freedom for a race ;
It ought to change our humor .
If soothing it contain 'd or threat , }
And struck me , that it went
When spurred by tale of dire lone agony .
Her purity and truth will live for aye .
The gay enchantment was undone ,
Sweet hue of eastern sapphire , that was spread
Of early desire , nor see when it goes
A soul passed through the rift of blue
These blushing took a rosy hue ;
Nature , reserving them as seeds for things ,
And every time the music rose , -- before
My father 's house be still allowed to stand .
So i went onward timorous and thoughtful .
Fit subjects for important lessons found ;
Till wearied passion paused in its career :
To weave a garland for the rose .
I feel at times a love and joy
And wherever they lead us the fiend will pursue .
Their arms regained ,
Death and slumber bring thee gain
The shrieking goblins eachwhere howling flew ,
Or the flower in trying to reach it
That cools the bosom of the blushing rose .
By sufferings plunged too low ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
The humid sweat from every pore descends ;
Through sacred sweetness bred :
Which fell in solemn cadence on the ear
Is ill at ease , and calls for thee .
I wear it , set with stars of light ,
The lustre comes of heavenly birth .
Yet nothing back but fear and flight they bring ,
Has stamped the first grief upon memory 's page .
When young men feel they need a wife ;
What blight is eating thine old age !
The stars which rose when i began to guide
And , further inland , voices echoed , " come
Now i give thee rightful answer :
Over the kingdom the telegrams flew
On waves of fire came racing his needs
To rival thee he holds the western way ,
First heaven must needs so long revolve me round
Sorrow hath sometimes owed a gentler gush ,
Where time for time doth restitution make . "
Where the fishes leaped the surface .
With flowers that helen 's feet have kissed ,
The daisy follows soft the sun ,
When night 's low sighing stirs the sleepy solitude .
Long since its strength was given
And hollow voices murmur in his ears .
The kingcup swings his golden bell ,
Good master , give command
Many thoughts of trouble come ,
Together now the silence keeping ;
Already showed how light of foot we were ,
Reach my heart , as of old ;
The glooming clouds where groaned the gathering storm .
While venus fills the heart ( without heart really
And my wisdom-songs find welcome . "
To live where light is found .
And the trumpet that sings of fame :
With injuries , and death and shame pursued .
As your health or comes or goes ;
Shall feel the wintry air ,
To natures nobler than the ones we bring ,
The shadows hurrying grimly on thy flight --
Whose loveliness lives on , and does not fade .
Then raised the christians all their long loud shout
Surely a shamed head may bow down at length ,
Nor solace in defeat , save from that sense
The coming fate which threatens thee ?
It doth not flame and wane
To seek their fortunes on the world were cast :
My spirit closed with ida 's at the lips ;
When the thread has left your finger ,
And they made it their practice to dust 'em
A foolish strife ; they see
Father ! fill our souls with love ,
All true breasts shrink away !
Of anxious longing full , my eyes would seek
Alas the plans that came to nought !
Creation 's blended stores arranging as she flies .
Oh , catch the anthem that from heaven
And wilt thou other sins commit ,
Drive the shadows from the field ,
For void is contract made in fear ; alone
The king held talk with his chief in war .
So laughing grim , pass 'd the destroyer on ;
To mine the truths you can not batter ;
And terrible sounds , which swooped on her and hushed
The cynic school asserted
From lovely flowers that never fade ;
Cool gardened homes slept in the sun ;
The stones beyond the use of nature grew ;
When pitying heaven to roses turned
Beauties that the earth hath lost ;
Like the water ran the silver ,
The live wood came at guthrum ,
She sought by ways where death had gone
But peace went with her as she left
There 's many a bird makes no such haste ,
Turn much more keenly to religion .
The which she fills with visions , and doth dress
Scarce passed from boyhood . golden curls were his ,
While big the tears of anguish pour ,
Of vánar lords , these words addressed :
And almost a year to creep back into strength ,
And the infinite hand will guide us where
At last he set her both his eyes . --
Break the string ; fold music 's wing :
For sunshine makes the garden wise ,
The breaker raced o'er foaming shoals :
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame ,
But shall rise incorruptible ,
Will come too full of sleep for wandering ,
Shall tear the eagle from a conqueror 's grasp ,
Or ere this earth was made for loss ?
To think such beauty means a trap .
And bore her , struggling , blushing ,
Sam had spirits naught could check ,
And sailed my spirit surging , light and clear
Love that can wound love for its higher need ;
Fills it with yearnings that flow without ending ,
From all he said conviction sprung ,
The breath of morn is stealing o'er my brow
" time stands before the door of death ,
Forth into the village went he ,
Whose father just deceased left him a fortune .
Seeing there rode up between me and the sun
Vague pageants woven on a web of dream !
Wild leaves that winds have taken ,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide ,
Up from the valleys came song ,
The toil of war i will not shun .
And ease the captives aching heart :
They made a place to weep .
From childhood 's land they take their way ,
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell ,
This for the civil founded martial law ,
Had shut within him the rare seed
Stretched wide his arms for me ;
Sometimes it stops our vices as they rise ,
Mild o'er its valleys streamed a silvery day ,
Laid down in peace , after their pilgrimage ,
The sweetest dews of night are shed ,
Which a man who was really a carpenter made .
Though our faces they be often streaked with woe ;
In his mouth there lurks destruction .
Hast rendered me security , and drawn me
You must retain its word of benevolence ;
Filling all nature where its pathway lies
Fierce lightnings blazing in his face .
He look 'd to spend in meditative rest :
With cheeks that drown in artificial tears
The king who gives his people laws
Where many rock barriers did span it
And summer came with lips aflame ,
How yet the regal aspect he retains !
Thy fortune follow 'd , and thy safety wrought .
Lastly came winter cloathed all in frize ,
The biting axe of florence . farther on ,
Nor longer my breast knew the calm of repose .
And hope shall lead thee to the truth !
Ticked off upon a clock which never stays ,
When the nations lay prone in thy porches ,
That madest me follow glory 's theme ;
Of newton moved to music when he wrote
A carriage only fit for midwives ,
Tulips are tripping down the path
His anger , disdain , and despair wanted scope ,
But rather to take truce !
Or made the stallions stretch their picket bounds .
The startling answer came .
When grey showers gather and gusts are cool ? --
Had stood the test of mortal enmities
The light that shone when hope was born . "
We leave behind pale traces of achievement :
A band of blooming virgins led the dance .
And o'er our freedom guard shall stand .
Of threatened worlds and trembling firmaments .
Still perfect ; yearly is the pageant ranged .
Would make fit sacrifice ! so fortune deemed ;
What a wanton courtship meant ;
With the flame that in his bright eye plays --
Was pleasure 's gilded sceptre seen ,
It watched the centuries come and go --
Down from that strength had spurred their horse ,
Calling to mind antilochus by the son
For the huge anguish , which doeth multiply
The black , wild whooping , points the prey :
The forms of prayer she solemnly pursues ,
Thy rosy lips still wear a smile
No idols in his temple pure to set .
_ where the sea waves leap green . _
That look of hers can save thee from despair .
Like a disloyal phantom , followed her .
And the old courage gone ,
Low laughs the wind as if it grinned :
` to mark the mood of animals or men .
In church he may not go to sleep ,
Whene'er we take a tour abroad
Then nearer drew , and lingering , she gazed
Nor brown such truth expresses --
As proof that their faith had not grown dim ,
The palace rises , new and passing grand .
Death took my life away ;
Small gain i found to let her come ,
What views now meet their truly raptured sight --
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes :
Calling on them to rejoice ,
Of stories that gloomily bore
Amid a cloud of infantry he found ;
When he felt the stitches go ;
That cruel curse i can change and soften ,
We are but flowers that blush and blow ,
The speed with which our moments fly ;
In which ulysses sat , and fervent thus
As with faint light the heavens fill .
No least cloud hovered in her azure sky ;
Guilt gives them courage to maintain their fault .
And the chiefs made answer , saying :
No deluge , that can quench a heavenly fire .
Has made my days adventurous , my spirit strong .
The glory of her lilies lost .
Four years ! -- and didst thou stay above
That unbelief has not a space to breathe .
Like his have worse or better , enoch saw .
" no friendly visage comes to my relief ,
't is hard to settle order once again .
When all had made libation , and no wish
' ware the root that lies before you !
Thy life to thy neighbor 's creed has lent .
And in the spirit-land that lies
Forsaken seemed ; all empty lay the land
Of what their hearts could feel ,
Nor hath she ever chanced to know
And , hope abandoning , will helen yield
Which did preserve him ' midst such trials sore .
Our human height , scarce sever 'd from divine ,
Styled cleopatra , came along .
Sadly the winter comes !
The old dog snaps and grins nor ventures nigh .
And soon in safety reached the land ,
How happy a life does the parson possess ,
Their long cries enter the blue clouds ;
Her knitting-needles clicked and christine talked ,
It made you think of a schooner 's sail
There passed , as a shroud ,
Where over rocks and sands arise
Till now , as night fell and they lay abreast
And pour my spirit out in tears --
They cast a shadow and they call it death :
( no forces found that more might them dismay )
Set up in ostentation , made the gaze ,
In little season , which shall pass in worth
Which that tradesman scattered then ,
And following triumph which the other brought .
To lift the woman 's fallen divinity
And each had shown how light we far 'd along
O , the groans which now surge
And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage .
Till those tearful winds abate .
Take thou good care of the youthful heir ,
But that great-hearted man was led astray
Earth heard , and shook with joy sublime .
The sugar corn waved its soft leaves over all ;
Like a vine of lightning flashing from a wreath
Is there a heart that music can not melt ?
How charged with punishments the scroll ;
One presses on , and welcomes death :
That stalks with liberty along ,
And there came a smile on his face
They soon in the wonder an opening made .
A shelter from the storms that vex mankind ;
By night it joined the company of heaven ,
The baron jumped up in ecstatic glee .
See not the phantoms all my substance sees !
To which i turn a wistful face
And something sucked the flame in the tank .
To make her brood a winter house ;
The great hierarchal standard was to move ;
_ the tree says : _
For all the pangs that rage ;
The dust upon the folio settled ;
Once made my heart so sick :
Freedom from out of a wound shall rise .
Now piped the wind , or far aloof
And tendrils broke that held us two how dearly !
That can exalt all weakness into power , --
-- as ripening years incline upon their brows --
And i will place within them as a guide ,
Then turns his eyes towards the orient ,
With righteous care the sceptre swayed ;
Gentle was the answer hassan gave :
Dark clouds flit o'er the smiling blue ,
There very weeping suffers not to weep ;
O let me dying live till death doth come .
His foe no time his spirits to renew :
Hers is the passion that no man shall drain .
The sun had sunk behind vast tomerit .
But time which none can bind ,
The phantom armies marching go !
Now with bare frozen eyes which only greet
Upon life 's passing scene is shed .
The velvet down that spreads his cheek ;
With more beauty and passion than it can hold ,
His condescending smiles around him dealt --
To give expression to his painful joy ,
They felt by its beats her heart expand --
Passed through the guarded gates and went its way .
Warfare and memorable scathe may grow .
Do here find rest .
Wisdom by pain to gain . "
You have set me among those who are defeated .
Together these her scient hand combined ,
Nor starved my boyhood of its goodly feast ,
The grass than the flowers had grown somewhat higher ,
My whole heart rises up to bless
Each gave the other one 's nose a tweak ;
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
And yet with kingly pomp his numbers ran ,
Mourning for all that he had lost ,
Chase of glory wears the spirit ,
But thou hast got a bickering brother ,
Would you blame the world if it should press
And bring thy peace and silence here .
That to his present comforts led ,
Swift slips undine along the race
Where all dim shadows meet ;
Word was brought to the danish king
But glory remains when their lights fade away .
And feel that i am happier then i know .
And moving things went through the grass , and all
With joyous echoes fills the livelong day !
It roused the blood of yore ,
That island which tiberius held so dear ;
And moved to texas , which it tuck
To bring about our country 's overthrow !
Draw vengeance on the ruthless head ; --
A fetid sweetness fills the air of the room
Greetings bring to those that greet you ,
Girls do not go so far , that only women
He sees , and shuddering feels the vision true ,
At each some buried sorrow woke
A grievance he has always got ;
Fleeted and found me happy , till the dark
May oft distract us with their sad solemnity :
To sated ambition 's omnipotent sway :
“ for that would hurt your pride ,
From burgundy brought i the force i had ,
That gave her body to the tomb
Which soaking through the friar , tries to cool
Ah ye ! with toils and hardships worn ,
Fine fancies set me thrilling ,
The leaves will fade in the field ,
Whistled then as it passed !
And , tho ' you make the critics cross ,
And all that sours the wedded life .
Till broken by the ceaseless grief he fed ,
With inward pity eyed the scene ,
You kindle with his praise , your whole heart glows
Turning earth 's flowery haunts to hell .
Over the face of the leader came ;
All the cages that were set
The blissful day we twa did meet ;
Oh , say , where goes your love ?
To hold the added sweetness of a song .
He of the seraphim most absorbed in god ,
Where no joy dies till love hath gotten more .
Till they turn in great rejoicing . "
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay .
A voice from out the stifling smoke
The monarch ’s breast with glory swelled .
Have foes , who seek to wrong you .
That all the world took comfort far and near ,
Many years now has kept me here concealed
But now , though autumn gave but harvest slight ,
Who climbed my ladder of music to the skies
Cauld blew the bitter-biting north
And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers
And see it pass so far away ;
That tried to blossom in the snow ,
To catch heaven 's jasper-glitter .
To wiser heads attention lend ,
Which malagigi raised by magic sleight ,
Whereon the waves broke merrily
Then rattled our shot :
With chilling breath rude winds have blown ,
She harbors in her heart a furious hate ,
He comes and takes from darkness and cold their undivided
Be mocked or clean forgot as time wears on ;
But other flowers sprung up thereby ,
And curses germany , and asks revenge
That sweat the lusts of those in dust ,
Brings heaven to the flower .
Whilst the eternal lawrel hung ith ' air :
To ever stir thy peaceful breast .
And follow still where fortune leads the way ;
And each hid radiance there ,
To test the courage of my faith ,
To turnus ' friendly court directs his flight .
From the bitter wind gets grief ;
To come at length unto the wished scope
A wind blew out of a cloud , chilling
And his glory soon would fade
On his soul 's eyelid the pressure slid
Could tell a tragic history
Help us thy prophecies to keep !
It lit his face -- the weary face of one
Through him we gain the victory ,
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep :
It 's this that makes sublime my day ;
Are brought ; and feel by turns the bitter change
Holding the dawn ;
That turns earth 's smoothness rough ,
And gives the wounds we can not cure .
Can aught but good from perfect goodness come ?
Our simple life wants little , and true taste
But only the glorious organ 's sacred pealing
The sombre clouds through which the sick sun climbs
Superfluous matter came , shot out in ears
They could not surely give belief , that such
By wonders sacred nature stood controll 'd ;
That never summoned to the fight --
You 'll leave the world a better place ,
To win her grace , whom all commend .
Have plainly made it out that four are three ,
How strange that peace should thus be found
Bent to the tempest as it rush 'd along ,
And now his grief may be compared well
The life within me seems to swim and faint ;
Oft show the tenants needing safer sheds :
Where hunters fand the murder 'd bairn ;
Than the wealth thou hast discovered .
The day is done and every hour is spent
Though nation warred with nation . hatred fell
All stars of heaven except the guiding one !
The yellow blood of trade meanwhile should pour
With dark distrust and sad repentance filled ,
The song that lightens toil .
Incense slowly drifting through :
And fill 'd the heavens with its solemn sound .
The moon gives you light ,
Holds my breath quailing on the bitter bound ?
That keeps me aye happy as happy can be .
And a thrust pushes with such might and main ,
Why wear that veil of drifting mist ?
To guard the weak from wrong .
That i trace this evil pathway ,
For trust , dear boys , the time will come
There is a lonely minor chord that sings
Peace you shall never find ;
Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly . "
We find our aspirations quenched in tears ,
Yet i bear a heart shall support me still .
And the deadly missiles fly .
We gave our lives to set life free ,
Where daṇḍak ’s forest wilds extend .
It makes me think of pleasant things
In civil conflict met on bosworth field ,
Pat as a sum in division it goes --
As a warrior that stabbeth his foe
I 'll leave the light of loving eyes ,
The winds were welcome as they swept ,
Youngest green transfused in silver shining through :
Of aventine spread oft a lake of blood .
While that placid sleep came o'er thee
The little joyous lark , unconscious , sings , --
The thin hill pushes against the mist .
Shiver in the night wind that turns them white .
Vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts ,
Remembrance tells him , once 't was paid .
The sun upon them shot his summer ray ,
Would e'er these people scent the devil !
Will bring enough of sorrow . "
Music can soften pain to ease ,
Now were their anchors cast ,
Willingly thy life thou givest
The message of deliverance comes ,
The dewy chaplets hang on air ;
Made the tempests rage around them .
To put your trust in god alone ,
A better sex to bradamant is given .
On rays which moon and daystar give :
And sweetness fell around
We two bore witness to our sovereign 's power .
Tied by this law , such fates are willed ;
Cain had already shed a brother 's blood :
Like moonlight and sunlight combined .
Of those , who load them with committed sin .
The spell that first arrested now lured on ,
Whilst the moon 's beams upon its bosom played ;
As gave to beauties that might be
She snatched at heaven 's flame of old ,
So sirius , flashing forth sinister lights ,
Faded with morning , but his purpose held .
Let us take it as it comes !
How extremes meet ! the very darkest crimes
By gilead road a river runs ,
Than liberty , the queen whom justice serves .
' ye come of a right good race ,
The evening mists arise
Passing that way his benediction give .
Turned to their fun again .
Bestir my heart to put my song in sheen
For a present his grave-shroud they folded ;
Wi ' ought o ' feeling free ;
' midst all the sweet breezes that blow ,
But it carries a sparkle ! and now enough ,
The course he will take is clear :
Till the last , last flicker goes
And valor seem 'd to fire his breast
As the clouds are swept from heaven ,
Now fall the chill reactionary snows
Lest precious tears should drop from susan 's eye .
We hold our christian course through good or ill ,
Strange characters he found , and viewed them oft ,
The army life develops comradeship .
Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal 'd .
And found her full of flaws .
Should make me remember your rippling smile --
The heaven unexpected came ,
By text and title , it drew back resigned ,
No troy shall hold thee . "
Fled from her lifted arm that waved adieu .
And his lips were moved in prayer ,
Then at atrides ’ haughty feet were laid
The sudden gloom that o'er my spirit fell .
Down-stream all the rapids are troubled with pebbles
The morning came , the chaise was brought ,
Mellow and yellow and rounded hangs the moon .
Revelled and roared the christmas fires of logs ;
And all thy heart lies open unto me .
Miss roscoe maintained her air of pathetic sternness .
And all the beauty that the lost years gave !
Ye fields , where summer spreads profusion round ,
And fashion to what he it list apply .
Of the spicy gales that filled the sails
A level top it lifts above the deep ,
The attic window you must take .
And shuddering , back she sunk into her chain
And wisdom strives to gain ,
Whereof the rumour reached to saladin ;
And on the swelling ocean frown ;
Whatever drove or lured or guided him , --
Love came , and brought sorrow
On gentle gales the grateful twilight came .
Would bring displeasure to your face .
That bring the fog and mist .
No price is set upon them ,
Gabriel , and michael , and him who made
And his own sins made wonder for the throng .
Many weeks his tears were flowing ,
To carry into deed mine own desire .
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
The meaning grows in baby 's eyes ,
Across the waters sought a world unknown ,
The toil of it none may share ;
The big maple trees all throwing their shadows ,
For showery clouds o'er tepid nights that pass
The time will come when you 'll be sad
Against his mouth her subtle mouth she set
Corruption could not make their hearts her soil ;
Skies studded with cloud-crags sheen .
Echoes that mingled and fainted and fell with the fluttering
But oft revolve the vision in thy heart :
Whose ancestral fame had filled ,
The only art her guilt to cover ,
Then , stung with grief , and with resentment fired
Where the sea-flower spreads its leaves of blue
The happy place the print seems yet to bear ;
Ne'er find perfection in its full extent ,
Thy mists that roll and rise !
Behind him trails a fiery glare .
A solemn shadow falls in pillared form ,
That novelties please less than they impress .
His faithful friends unhappy dares bore :
Till the news of her hiding got vent .
The prison of his tyranny who reigns
Whisp ' ring the banks their discontent :
Those eyes , which such pure love revealed ,
Her words in such alluring sort she framed ,
With all the costly offerings laid around
Think what death means to you , never to join
Where dead delights , and fair lost faces stray ,
You can tell the love of jesus ,
In files , and as they mount expire
Of conscious sin makes my heart afraid ;
Take heed of this small child of earth ;
For their poetic fame had spread
And it chuckled at my illness ,
Wheeler 's excellent summary again says : --
Where the glad news had not gone .
They had everything that his money could bring ;
For thus i put it : either judas was ,
True happiness resides in things unseen .
Should he be living , i 'll make known
We now will pass from sad to lively scenes ,
And rebel-starving made your loyal calling .
Her wisdom -- for what wisdom pleased like hers !
With a gleam of heaven to make them pure ,
The power to soar is gone !
The tender gladness it doth say
Before the crowd that round her pressed .
Where sonless maids their sorrows heal ,
And to us all that love extends ,
He , to get the warm side inside ,
Speak , and courage will find grace . "
Of glory , and hath added wound to wound ,
That held her race but yesterday
And in words like these expressed him :
So told as earthly notion can receive .
Was the growing bones of me .
Take part in our thanksgiving lay ,
No single soul the church brings forth
The drought came down on the field and flock ,
When wastes the soul with anguish ?
For six props the house supported ,
The land will know less trouble . ”
From thee with love 's rich wounds to burn !
The trojans keep aloof the rising war .
Lord of all worlds , to thee we raise ,
Whose constant fires of worship rose .
Each other to unhorse , unseemly act !
Shone through and made her wasted features bright
In joyous dance these country folk did pass ,
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light ?
Clung to the hand to which it passed
And makes a moral resolution ;
Slaughter , whether god strengthen us for , 400 .
And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade
Which a man who was really a carpenter made .
At our ears wild shadows whistle ;
The chief adopted by the martial maid !
The seeds of latent evil , which may spring --
Now to their king a message quick has flown ;
With pity moved ; radiant in arms he shook
Fine progress they make in our liberal opinions ,
By pride of wondrous gifts impelled ,
And spacious halls where lances lay ,
Was seized with a dreadful indigestion ;
In laughs hysteric were displayed ,
To the fir-trees tossed thou trouble ,
But could not sit for pain .
Shall force the flying mede with coward hand
Of blue on blue there should emerge
I , till the destined years be spent ,
That all of mortal mystery reveals ;
Or if our hearts shall break with bliss ,
Came a deadly fear upon them !
A towering structure to the palace join 'd ;
Here they foot it , pacing slow ,
Waiting for her soul to quicken
Who many a weary year has spent
Their wounded hearts and names we find
Of earthly happiness gives place
And terror crept behind .
Till they were turned unto thine overthrow :
All is lost ! to the half-burned hall
A dreadfull countenance she given hath ,
Our plighted friendship will extend .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Was spent upon a fevered fen in greece ;
That the stars i may consider . "
Their voices told they gave me welcome warm ,
And even to god may violence extend
In the faith that looks through death ,
On strictest rule his stern life spent .
As the seasons come and go .
The final toll the gods may take .
Too long followed they leave life as a dream ,
I stood by honor and the dean ,
Holds nothing secret ; and eternity ,
Where england holds the elect of all her dead
Three rosebuds springing in a single flower ,
Answered in the words which follow :
The western tide crept up along the sand ,
Has power to keep or save . that civil war
I should not feel the pain of dying ,
Whence there sprang up an armed man .
He gained a world ; he gave that world
And the eyes bedimmed with bitter tears
Shows where toil sups and these things lie ,
Feels new life with an ecstasy .
That rose and conquered all the world .
By which then prospects were much brighter made .
How comes it ye return to me
The missing link of love has left a void .
He climbed through darkness to the twilight air ,
But dust that the serpents eat . '
And all to form a garland for my love .
Not vain the vision which the prophets saw ,
Loud rang our laughter , and the shout
The red light from his mantle passes
That gave thee this so high inheritance .
Fires my brain , and wings my feet ,
If i may gain such favour , as to gaze
Whom nature hath made apt for every change !
The cycles round themselves and grow complete ,
Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish 'd me ;
Silence of moorlands rolling to the skies ,
Again what arrogance we see !
Voice after voice caught up the song ,
The crested lord of battles came ;
Still as we gazed assumed a lovelier glow ,
Where geography finds no one to oblige her
Nor summer blossoms mixt their sigh ,
You have kept the freedom nature gave .
With joy pelides saw the honour paid ,
Dying , to feel the same again ;
The glorious company addressed :
There underneath , not made by torments sad ,
And blood had flowed at lexington ,
Kindling strong men . swift closed the fronts of fight
And he who pass 'd his time in tears .
Thence flashed it , as the crimson currents ran
With kisses , such as virgins never give
A new world was opening up to nell .
The president rolled in splendor new
She was more fair than words can say ;
Between the banks which bear the vine ,
And finds the heart of his antagonist .
The choice whereof with that good warrior lay ,
That tend to make your organism shiver ;
That picks up crumbs around the door . ’
Nor other tidings of the youth had read ,
Her low tones grow caressing --
Made known by thee -- i see no fixity
Then crushed with weariness and hardship crept
Not yet the daughter at her birth struck fear
They stay their crystal fretting ,
My doctor gives me — all the news .
O keep your heart , my good young man ,
That pity which for terror thou hast taken .
The future fills me with dismay ;
Forth from his ample chest there came
That seemed a sorceress who wove
Not , not till then his active soul shall claim
Flushed through her memory , and a swift thought came
Ev'ry shock that malice offers ,
Where the daylight dies in fragrance ,
And , finding for conversion too unripe
With these let _ harmony of parts _ combine .
Where greater spirits come .
Than to staunch a stream of sorrow
Then in the war of roses came the crash
A people can put forth in freedom 's hour ;
A lonely way to follow ;
Beautiful the forest stood ,
Where love has dropt his burning spark !
The figure which the spirit lost , its skin
Parted indeed by more than makes the sea .
Ere beatrice descended to the world ,
To quench the promises that would arise : --
Grotesquely wonders come to pass .
A better job will come my way . "
Thus , to repose , all nature goes ;
How to the circle fitted , and therein
And he spoke the words which follow :
August is gone and now this is september ,
And pleasing slumbers steal upon his eyes .
A wind from heaven began to blow ;
When were made the ether-spaces ,
And she sought a place for breeding ,
A painted quiver at her back she bore ;
That with my son the throne will share ,
While breath frae heaven this breast can draw ,
Night and hell keep it in the underworld !
They lifted me from dreamland .
While moons and stars their courses run ,
A little wife he took ;
The soldier bears the grim and dreary role ;
Spake , and was heard by fell disease -
Far out afield they lie ,
The eternal snows appear already passed
From the warmth of the sun that has set ?
The dark hills hung framed in with gloomy gold .
Or fill with sudden tears the eyes that read .
Till the noontide lull is gone . "
And took a place in all men 's sight ;
His last breath was drawn .
And so he followed the sweet sound ,
The dame made a curtsey ,
As the dawn drew in on their faces there .
' to make a flaming speech in parliament .
They have not laughed , and therefore ill goes he
My love is summer passing through the land .
Her that gave thee life and beauty ,
Men 's sins destroyed are when they repent ,
Coerulean darted at the wearer 's throat ,
Two talents lay of gold , which he should take
The devil ca n't get out again .
For me there 's naught to dissipate my grief ;
Where peaceful morning loves to rise ,
It sings the blessed song of peace ! "
Gold falls first on the red-hot sand ,
Or that it sprung from opportunity ,
In centuries to come , with more of dread
Gather and break , but never can dismay
She felt his pleased eyes read her face .
And i keep my solace in constant reach : --
Lonely pipes are lifted softly in the valleys ...
It passed from mahomet to moses ;
White body made for love and pain !
So long as faith with freedom reigns
By violence first plunged and dived therein :
From the pierced pupil spouts the boiling blood ;
So i swallow my sneer and i study his dope
Comes mellow to you where you sit ,
For his soul 's quiet worked the awakening spell ;
Setting toward eternity ,
Her latest words scant well expressed were ,
An essential in every craft , calling and trade .
Her promise sacred , saw him fall asleep .
Gentle joy-winds to caress you .
The first good shot that robin led ,
Vulgar and pitiful -- my heart bowed down --
Refreshed , we 'd patiently pursue
Gives still to prophesy , while others flit
Such fragrance round my couch it makes ,
For with understanding always prejudices disappear .
And give the highway back its state .
That well they showed desire for their dead bodies ;
The sunny and rainy seasons came and went
And his flesh trembled as aghast he stood .
_ the way the setting sun had led ; _
And blood is flowing from his side .
These draw the chariot which latinus sends ,
It will not stir for doctors ,
In baldwin next he spied another thought ,
That finds a nest for him in every tree ?
Of passion find an utterance in thy lay ,
When death takes its young :
Tosses in billows when it feels thy hand ;
But his foes too with candor sees ;
The tears stood in her eyes
Shadow of clouds that swiftly pass ,
The maples , shedding their spinning seeds ,
And by thy force the happy stars are sped .
In the gay world to make pretence }
While day and night can bring delight ,
Where fever turns toward fever , knee toward knee ?
It crept tear-spattered into song ,
Where the great wall round china goes ,
The light that through the gothic windows shone .
" love for the virtue which attended me
Erroneous , which in blazing ruin fell
Such was the smoothness of it , and it shone
The low grass loaded with the dew ,
Each from the other 's fate some solace drew ,
Ye bells that wake the ascension morn ,
So ran her blood ; such was its hue ;
And , pleasing me , his life defend .
And who claims your attention and care .
Alas , alas , upturned it lay
She fixed him with a stony eye ,
And agonies came thereof .
All brought expressions of delight ,
To cross the silent centuries and be heard ,
The waves lie still and gleaming ,
To sit and consider the point in debate ,
Take on the tint of twilight .
France 's far-distant ocean seek to win .
Which every heavenly hue had dressed
The triumphs won and the needless pain ,
On poet times the month of poets shone --
And love of goodness keep him free from blame ,
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
To hear 'em sing would make him shout !
In her all loveliness is found complete .
An earthquake brought the wonder palace low ;
Entranced she stood -- the mocking visions came --
Some comfort to my sinking heart to bring ;
Which she assumes when seen by poets ' eyes ,
His mind is set on hunting mice ,
Until he found the path which led
Our wisdom speaks from failing blood ,
Fill the sad isle with horror and affright .
Each coldly lighted by his tiny faith ;
The white sails set to the breeze ,
To fill the hungering hearts of men ,
On which the gathered horror hung ;
And from the forlorn world his visage hide ,
Like rainbows that have taken wing ,
And make the hopeful hope in vain .
The sign , from prying eyes concealed ,
Listened , to catch his slightest meaning .
What radiant legions rise !
And youth itself comes back as once before ,
This royal house in death has laid .
Of aged nile reveal the springs unknown . "
Of art or beauty therefrom may be wrung .
Let all my priestly guides be led . ”
A frieze extends below those galleries fair .
Next day , the deadlock broke .
When the lash of her tongue made him grieve ;
Whom still embrace with ardent love .
Until her own heart 's love returned again ?
Should never gain from him an equal love ;
All germany is torn asunder ;
For thee the lark distils his morning mirth ,
That lends its softened name to art , --
Wept and trailed her tresses gray
Yet when this fiery web is spun ,
If duty done makes all the others brighter .
To boast their talents and get places :
On the path that once led home .
That love could bind them closer well had made
That o'er , the gael around him threw
The baby , and the breast its fingers grasp --
Had sown the name at which we sneered ,
Ere peal of closing battle rose ,
That nature there herself had made
With bands that strove to pierce and strike
His heart was true , and fortune smiled . "
His early vows were paid ,
And if they ever chanced to grieve ,
Like the eyes of wolves glared at them !
Who fight to conquer love and rage ,
The youth , his rising sorrow to assuage ,
Softly here they shake their feathers ;
Eternally they meet with hostile shocks ;
And now the valleys are laid in snow ,
To give homage , style , and fashion ;
A vineyard , where the grapes hang blue ,
Whose powers restrain the deadly arms .
That they still were to run by her side
There was no joy left in the calendar ,
And turns to giddy flames that go
If love were silent , drawn apart ,
See the whole vision be made manifest .
Loud and chill blew the westlin wind ,
Our eyes were drawn together , and the hue
That shed religion on the soul ; at once ,
When the wide bloom , on earth that lies ,
To force the gate ; the scyrian infantry
Seems summer 's life -- a blossom cast away .
And his first thought of life that lives
And haughty thrones are to their own destruction hurled .
Knacks ! the chair breaks ! down they go --
" an orange hue the grove assumes ,
Joy , that transcends all sweetness of delight .
Pressing hands and whispering passion ,
Up to the father 's listening ears arise .
When comes your moment of decay . _
Fed from his flame they own his golden rays ,
Thy robe that flows discordantly !
How fresh aurora violets strewed and roses ,
" sleep 's magic forces close my weary eyes ;
That never a comfort can they find
Her charm has loosed the chain it bound ,
Our tears are shed , our sighs are given ;
Life , as a witty bard has shewn ,
I myself put forth my magic ,
And clashed the might of brazen mailed men .
Though here all slips from out her weak embrace .
For soon as comes the springtime face of day ,
And sends a comfortable heat from far ,
The plan the lords in council laid
What sweet spell are these elves weaving ,
What i now feel in writing this adieu ,
And still the laughter deepened as they rolled
The shadows lay along broadway , --
Than you could find in joy . "
Which made him daily bless his own neutrality .
The death that makes ethereal life would bind :
I love to feel thee clingin '
Unpunish 'd ; but he found them all alike
The ponderous engine raised to crush us all ,
Knelling for a soul that 's sped ;
As those which meet my eyes to-day .
And , by the loving life he led ,
There , darkness full of wonder met the eye .
As god was good to make for me .
And through the soft long wondering days goes on
To memory now returned his lady gay ,
The duke has got an heir , our prince
Of all the trees that spring in wood ,
Where the gray gulls flit with restless endeavor ,
Their gates wide open threw .
The death-like lightning came .
Where our fathers built hate
The stain of thy wing is washed away ,
From which there rose a great cathedral ,
A rumour of this purpose ran ,
And thanks to god who brings this bliss !
Ukko , gave the youth his broadsword ,
Your thoughts should chance to turn to me
The snow fell hissing in the brine ,
Has gone with the maiden . the blood of youth
Then the tzar made answer to the pasha :
Which takes therefrom vitality and power .
No bowed triumphant head hath borne ,
Nor fears a rival , to divide his gains .
Who saw the light and followed it ,
Or singly , touched with sunny glow ,
Of cruel juno , from the gods he bore ,
Scepter and power , thy giving , i assume ,
The hour is come , a time , unmeet
The feeble hath subdued her heart ;
In adamantine chains shall death be bound ,
My heart , departing , bade a last farewell .
Smiling they live , and call life pleasure ;
Few hearts on earth their vital memories keep .
We two will pass through death and ages lengthen
Could blew the bitter-biting north
The monsters rushed to put it out .
And a loathing over sir launfal came ;
Within her smile that lay :
That only serves to make us grieve
Then out of a cleft rose a terrible cry ,
Ave and ave ! and the music rolled
He gave consent : they sought the trees
We 'll cover love with roses ,
Whose royal height and splendour showed
For without hearts there is no home ; and felt
Though blindly struck , their recent vows of love
Of the good man glowed fervently with faith
Earthly cares have died from all my being .
Than that the bird sings where it builds beneath
Once more been tortured with renewed life .
The trench lights gleam and the rockets play .
A wind of frost that gives no rest
And with the last he still directs the just .
And know -- the wheel may rest !
Home of my boyhood , can chase thee away .
So that it wholly springeth from my wit :
At flower and fruit our flashing strokes are made ,
Whose red tongues made the shadows dance like devils .
Following from world to world intent i seek . "
And leave other nations to guess at our age .
The larger streams run still and deep ,
And the music that kept them whirling
He crushed remorse and wrestled down despair :
And fly to bring my soul relief ,
The wind among thy chambers went
' think it over as you stand .
Poor woman , lay aside the mournful letter
The daisy follows soft the sun ,
The wondrous ages pass like rushing waves ,
And left him sorrowing on the lonely coast ,
And the vain dream hath flown .
Convulsed and savage flames , they cling ,
Old joys reviv 'd once more i feel ,
Where down smooth rapids whirls the helmless dream
The footmen ceaseless charged . no hope was left ,
And subtile change makes mould of me ,
My roses are battered into pulp :
The base who by fraud or extortion would rise .
That journey toward arles , the tale pursue .
O'er the bright stones it goes , --
That flashed their baleful faces in the sky ,
What once it seizes as its prey !
Brought the measures as directed ,
And cool air gathered with a trembling fan ,
Afresh they family altars raise --
This heavenly comfort still i win from thee ,
Toil has shed round your head
Immovable , yet filled with dreamful longings ;
Whose naked waters arched the sanctuary ,
The moon that moment peeping through a cloud ,
The rescued lotus came to life .
A little while they spent in sad delay ,
But joy just then was up and whistled bye
To capture the leaping wealth of the tide , for
Which lies between romagna and the realm
' outside thy gates ; till thou hast given heed
Fond nature saw the blasted vine ,
Which brings me near and nearer to the gods ,
Embarked , and daring sought the further shore .
No favouring answer found ; that arms laid down
Life is a lovelier thing than lovers see ,
What kind of vengeance rests for thee in store ?
That have no halo , hold no golden clue ,
I mean not to pursue the cavalier .
Bearing the heat of the day .
Which patriots call to mind
Religions change , and come and go like flame .
Flattering prospects urge your stay ;
Every day brings its pleasure :
Whose stygian throats breathe darkness all day long ,
How our own minds are made ,
Like a shadow eastward thrown
As though he intended my labors to share .
Changed color as texas ' vast reaches i struck .
Only the soul that plays its rhythmic part
The best that ould oireland has seen ;
And , while the foliage interposing played ,
My heart will fondly trace
A mournful cry which shattered all their mirth ,
Their glories closing in perpetual gloom ,
The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze ;
When the grey , creeping dawn had now begun
With songs and spells that change the blood ;
From clare that goes to the sea ,
Their sons , they gave , their immortality .
I give you gratitude in this :
And she gave a rede of ill :
When the dusk comes down and the shadows play ,
To banish of the pangs which now he feels .
Nor india 's king the dreadful silence broke .
I know whose prayers would make me whole ,
Domestic woes far heavier to be borne !
Bringing to life thoughts dead in doubt and error ;
Of vengeance taken in so just a cause ;
Lo ! i raise them into honour over all !
That lets love in upon the golden air ,
I saw a beauty from the sea to rise ,
But forth the father ’s anguish broke ,
That made the breeze to blow !
To a world that has quickly grown cold !
Sage counsel pour 'd in understanding ears :
Kauppi gave this prompt decision :
Loves that are lost ere they come to birth ,
Softer and richer than velvet is seen .
And ere the noon wert lying low ,
" greatly his opera 's strains intend ,
The majesty of clouds that swarm .
Joyous the sprite of your poetry bringing .
With laughter dying down as the great knight
Where scarce a step the foot could take
" then the iron sought out a refuge ,
And the night shut and opened , and behold ,
France too returns , but keeps a tighter rein ,
The magic car moved on .
Is made familiar , watches his approach ,
Search where the hanging woods extend .
But right or left as strikes the player goes ;
Has made the blood from his right should flow .
There lies the shore that bids us hope success :
Whom i have set there in that lofty home :
And he spoke the words which follow :
And thus admitted english fair
Immortally , made all those mortal births :
Would bear a freeman 's mien .
Where the fiends of battle leaped ,
Some hope yet remains for me :
To him her hands she stretched in prayer .
Horrors that make the heart stand still .
God gave the soul . -- thy discontent with time
And all the splendid youth her error took
Feigned to make proof if for his arms he were
Broke but the bond of love which nature makes .
Through marching scores of winters racked she lay ,
By richer friends possessed .
Still hangs the hedge without a gust ,
But now my muse hath spied a dark descent
So when the year takes cold , we see
Where they waited to welcome the murmur it gave ?
_ " mary , many a day has passed ,
Along the drowsy noise so made ,
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
In a mystical rapture there comes to me ,
God controls the fate of nations ,
The passing farther onward took from it ;
Has made me most bloodily thirsty ;
That leads from this to the home up yonder .
Its bright feet lit the hill and wood
Fates lead the willing , but unwilling draw .
My love comes back to me !
How hard that chain will press at last .
Take the sufferings from the suffering ,
And of the joy their light was bringing .
When the stars threw down their spears ,
Should fell disease assail her now ,
To meanings all about us hid !
The same rapt wonder , only filled
The sun stood poised upon the western verge ;
The lonely sunsets flare forlorn ,
Then on the level plain its fury spends ;
And clear the depths where its eddies play ,
But lightlier falls the touch of loving hands .
Thus went on speaking
That insult follows injury .
Though but a lonely way , yet mystery hangs
On his celestial errands bound .
Thou happy child whom a good god hath given
Suddenly lifted his voice and cried :
Only in dreams thy love comes back ,
And , seen through friendship 's atmosphere ,
Her sun still burning with fresh glory bright ,
Is by hosts of others followed .
To my sage counsel therefore did i turn .
And the chiefs made answer , saying :
Decay crept in , unquickening the mass , --
Has found the ideal which the poet sings --
I 'd strive her " worth " to reach ;
Well their father 's substance had divided :
On the dresser let it stand
The head to strike , and skeletons stretch forth
To make an empire free .
Coarse stuffs and hot flesh weaving together .
When he 'd give a broader franchise ,
That the full torrent of his grief had gone ,
Blacker than shadows cast by palace walls
But nature here that shape can show .
Amid thine armed foes , to seek thy shame .
We came to wrestling grips ,
Reeling the blow sent me .
" i broke the spell that held me long "
To dream all night of what the day denied .
To follow ráma forced to tread
Out of his heart , or crossed his thought ,
A thing that creeps , it can not go ,
The feeble births acquired diseases chase ,
By bravery 's simple gravitation drawn !
Easy fall the heroes , victims
The moving beasts the dread allay ,
Piercing the secret purport of my speech ,
If changing empires rose or fell ,
A year has gone , as the tortoise goes ,
That fell so cold and fast ,
From their poor breasts went sueing to her ear
To yield thee to my pleasure .
Then follows cleopatra , lustful queen . "
That providence , which here distributeth
She only brought new tears to thee .
He is crushed with fear !
With the same love will make it sad ,
Henceforward have no pity . send the strength
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast ;
That registers the grudged unpitied sighs
That not a nose in france but stood awry ,
His scorn pierced like a deadly pain .
Under the shadows till the tumults died
They about the fire did go .
A pretty while these pretty creatures stand ,
Upon this side with virtue it descends ,
Which tells me , youth 's no longer here !
Abode his destined hour , and went his way .
And such as art like mine can give .
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
Silence of hopes long seeking , which
But sorrow mars with lingering trace
That bids the flames of war retire !
Thine , heaped too high for wrath to weigh ,
Have made a kind heart bleed ,
Through the three worlds in terror fled
Sorrow is life 's guiding star ;
The dew sat in gems ower thy ringlets ,
In any kind of mischief to be wrought ,
Alone gives token of thine ancient , dread
Might have cut short that nose an inch .
A shadow falling across the greyer night ,
My heart has flown , to sing
Then how blest when night is closing ,
Down from the mountains rush the frightened deer .
He watched as the good ship cut the sea ,
Then the heart , with gladness stirred ,
Their warfare learned of thee . "
Thou hast spent thy life for the holy grail ;
But now , i feel my pensive spirit turn ,
Took sound and form upon the ivory keys ;
What to their souls would sweetest comfort bring ?
And now the mountain breezes scarcely bring
The smiles of nature shed a potent charm ,
And all thy tender care displayed ;
Can force your way through learning 's thorny maze
Life 's rougher paths grew level where he trod .
No gift i bring but worship , and the love
Surges , and ebbing , leaves my lips morose ,
Outside the branches sway , and winter weather
Ah , could the world but gaze upon that christ
' the forehead charged with baleful thoughts and dreams ,
And thy complaints serve but to show thee more ,
Each wild lust that lingers there .
That calls unto his mate , uncomforted --
Within the plaza and held the batteries .
And in a sad and softer tone pursued ,
By nature warmed and led by thee ,
From a worthy race descended ;
Deep in the mould till winter has gone by .
To reach their ears , such was the deafening din
There lies the great ocean of song .
I heard what made my heart to dance ,
A maiden to the fountain went ;
" till twilight comes and ray by ray
Even as they gazed , a sudden tremor came ,
Which a man who was really a carpenter made .
Whose essence , spilled upon the breeze ,
There came no other sound .
He called for elemental strife .
Like rushing torrents from the bursting skies !
New vows they find . " may mighty winds arise
The burning river sends his earnest prayer :
Lest it his opposite should cleave or bore .
No gaudy-tinted butterfly that way did pass .
For which the human race keep such a coil !
The fraud designed , the purpose dark ;
To scan their verses , not their vices .
And a rending shout went skyward that outroared
No sickness can come near to blast my health ;
Throughout the world your growing fame has spread ,
Come , that the vision your eyes may greet ;
Your life in faith complete find its refining .
So , take and use thy work :
The orchards spangles hung .
Which when melancholy thoughts come o'er her ?
Far off , and instantly such laughter rose ,
To him made this sudden vision
Draw no cheerful music from it .
“ nor could such acts defence by words allow ;
His life lay in their cruel hands ,
He lifts his voice and cries his sermon ,
A long slant splendor downward flowed .
And my spirits gushed and bubbled like a fountain
Eye and ear it fills with wonder ,
That from which it sprung -- eternity .
The mate by long conspiracy designed ;
In the oak he maketh pictures
Wrapped forms that moved as melodies move ,
They sprung up freshly in another .
He formed no wish for good or ill .
And the winds whose wings rain balm
But when a nation takes a wrongful cause ,
To guide the rudder with his practised hands ,
The sun was setting in golden pride ,
And a weary road to climb .
Make it a rule that virtue shall be praised ,
My fortune is bound to be good !
All the divineness that within it lies ,
And windy capes that tried their slender spars ,
King agramant his infantry had spread
The sacred ichor , and infused the balm .
The cruel frost encrusts the cornland !
Tyr thought hard till he hammered out a plan ,
Nor disease has acted wisely ,
Noting the visages of some , who lay
I saw the marching flowers pass :
If man find not his voice in fervent praise .
She took the clue , felt death was love ,
Where her fancy and income permitted ; new faces ,
( when one poor sigh sends for him down )
Storm-winds blew them to the northland ,
The young plant fix its frozen root to earth .
Trying to hold the line ,
And reverently the band went forth .
And give the joy which lasting peace supplies .
His talks go down however rank they come ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Thus to make thee free and useful ? '
That men have brought to magnify thy name ,
The lilacs where the robin built ,
' thy secret pleasure turns to open shame ,
Courage , if sorrow come , to bear it ,
Turn night-time into daytime
But none could tell the hidden mystery .
That made the work of heaven stand forth alone ,
Doth loose or bind their blasts in secret cave ,
Felt all the waves awaking from their sleep .
Easy fall the heroes , victims
The clouds have left the sky ,
There lies the happiest land ! "
Expect always to hold a winning deal .
While all beauty lies asleep
A moment at the tragedy that had come
I could not raise this fervent prayer ;
Contagion caught the posts ; it spread along ,
Whose weightless cargoes , poured upon the air ,
Each charm it wore in days gone by .
“ and then the damsel felt his warm salute :
And catch a glimpse of brown and black
Who the tears you shed can gather ,
Which holds the new-born babe to blame
And wrath between us never to be quench 'd .
Soon to burst in tragic thunder .
But i with mournful tread ,
And once her sinking cause sustain 'd ?
And then love heard me and bestowed his kiss ,
His treasures in the royal palace lay .
And in a will resolved to find
By love the king will her conversion seek .
And every part a test of power presents :
Whatever it creates and nature makes . "
But wait till the autumn comes
The people 's champion spat his ribald scorn !
Before him hurled the argives , following hard
Alas ! to me this love will never come
Of comfort , may make offerings to you ,
And thersites homeward goes !
And step by step they followed dancing ,
Oh , loveliest there the spring days come ,
Was poured upon the field of battle !
Like clouds came floating o'er thy cheek ,
To her the vestal fire is given ;
We cower and strain our wasted sight ,
But to you , as time takes him ,
Old grudges forgot are put in the pot ,
Then close impetuous , and the charge renew ;
Some have escaped already . there goes one ...
And cursed with sense enough to lose their souls !
Before them death with shrieks directs their way ,
Bright with a glory that shall never fade !
May even thy tears pass off so lightly ,
Around the embers puffed and blew
With sorrow seized , in consternation lost ,
Does n’t mean the quest of pence ?
Of its owner awaken 'd their echoes long dead :
Well , take comfort ;
Whose soul the coils of death were wound ,
Of those who love the law , addressed :
Some boon of strength has nature given .
Such as comes if we have jail release .
My childhood 's earliest thoughts are linked with thee ;
To test the faith of peoples of the east
The fourth is raised of desperate pinceners ,
The azure flowers that blow ;
Where heaven lay confessed
To make new matter fit for tragedies .
The mohawk too -- with angry phrases stored ,
He shakes the feeble props of human trust ,
To make thy burden less , --
The printed passion of the dream remains : --
Took his father 's sword of magic ,
And the swallows will bring the spring ;
Nor break the feeblest link of sleep :
Turning attention to a prayer , thou ,
Ay , as a hunter mounted for the chase .
Which , naming erst the creatures , did express
I thought i 'd see what you would say
And leaves devastation and death in its path ?
To bounding joy , and make young pulses beat
Now is come a darker day ,
The gods both manly force and beauty gave .
His knife see rustic labor dight ,
Save that they see and own their king ? "
Hold life-long fellowship with rule and pain ;
Till he reached the strand of a distant land
Repents the pledge he gave thee .
No wild-briar with clutching thorns ,
And at his word they engage anew .
To make a semblance of existing merit ?
That wonder is , the body may suffyse
The sombre houses hearsed with plumes of smoke .
The creek went down with a broken song ,
Take the blind years as they might run ,
' mid vernal peace in peacefulness pursued ,
And the swan went pondering
A measured offering to fate ,
To whom christ shows his highest ,
The others noted well her unwilling mood .
A host of mighty vánars leads .
With the cud that made it swell .
To rule mankind , and make the world obey ,
That named himself the star of evening , stood .
And kindly books that hold me late .
Three constant pairs are ever found
With age 's hoary honours clad ,
Love them and breathe them in while brooding over
And deep winds piloted the shriven snow ,
Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union .
The hours , no longer silent , passed away .
A sudden silence sate upon the sea ,
Do thou look upon our sufferings ,
The infinite echoes hid in each .
How to the circle fitted , and therein
A box for charities , she drew ;
I would make you love me
Of shapely potency forward bound .
The sleepy eye , that spoke the melting soul .
My waking life is hid with christ in god ,
Her heart and broke its loneliness ,
Far greater slaughter on the christians made ;
Where the winter frost all day has lain ?
They rush 'd upon the foe ,
Winging the notes of his heaven-taught chorus !
And we gained the door of love 's abode
While death has set his changing seal
A shudder came upon me , then a fever ;
While with her radiant hand fair uma gave
And the bright motes danced in the balmy air .
Such conference held the chiefs ; while on the strand
Such grief as women in despair can show .
And she turned to me for strength and solace .
In tones where love and faith were sweetly bound ;
Than those which come by sweet contingencies .
" the journey you are bound to go ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
Their element , to draw the thinner air . "
I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away ,
Knowledge : this was the burden which was borne
In fate 's balance as it sways ,
Born i was to meet with age ,
For this same law doth bid us mourn
Where the azure skies lay glassed
Your spirit has filled , are pearls that cluster
Now while the dark about our loves is strewn ,
In which the parish chapel stood alone ,
From my poor heart , at which it fed
Through me you pass into eternal pain :
But soon as night and silence round us reign ,
Still the formula is found
We find a maudlin eulogy of sin ,
No help his life could save ;
Pass we the joys and sorrows sailors find ,
By stony brook that ran so red of old ,
Which adds such pure , celestial charms
To take a farewell of me ; for he feared
Kingdoms rise and saviours go ;
By his side i courted slumber ,
And their blood runs unto death ;
And he strove his grief to smother .
And with hole or half i 'd get relief ;
Then softly falls the word
October gave a party ;
The shameless suppliant at the altar stands ;
Even as a miser counts his gold ,
As on the gentle breeze the following words arose :
As though they trod out all my perished years ,
And whither go ye on your ways ? "
Thirteen , got fifty pounds a night ;
For why her face wore sorrow 's livery ;
There is waving of grass in the breeze
As thus in wrath he made reply :
Thou it wilt feel and own .
And the wild mountain land which my infancy knew .
Old shepherds , whom their hundred years have worn
Wherefrom i bring the whole of my transgression ,
Steel could the works of mortal pride confound ,
And she dropped me a curtsey .
What makes it snow ? '
To make a seizure on the light ,
Whose bold heart bounded at the trump of war ,
And pleasure flew amid sad dread and fear ;
( the fountains volleying golden glaze )
That is , to thy obedience ; therein stand .
A majesty we can not name , expressed
Chicago 's hope went tumbling ,
To whom his life and fame he owes ?
Who watched the leaping flame .
For i have kept conspiracy fast-chain 'd
I feel that i 'm wasting away ;
Her heart was filled with woe :
Who oft will shed the fruitless tear .
Up came the cloud , spreading far and wide ,
Let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither .
The wet boughs reach against the pane
Through the powder-smoke ran shouting
But here or there as strikes the player goes ;
How kisses fare , from night and winter wild ?
Even as the new snow covers up the old .
The golden magic clung , a light that shone
His living temples , built by faith to stand ,
Their nodding beauty shakes along the ground
So , sheepishly i laughed , and went my way
And through all life a quickening impulse ran .
And under bridges white its swift way takes .
This day my hand thy tender age shall shield ,
Speaking of heresy with flashing eye ,
Its height ascended , where two cressets hung
That slips the sheath of jealous night in may !
He is moved , you see ,
To pour my soul forth in one trumpet strain ,
A mother 's secret hope outlives them all .
And royal feasts their longing eyes invite .
Though most will note the scarlet and the gold
The holy hermit raised his eyes ,
Its portal , turned not once to heed
A boundless empire , and that owned no sway .
Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth ,
Take love from it , you take the whole :
Mr. penny , whose father was rolling in wealth ,
By how much of me their reproach contains .
A faint blush mantled cheek and brow ,
To help the stars go proudly by ,
How our lords make strife ?
May open through all mystery a breach . "
Hatred to madness wrought , each fine deforms ,
Shall rule the city , seated by the streams ,
And well to him may such belief belong ,
In the summer just passed over ,
It went to buy butter ,
His fame , to make it theirs :
But taking the year together , my dear ,
Who stands calm just because he feels it writhe .
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of may ,
By the fount which gave them birth ,
A planet also ? did it also move
To lands that lie beneath another sun .
The death-ship follows her track of doom ,
And with an eagerness that spoke
And opening new eyes on each new day
My heart is weary , my peace is gone ,
Which her dear mistress once held dear :
Coursing came he at headlong speed ,
Amid the luring of deluding joys .
Out of joy did joy come welling ,
Warm . distance cut off . seclusion .
Around his brows , and on his temples fed .
As sad hearts feel when first alone with grief .
But art comes dear the way the money goes .
I 'd take a hideous pleasure in
And friends like thee are swift to change .
With me , faith means perpetual unbelief
There was set before me a mighty hill ,
Autumn leaves that strew the ways
As the light breezes smooth their downy nap .
Pressed hospitable rites and quelled the fierce alarm .
Not kingdoms raised , but armies overthrown ?
And where love whispered of a thousand years
And if the ale should chance to fail ,
Upon no midway happiness will rest . "
New poison does mix in my cup of affliction ,
There is a room that holds
Go bind your sons to exile
Really to feel quite fond of ann ,
A good news should be given .
To hew the stately forests and with trees
Of pain and ill that human life must bear ;
Stars leapt and stared at earth and sea .
And the justice of god made manifest !
The flowers ' vanished hues and breath .
After one comes two ,
That my vengeance shall not reach him ! "
And filled and quickened by thy breath
" its frequent warning raised ,
And shipmates whom the terrible surge dragged down
From those eternal circles we departed .
Seems haunted or exposed . i always take
Slow twilight steals . by the small garden gate
It would not reach , singing the holy smile
That hides his murmurs in the rose , --
But bold of soul , when headlong fury fired ,
Of poisoning , raised against him by the friends
Bound up in a sheaf which god holds tight ;
A rare and undistinguish 'd fragrance made .
Of fourteen hundred years has whelmed not thee !
Thro ' the wave that runs for ever
Youth 's sunny hopes have set ,
' i reckon he 's a general at least :
Then leapt to life the flame of poesy !
His flaming ship , gives entrance to the main .
As the years ran .
Peace overspreads the sky with stars .
There came a ghost to margaret 's door ,
Blew such music as a god may frame .
Has come the bridal day
Let them make their journey homeward ,
Whence comes a line of continuity ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
How far my force in combat passes thine .
Who through the hush sends its melodious cry , --
Rushing upon him like so many streams ;
As feels a dreamer what doth most create
Through each bosom the tide of depravity thrills ;
The face of love no veil may ever dim .
His soul was struck with anguish , and the vein
Thus round my cottage floats a fragrant air ,
Which , brought together , would find loving voice ;
Whence a young stream , that trod on moss ,
Death 's terror is the mountain faith removes ;
Like one that had been led astray
By truth and freedom ever waged with wrong ,
She felt her heart grow prouder :
The universe unfolds ; all properties
Soon makes the wing 'd armies retreat .
Of loving hearts , that gone before
We should guide our wayward or wearied wills
A sumptuous drifting fragment of the sky ,
And now he falters , now comes on ,
At need , and made her beautiful and fierce ,
Was the victory lost or won ?
Having thyself the journey made , i swear
Where leafy boughs to shade them twined .
The ferryman his single oar yet plied .
Hath spared your fields the scarlet dew
The heart ; a mouth whose passionate forms imply
And threaded the recesses , penetrating to the foundations of
And i , who have been lying in this pain
And languid forms rise up , and pulses bound
May fill out the life that to you remains .
That sche hath broke hire chaste avou .
For , as her image stood arrayed
A darkness has brushed them . the mass
That brings repose to weary feet .
Filled with the pulsing joys that life can give ,
From off the eternal altar flowing ,
A countenance in which did meet
And a pale cheek fed with a flickering red ,
They made out a list of his property fine ,
Let me have all the freedom i have lost ;
A flash of lightning , wherein came its wish .
To be set in a precious time beyond
From the lake the mist ascended ,
Where morning round it rings .
And stood beneath the wall . eleven strokes went ,
And my youth comes back to me .
So suddenly , from her that held him dear ,
And arched the roof and gave it all the dower
Close where the blue gulf tosses its ceaseless waves ;
I felt thy smile and left results with thee ;
A bird of prey , with talons reeking ,
Lustre sweet it would give to thorn ,
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
And breathed magic on it .
Where love lies bleeding now .
If you submit , the thunderer stands appeased ;
But , where the road runs near the stream ,
Red life in its thousand veins is boiling ,
And they reach up high , to see .
Should make a vain capacity .
Thus with his wings his body he hath brought
He moved some arguments of small avail ,
With thoughts that lie beyond the reach of thought ,
About her , as a guard angelick placed .
Or he 'll be going to join the dead ;
How small the thread that holds up happiness ;
Where'er their footsteps stayed or strolled ,
Once in her arms you centered all your joy :
But unto them a true foundation gave ;
When wine makes all parts plyant ?
And served men nobly , and acceptance found ,
Up the thin dizzy strip of a pathway which led
Let none oppose th ' election , since on this
That in the roses take delight !
Dost make no question of my gentle blood ;
All my days will pass unhappy ,
These verses shall retain their label ;
" to take all this filthy temptation from thee ,
And his sweete waters away with him led .
Can circumvent or hinder or control
It is that youth expended life too soon :
Hints down of parian beauty and lost charms
His restless steps , as if compelled to wait .
That beauty and the moon were made ;
To sway the seasons , and to make it clear
Who murders time , he crushes in the birth
Depart , and bliss thy steps attend . ”
A tranquil , settled loveliness ,
And plush cabs drop into the stars .
Nor has death thus overcome you ,
Who , shaking and breaking barriers not a little ,
No earthly throne gives warrant to my voice ;
And run the risk of barring one truth out .
Back flew achilles with a bound , the length
And happiness too swiftly flies ?
Shuts the blue eyes and winds her sombre shroud .
If no delays can move thee ,
And all the clouds that hang above them flee ,
The breeze came in with the scent of pine ,
From it arose mists growing into mists
To plead a sorrow darker than the tomb .
Yet habits linger in the soul ;
And i first got a pledge of promised grace :
Which makes boys tremble when at school ,
And filled each pause the nightingale had made .
Already bows to truth :
And joyful from the shore withdrew .
And made his passage over otho 's heart ,
Till the sun was gaing down ,
To break the chain that sorrow wears --
And pleasant savour came from them .
Which made the people laugh .
Death dawned ; heaven lay in prospect wide : --
Turning your backs unto this troublous hell ,
A jollier year we shall not see .
What wealth the show to me had brought ;
Anticipative of the feast to come ;
Swiftly thy ardent troops his flight pursue ;
For sympathizing feelings warm the breast ,
And proud oppression coward distance kept .
Kept his counsel , took his toll ;
Oh , but to wrap my love with flame !
A suitor showed himself ; i can not say
Though not a sound thy soul hath caught ,
As silence holds the voiceless air ,
She shall feel their pantings near ,
Where the mighty bastions stand ;
Which make this life wretched and miserable .
And they are rising through the hollow world .
When the worlds have passed in night . "
In sportive dimples traced ,
That happiness came not before the end .
With burdens hard to bear ,
The wind is rising ; it seizes and shakes
A sound like that sent down at night
Gentle gawain felt as should we ,
Like the flowing of a summer gale he felt
The mighty womb that gave him birth ,
Why curse the pain that made thy soul expand ?
And lighted in the midst ; amazement held
Silly rich peasants stamp the carpets of men ,
The thought i threw into this snow shall stir
It could not hold a sigh , --
The first drawn blood of freedom 's veins
Could keep him wise and pure for aye .
And faint with anguish heaved each sigh .
Of secret , wondering joy , the mourners fill ;
That heaven , which forms his home above ,
To press some care , some haunting sadness down ;
Politian . touching those letters , sir ,
Music can soften pain to ease ,
When the last shadow fled in sullen haste .
By lifting to heaven their eyes .
As the moons were waxing , waning .
The city rests for man so weird and awful ,
Then age comes on ! to habit we
And i suspect , when pains and troubles fall ,
That those night-loving wings had poised
With folded shadows and doves cooing ,
He for king agramant shows little care .
And the wind arose and tossed it ,
That neared the ripened wheat .
Now comes our constantly increased reward .
Draws the dreaming world to love .
Against the stones at last bore through the stones ?
Who brings the light of knowledge down , and draws
Their deeds are read , they heave giant sighs ,
What wealth those simple flowers expressed .
Of inner movements gain a sight .
Those hearts which piercing sorrow filled .
No answer came ; but faint and forlorn
Prophecies leaving , eternally new ,
Folded through winter , spring spreads down again ;
And bade its many pulses beating lie
And godly sorrow moves them to be sad ,
To see through years of robbery and shame
Moles of good-luck led me hither ,
Are made to hear the moaning sighs
The winds blew fresh , the bark returned ;
The fields where breezes pass ,
" your riddle is hard to read . "
He was first served whatever blessing came .
The weary wheel to a spinnet turned ,
What we sought to bind .
The thousand arrows thou mayst dread to feel .
This spotless lamb thus offered up her blood ,
Nor thetis bore , but rugged rocks sublime ,
A countenance in which did meet
Your lovesome labours lay away ,
To henries mercy found that they must trust ,
My rhymes no longer shall stand arrayed
This each one felt and found
Nor shalt thou , by descending to assume
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street ,
Then i shall make you half afraid .
Call into mind the fury of your might !
No visions wrought of sleep might such love shake .
Up sprang the princely pair ,
And joy comes back to the world we know ,
My life most gladly give --
Into my inmost soul it goes ,
Darkness has come upon me in the end ;
I gave him all that he required from me .
And rough furze crept along the ground .
The sea i sail has never yet been passed ;
And lonely thought stole musing on to prayer ;
I tread below my feet that go ,
Only a mighty sadness fills
Therefore a mighty muster was being made ,
When scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings ;
And then i faced about ,
But time brought a change his diversion to spoil ,
Who thus his thought and fear expressed :
Their trojan foes to tread the grecians down !
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose ,
Of israel , his way the duke pursues ;
Of harmony , in tones and numbers hit
O , there were other duties meant for thee ,
Lay the proud usurpers low !
To break the blast of winter , stand ;
What gen ' rous manly bosoms feel ,
And fills the solitude with wailing words ;
As music unto the hand that smote the strings ;
Shall you search for new adventures ;
Behind the mist my virgin ramparts lie ,
Until that beauty dreamed of many years
Folded hearts where secrets hide ,
A hiss went of a snake .
It may escape the courtly sparks ,
As if our race were held of highest rank ;
Which clipped my heart and showed me evermore
Found some sweet word to say , --
So that its own appearance it maintains ,
That ' twill a singular effect produce .
Magnificence ; and what can heaven show more ?
Of hope to rise or fear to fall :
Religions change , and come and go like flame .
So little such oaths mean .
And touch the lute , and range the dance ;
Cold in his arms it lies ;
As the banners flare and the brasses blare
" my god hath given me years ,
Grown wiser for the lesson given ,
Sat down and passed into another song ,
Leading to universal knowledge -- see ,
Would lap blackfriars wharf , where london lads
In clouds of dust was titan 's face enrolled ,
And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands .
A little snake put forth its head .
For though your tongue no promise claimed ,
What gives faith to me when i pray ,
Whom life and death had made forever his ;
It was not hers . she felt a trembling stir
Creditor trying to get money from king ]
Nor causing any deed . this world 's lord makes
Its tender bosom first made warm ,
She carries his portrait in her little heart ,
With wonder-eyes and hands that reach .
The sun had now declined , when in that grove
A lip , that such fragrance discloses ,
And conveyed the mournful story ;
And the blood ran warm in my veins ;
While autumn winds are up and moan
Where the clear water sings alone .
( there they alike in trembling hope repose , )
Make the best of what lies in it ;
Hullo ! there goes the bell for tea ;
The babe lies yet in smiling infancy ,
From skies all cloudless fell the thunderbolts ,
As have seen service in the truth , and bore
And catch the burning sparks that fly
And power and strength from the ten horns received ,
Will take a richer glow . but wintry death
Enough to pierce the heart and chill the vein .
Till life 's short span is taken quite away ;
And why his generous arm should justice raise ,
The list grows long of live and dead pretenders
Or i know the clouds will frown and lower ,
Nor catch the little laughing breeze
That light will pierce my useless lids -- then grope
Too well i know by sad experience bought ,
Sae knit in alliance and kin .
" that scatters spells on herb and flower ,
So when the year takes cold we see
While the still morn went out with sandals gray ,
Thy nerves have scarce regained their tension yet ;
The brazen spear , and backward drove the dead
He pointed to the dream that still held true .
No snow unto that limit doth attain .
Carved flames that would not shrink or pine .
Here , where the moors stretch free
Your brows freed from the crown that made them ache
Of solemn woods . the rills that beat
To follow her , in girlhood from the world
Glory to heaven on high , it said ,
Ready to fall in tears of wine ;
One hour and more than half another , stood
No comfort in these cruel words i find --
My pain i could not feel .
And oh , we feel thy presence here ,
What power sufficient can he see ,
Thee spend a sigh t ' accompany my tear .
Scouted those chilling forms that banish 'd ease ;
Folk of the land it had lapped in flame ,
Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness .
And up the sky the ruddy sun came winging .
Which made thee all that nature meant thee .
But there enigmas also knotted be .
Only a steady murmur seems to come
All of fierce gladness in it , bidding leap
A distant age asks where the fabric stood ;
Through his broad belt the weapon forced its way :
Upon the roses it would feed ,
Each art , which thy fond care has tried ,
They feel the shivers in them dwell ,
Such contest hath arisen ; thy servant 's voice
I heard that his hamlet fell fearfully flat ;
As out of a cannon comes the ball !
Few leagues removed , we wish our peaceful seat ,
Law can discover sin , but not remove ,
There it lay on the molde ,
The rights by heaven designed ;
The more good earthly vigour it possesses .
The schoolhouse stood with pines about
That , could their import have been seen ,
The answer on answer that following came .
Those old great trees that rise above the mist ,
With the pure essence ; holy thoughts that dwell
Became religion , and the heart ran o'er
Thou canst never hide the moonlight ,
The moon had come to mean only betrayal ,
A storm that tries foundations ! even now ,
As blossoms mince it on river swells .
Among the gathering clouds , that strew the heavens
Great guns let it blow , high or low ,
And to the hapless dove dealt wretched death .
From paris we went for the season
Hers by love is bound in woe :
And the great look of love , long hidden ,
As fits a warrior race .
That the eyeless should read as he ran :
While shouting nations gaze .
The violets lent it to you .
As the celtic craftsman makes ,
Is spangle-work of trembling dew ,
He came to pardon fatherly those pranks
Again returned the scenes of youth ,
It is the things we have that go .
And pilgrims who have strayed to view
Yet stand they here enraptured , as among
As nearer to thy shrine she draws : -
But none the less his saying gave me fear ,
The afternoon , all glow and glimmer , came .
And oaks bear dates very plenteously ,
And gather in that drop of time
The sunlight fell with a golden gleam
Till words themselves grow sick with praise
That leads the heart from all its aching
The unworthy name throughout the lists convey .
Within it lay five golden rings ,
Thee i see , and thee i long for ;
That rises high over them , barren and bleak ;
The lord then made the brooks to flow
Yet it found a double death ;
Death 's hollow hand holds water of sweet draught
And truest king , she strongly pressed :
No nearer than the morning when there stood
Till we could almost see the steeples shine ,
His face suffused with rosy glow .
My one chance went ;
I know the savors night can give ,
That every tongue says beauty should look so .
And memory gild the past .
Stole all my roses , spread his cobwebs grey ,
The speedy gleams the darkness swallowed ;
That follow their footsteps as they dance
With angel thoughts surrounded christ 's young chief ,
Where never a grave should find us .
It asked a crumb of me .
He kept his circle round and round ;
My tears distilled into a song .
Where taurus from his fountains feeds the stream ,
That ever made a youthful heart less steady ,
Fine forms from greece , and fabled gods revive ;
That gave us th ' electoral stem ?
The shining mail-plates flows the purple gore .
Our yard is fixed with double bails ,
When the old summers surge into a new .
They say , let love and light be given
The golden link that made the meaning clear .
As outward signs show the disease within .
' as once in triumph david against goliath stood ,
Chorus ( as the king descends . )
Love owes its chiefest victories ,
Thy rugged lines of all do lie forlorn .
That made the modulating harmony .
" let this head forever serve thee
So each of them kept fixed on me his glance
As a crown set upon a weary brow .
The hand of blessing hath , trembling , laid
And weeping made the outrage known
The minster-clock has just struck two ,
Wondered who thus had stole their skill .
Who counts no cost , no peril weighs ,
He took my heart as wi ' a net ,
Hath power , directed thus , to bend elsewhere ;
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment .
To hold the added sweetness of a song .
That cruel hangman love his hate had fed .
The tears i shed must ever fall .
And kept the country-side in fear ) ;
His action just and give him cause for arms .
And when i came the weary hours were sped !
That tremble made the everlasting air .
The fragrant white violets veined with azure ,
The wind is passing through .
To lay out fortune 's gifts ; and niccolo
The kind of heaven which comes to this .
Nor durst my heart declare it waxed afraid ,
You have turned deaf ears to others --
Keeping time , time , time to its beat ?
To follow her , in girlhood from the world
Where the life that we led was a revel
From the regions where winter eternally reigns ,
I had called down such blessing upon him --
Of any spark from the altar catching there --
Could stop that worst of vices -- propagation .
A memory that brings languor flutters here :
The nation , and the trojan arms laid down ,
And thus the listening throng addressed :
As it it felt the tempest in the sky ,
Had made the mightiest she had ever known .
' how beautiful they stand ! ' they owe
Deep the sleep that settled o'er her .
With mouths wide open , catching tears .
So my soul held that moment 's heaven ; --
The thick sobs choking in his breast ;
To feed the fancy of admiring man .
For a goal that never nears .
Her troubling eyes that can not rest ;
Ravenna hath maintain 'd this many a year ,
I will take a torch and set you afire ,
But plain it is , the thorn is bound
't is a sign will never fail . "
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
My child to make thy mother mourn ,
And time 's full top casts down a pleasant shade
Welcomes the rightful heir unto his own .
The love ye bear the dead ,
To pass th ' impenetrable gloom ,
The passions that consumed his restless heart ;
For ever may roses divinely blow ,
A righteous hate was born . . . . .
Grim spectral souls , that harboured hate
Before the moon was made ,
She gives a sigh and said adieu ,
Here , where the waters wind into a bay
In holiness , may set up any crime ;
Alert they drew the sable bark aground ,
The storm hangs low ; the angry lightning glares
Lie waiting for the heat to pass .
Every cannon breathed forth hell ,
Alone the shade of darkness lies :
Though sad things stay and glad things fly ;
To those who bear the noon-tide blaze .
She lowed , and quickened into life ,
The madcap maid , with a smile that betrayed
So cities fall , so perish kingdoms high ,
Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights ,
Priests of its past had taken form
In rome and other part has filled the throne ;
And sucked its essence : warmth for righteous work ,
Shall find protection sure .
That for the sun 's love makes its bosom wide
Her charms forgot , forgot his native home .
Look how the yellow clearness , streamed across ,
They had made many a wound .
This flame without more flickering would stand still ;
Need good and evil , to see good , --
That gulphy streams from rugged caverns bore ,
The water whispering from the birchen prow .
And fast and free it ran ,
Never gave the enraptured air ) ,
By the soft breezes fann 'd ,
The charm o ' love shall reign ,
Now are your wishes come true , come true !
And stayed the wine , everywhere flowing in rivers ;
The great new dawn led on the day .
For the pathway leads to nowhere ,
Whether ruin 'd already or going to ruin ,
Is read the grief she will not speak ,
And all our hearts were dancing like the sea .
The awful life that to your trust is given .
He takes for accidental things of trial ;
And you moved among these mysteries ,
Still find its master . but their fears prevailed ,
Can quench the living light in even these ,
But as each mass the solar ray reflects ,
I saw , of course , how matters lay ,
He will hold high feast on saint michael 's day
The way before is marked by thee ;
Flashed pride and love ; he spake and smiled
With secrets hid away . _
Of alien discord , echoing from afar ,
That other men still go accustomed ways !
Two hundred years are mist that rolls away ;
And they betimes shall dim with woe ,
The palace echoed to his daughters ' cries ,
The tears that bathe our offered hearts ,
Which once they worshipped . then the lust of power
Were banded to oppose his high decree ;
And bid the shadow of earth 's grief depart .
Having found vain the hope of reaching the fruit .
The shadows of the massy temples lie ,
I fit into the walls and they pull me .
When the gust hath blown his fill
This poor heart will break ,
Then , when the dawn began to break ,
To my sage counsel therefore did i turn .
It led me with its childlike charm ,
The soul came issuing at the narrow vent :
Nine days they fell : confounded chaos roared ,
Was seen slowly to skim the silver lake ;
While i am striving how to fill my heart
Then came dark moments ; lady , then i drew
That the clouds lay thick about ;
How the blurred labels run on the old jars !
Whose merit dare apply it ,
Wreath of daisies twined with wheat ,
The chief his order gives : the obedient band ,
There comes a rumbling sound ,
To show their deadly rage .
Its pathway , which the wisest fail to spell ;
May shake them out of their complacency
't was he that raised the crowd .
Neither can show quite how they would be loved .
They stole for her the rose 's blush ,
By crossing terrors wildly tossed ,
And great patroclus in short triumph bore .
Grey shawl , and leaning on the wind ,
And make my porch a favourite seat .
And policy regained what arms had lost :
I let the bridge stand o'er the abyss !
Catch added beauty from the afterglow .
Contrite i see the folly of the past ,
Her awful burden she must still sustain ,
Where even a homicide might come
That sweeten victory : the balance sways
On tortured ugliness that twists and cries ;
Downward the narrow stairway led
The wanness of his youthful frame , that speaks
To all the sensual world proclaim ,
But none made answer to her . "
And truths divine converting pain to peace ,
These made up the fairy-land
My unfortunate fingers at once caught the powder ,
I may not pretend , through teaching , to find
O that those lips had language ! life has passed
Of priam , wo and wailing found within .
Whom good orlando 's arm had put to flight ;
The gully-rakers go .
With all that love that i must die concealing ?
That manumits ; that calls from exile home ;
Witness and evidence are what they lack .
Who mixed his honest blood with dire disgrace ;
To make them forget his age and smile
To hold the respect of those you know ,
In melancholy murmurs died .
Had england a hierarchy formed all of wits ,
And a stench unto my nostrils .
The currents strike or miss
My earliest scenes were laid .
And sorrow may live in the air
For in a world to freedom once recalled ,
The features traced of hill and glen ; -
If we lead a life of pleasure ,
Without you i 'll not capture my great song .
There shine some genuine smiles , beyond her power ;
And taught the painter , ere he drew ,
On wings that made sweet music in the air ,
But her sweet face , made pensive by the thought
The ghost of his black adversary rose ,
Which was to teem with high communion ,
Like swallows gathering for their autumn flight ,
Descried not him who gave the fatal wound ,
And all the craggy mountains yield .
The wind speaks only summer : eye nor ear
Sweeter than sorrowless heart could raise ,
Which gave some fears of revolution ,
It served them for law and for gospel too .
Or find sustenance in shadows ?
With dropping blood , the severed head . ”
Thy wealth my love bestowed :
As the saint miss the glories i relate ;
One and the other warrior made accord ,
The dread disease that none can stay ,
Again the voice commanded : ' now go forth
Whence glory-winged things to heaven have flown :
Hands whose great pressure hercules once felt .
To meet his favourite ’s wrathful look .
And thus addressed in smiling glee
And , duty guiding every thought ,
And ye , sweet flowers bear witness to the truth
That reaches backward fifty years
Are gathered as a cloud about man 's way .
That lends the morn her virgin dye ;
While yon pure ether feeds the stars with light ,
He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt ,
They drank despair with thirst whose torment grew
And their prayers round his brow in the heavens
From the blowing desert sands that rise ,
From the fusion of forces whence issued the spheres !
Who that feels what love is here ,
It is a man wrapped in woe ,
By sudden death , to give me ease ;
Round her fair brow the deep confusion ran ,
Fists savage as murder could draw ;
The icy currents which make their members quake .
Too well i know what that weariness means .
In calm , your numbers , closely pressed .
Was at the root of mischief laid ;
Only to yield thee gladness of my voice ,
Guiltless blood may chance be shed ,
And light unfading meets our gaze at last .
And the harmony drawn from those living strings
A wain bound east met the hearse bound west ,
Which let hope wither , and made care thrive ,
Drank on , and care gave to the wind :
And the keeper 's face flamed red ;
And this she gathered from the people 's eyes :
A thousand notes swell to a single chord .
Then came another song , like lullabies
Part of the christian people should be set ,
Scenes formed for contemplation , and to nurse
Each well-aimed bolt shall find its place .
By a confused sound that issued from it .
Writ in a language that has long gone by .
The dingy houses stand
And the bright sun broke forth , and melted all
Flung over every wave that swept o'er them
Look at the riotous folds as they leap .
So many a season rolled away ,
Trusting him to guide .
Contagion caught the posts ; it spread along ,
And bore me breathless and faint aside ,
That give a currency to beauty .
I 'm alive , you see .
He got it in an honest way .
Her sad appeal , lamenting much ;
Therefore on you is laid the task
Of a sliding cold .
Came the thought to her like balm ,
This firmness that i feel about my lips ,
Between the loud stream and the trembling stars .
Grim vengeance , yet , shall whet a sword
He served that law which rules the thrones above ,
The bird that veers across the light ,
Can i make earls by three and three ,
My spirit flew in feathers then
Thou wilt be gone , when night comes hither !
A face the craftiest statesmen scan ;
All swart and grim they go ,
Food to keep necessary drones alive .
Free pleasure comes and goes beneath the skies .
It ’s getting late , we ’d better push ;
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears ,
When courage cracks and leaves a shattered will ,
That sees thee breathe thy last ,
Metaphysics will claim your attention !
She arose , still smiling , with her eyes turned
Nostrils spread to sniff the sea-breeze ;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
Into which state comes love , the crowning sun :
Will break with april 's laughter on your lips ;
A gulf made by her longing , restless pride .
Loving too eagerly , they broke , and spill 'd
And following an ancient superstition ,
Cooling this cruel , burning pain for ever .
And , horned as ye see , and spurred along
Poet or patriot , rose but to restore
A beam of tranquillity smiled in the west ,
The sun blinks sweetly on yon shaw ,
Death-blows dealt the fierce marauder ,
Then was his heart with pangs oppress 'd ,
Like a flower laid upon a flower it lies ,
The heavens opened wide and clear in me ;
This rolling fort his nigh approaches made ,
So unto sin life gives his best . her arts
It fell in the dusk of the night
The raven-figured flag that led men fighting
He who long seeks a high goal unattained ,
I feel it when i sorrow most ;
Our maker knows , give him your fervent prayers :
The fleeting loveliness -- now seen , now lost ,
And feel the light unutterable shine
His life to hazard , and his country save ?
In delay there lies no plenty ;
What makes that ship drive on so fast ?
What murdering tory now relieves your grief ,
Near as they drew , achilles thus began :
The embattled legions stretch their long array ;
First enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls
That her young life is passed in woe .
Raise my dictating voice on high .
Shall find surcease but at thy fingertips .
Warm nature works and makes her creature fair .
Did make provision , thorough grace alone ,
Some wistful tale before the flames that grew ....
A poisonous hydra gave the burning wound ;
And at last we grasp the meaning
Or joy long pleaded for in vain ,
Of liberty that yet remains on earth .
Ruin has wrought upon the crowns of kings ,
The people dead to whom the sea was opened ,
And seemed inclined to faint again .
That sets all ears on fire .
That seemed to make us wise and strong ;
But man 's soul shining rich and rare
A little spark is followed by great flame ;
When water runs the fire shrinks ,
It waits till the daylight passes ,
Spring and winter have come together --
The music it was playing sweet --
' philosophy appears . the gloomy race ,
And lest is worth and goth to lost ? "
It bids the everlasting hills
They passed like fleeting dreams ,
Old time will make thee colder ,
The greenwood shade with lighter shoulders flew .
But the clubs found it rather serious laughter ,
Where from my threshold sank the vale profound .
Then nigher drew the sound of footsteps light
That floated , humid ashes blight .
Here where i crush me to the radiant sod ,
More sypher 'd woes the walls proclaim ;
Straight terror fell on him , and trembling bowed
What creed of wrath the saxons sanctify .
Hence then , and evil go with thee along
Forever singing as they shine :
Its gifts , transferring fame as fleeting too ! --
Imprisoned thousands , worn with poignant grief ,
And fell asleep again .
And fills thy spirit with a great delight ;
The carle he led sic a life ,
My mangled limbs for food will tear .
There are those who battle slander ,
Here beauty passes with her gorgeous train ,
Where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings ,
Which lies a-blossoming
Ropes rose and sunk , and rose again ,
So precept and example tend to show .
All the years that have gone o'er
That cuts the strained knot of destiny ,
For the calmest seas that tumble there
Forgiveness of the majesty it braves .
Then peace was spread throughout the land ;
And cry , if his tail got a chill ;
Twice i have moulded an image ,
That meets him through the changing nights and days
To sultry august spreads its charms ,
And summer is nearly gone --
Answered in the words which follow :
As the picture came before her
And add to these retired leisure
And thither went that baron silently ,
Then twilight came , and evening 's shade --
Taking and giving radiance , and the slopes
And from the other circles set me free .
Give him a friendly kiss .
Is breathed by the babies god leases there !
Swift through the gates the guards direct their way .
Where in her arms he finds repose .
In its own sweetness sleeps the flower ;
And straightway went upstairs .
Let greece then know , my purpose i retain :
Those thunderbolts rush on and down , because
So he went the words to gather ,
To gather tidings of his father 's fate . "
They hold not love 's diviner hours ,
In some of our own sex we find .
A flower or two which bear poetic worth ;
Whatever fades , but fading pleasure brings .
Night wove her web across the sun that died
And , offering joyful welcome , shout aloud :
All the gathered love she knows so well --
When juno to her handmaid gives command ,
These woes in living pangs his people bore .
Who next the goblet held his holy place :
More often comes the word divine
Raged and roared the wintry tempest ,
Across the perilous chasm which guards our cave ? "
And the heart that dreamt it still and cold ;
In perfect vengeance ? no ; in pity sent ,
Even as it lies for ever upon her coasts
I showed the mingling of mild remedies ,
The eyes you love through all the ages shine .
Making a song to ease his heart .
Th ' escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks
Their captured english seaman groaned his last . "
Of the great ocean breaking round .
There came on arthur sleeping , gawain killed
Where the water ran like mountains hie .
And the dust arose to heaven ;
All holy influences dwell within
Dropped pregnant hints at times that made me think
Was in her words displayed :
Itself unseen , sheds thro ' the face .
And thou wilt find that harmonies ,
Time 's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil : _
Could man in eden find his love ;
Sleep comes to chloroform the fretting mind .
If sever 'd friends by sympathy can join ,
And the rough hazels climb along the beach .
Who hath e'er felt the change of love ,
There came one drop of giant rain ,
Had caught a star in its embrace ,
Then were the first lessons given ,
As doth your rational ; and both contain
Where fairy water-breaks do murmur on
The fit occasion came
And looking to the joy that lies before us ,
Of earth above , descended into hell .
Sweet memories shall dwell with us ,
Shunning the future wooed the happy past ;
A look of satisfaction came into the tired eyes .
Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth ,
And be caught up to meet him in the
Thus we went moaning , child and mother ,
And more blasphemous ; which expect to rue .
But such as amorous arms might cast around
What visage bore the gorgon as the steel
With thy foam-cold limbs wound sweet
Was spared by axel ’s hand of thunder .
When the stars threw down their spears ,
Hungry for love that never came ;
And he held its secrets sacred ;
Should scan such secret truth ; for he had learnt
To critic and to flatterer stopped are .
The many years of pain that taught me art !
To lure the paragon of earth !
At intervals fierce lightnings tore the clouds ,
Honored because dark veils its form conceal ,
As the chill 'd robin , bound to florida
That rends its inmost leaves apart
Full seven years remained ; he castles took
Then rose a piercing cry from all
Beauties , like stars , in borrowed luster shine ;
Far richer in reversion : hope exults ;
In havock which warfare hath made ;
That hath bore up of a great while
To meet with unrelenting hate ,
Which added doubly to my former fear .
He finds me proud of my pondered rhyme ,
But joy shall come with early light .
Listening to catch the master 's least command ,
That hovered there awhile .
Hold each strange tale devoutly true .
His cross with faith unshaken will we bear .
But wisest fate says no ;
In standing on a rope that runs through eyes .
From the secret that lies in these wolds --
And could find my way to the sea . "
There stands the town of dandaloo --
Love , only love her forceless numbers mean ;
Where the hollows are banked with the violets flowering ,
And a rare token of that art to show ,
The doctors give and statesman 's art :
The affliction she bore
Thinking by dying to escape disdain ,
That sacred bliss with which no other can compare .
He cast a saddened look around ,
So , farther yet , he went astray .
Old hopes revive , new hopes are born ,
Shall we give our bravest to death and pain ?
Of life returned . with fitful quivering
His rags regimental they flutter 'd so gaudy ,
Were banded to oppose his high decree ;
Then to the river on it glides ,
The truce have broken ; and defeat and death
Rivers pour forth a stream of honey
The manner of my falling into sleep .
But now the northwind came more fierce ,
Thou hast seen the world 's decay , --
Than where men ’s choirs bid music weep
Could not see your heart of passion ,
We held by the game and hailed the team ,
Within the hero 's mind his joys renew 'd .
Spirit that moves the sap in spring ,
The river , curling softly by ,
To oblivion was borne .
To the vikings quickly requital was given ;
A smarter grief within me wrought
The roving spanish bands are reached at last ,
And the ultimate hour has come .
Moved brightly through the whirled and stricken air ,
Light falls the dusk of mild midsummer night ,
And death brought out of strife ;
Richly to find my sins forgiven .
And held their breath till all had passed .
Used she , but read the fate it bore
The knight 's confiding grace to keep ,
And taketh pleasure in her pain ,
Seek and find all that beauty can bestow .
That lay in the house that jack built .
Henceforth thy pathway lies among the stars ;
When sense returned to wake despair ;
Up sprang the wondrous multitude ,
For fear to guide , and visions to control :
Watch the strange shoots and foster the new flower
That strove to sing with voices drowned in tears .
New springs of life are gushing everywhere
The glance of manhood that god gave :
And makes the trojan seem of coward vein ,
Thy heavy burden i will help thee bear . "
Blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend
Long vanished filled the eyes with tears ,
And neither seek nor be found shunning strife ,
Not yet the sword has found its sheath ,
Is set under his governance .
And every wave that broke its heart of gold
His blooming views , and asks for your address ,
On which no ray of hope may shine .
Awaiting sale are stowed away . "
For youth , that does not come again ?
And turn his merry note
The wind that in the leaves and waters played
With delight their worth would tell .
But here the tortured body finds relief ;
The silly tongue well may ring and chime
There shone on soul and sense
Brothers in arms , with equal fury fired ;
Fame to you belongs !
Where are the joys my heart had won ?
Their counsel hung on his report and words .
As one who feels the breathless nightmare grip
His spirit passed , and crashing down he fell ,
When shall the harvest of thy fields arise
Eurylochus and perimedes bore .
We shall feel rise in us the wondrous wave
To chase the yellow butterflies ,
And a little snow had drifted
To show their deadly rage .
Defeat and triumph found him calm and just ,
And he dropped his line of cedar
Save that which cometh from the pure serene
Whilst cunning gamesters set the cards ;
But ere the third day came the french forth sent
And low in dust laid many a worthy knight :
Then came the spirit of the theban seer
Sweet science , this large riddle read me plain :
Suddenly , with the hour , there came a change
Those shining virtues which you muster ,
From noble ancestry is handed on ,
He grieved to see his eldest child take flight ;
Five times in lawful wedlock she was joined ;
The golden sunset leaves its ray ,
Soon as her blooming form the spring reveals ,
Before the sun rose , made the city bright ,
Which told her heart was broken .
Where vast olympus ’ starry summits shine :
The night came on alone , --
The basest weed outbraves his dignity :
And , as before , the smiling sultan gave
And he would call the fleeting year to stay .
In his compassionate gaze , grubbed smoothly out ,
And the mouldering dust that years have made
It whispered in the sunshine :
A promise my honor is pledged to ?
Like some lewd evil whom the fiend hath kissed ;
To make you happier , the fault is yours ,
That saw their farewell tears that night :
Until ' t was seated in his soul alone --
Regard for man would lead me still to trace --
Are close upon thee ; prophets raise their wail .
He seeks his proper happiness by means
To whom achilles , lowering , and in wrath .
Till the forenoon , proceed those banded friends ;
The soul of music sleeping in its strings .
With woe have penetrated all my heart .
Ten little years have made ! we all remember
' i have given my heart to a flower ,
Of wheat and barley wavered in the eye
Which in thy friend it richly hath supplied .
That , even as they dreamed , you stand
But from thine eyes my knowledge i derive ,
Have solace brought and wisdom taught
Dropping from leafy hollows , which it filled ,
While gradual parties fill our widened pit ,
By the pain that tested the man in us ,
And the red cliff roses bore
Already his great course has run .
He showed what charm the human concourse works :
Steals no comfort , no grief doth borrow ;
Here , where the mimic eagle glared in gold ,
Then ráma ’s wrath to fury grew .
Where nature in her beauty grew ,
Beyond the land where leichhardt went ,
Where hangs and swings a demon without pity .
Six dragons bear the dead one 's hearse
Fer joy around the room , and churn your head
Nay , set by what has been , our happiness
From the serpent he crushes its poisonous soul ;
To struggle with its foes , and feel it swell
He felt within as if his heart was broke ,
And made myself party to the false chronicles
The moon slips from a silver mist , --
I could not hear the laughter that they made .
Where only mournful shadows meet ,
Where thought hath swept her purifying wave ,
Weareth that form , which influence of the soul
( to the center of love returning )
Fair effects that roses add to beauty ,
Call my spirit to the fields above ?
At first he pledged a miracle quite boldly ,
His own particular fright , so these three felt :
The happiness of men stays not a long time ,
Too late they will their folly see .
There is no air the mind may not recall ,
Low as their feet and loosely swung :
A scent of musk or violets , sees the patches
And young reflection wondered and adored . "
Which lifts its head above the mournful sandhills ;
Whose memory of sound is long since gone ,
Carved with the torso of the crest that bore ,
Till whispers rose among the throng ,
No safety there they meet !
To bliss alike by that direction tend ,
Thy stars and stripes our strength have made .
But now a wandering land breeze came
My heart gives you love .
His reverence and his worship both to rest
Thus the mother urged her counsel ,
Over the fighters ' heads ; and a wind rose
The sweetness that soothes the wild bee .
And the old courage gone ,
Thou fill of heavenly visions sweet ,
She welcomed gervase for the news he brought .
And pierce my suffering spirit through and through :
Above the dappled clouds blew by .
Though she that passed had lips like pinks .
Perhaps my lines in praise of peace may live .
The town says : i am filled and fraught
The homeless winds came rushing down --
Meanwhile there came a sound of song
And has felt joy and anxious care .
Send their soft voice to the sky ,
And there her empty body was bestowed .
That sat within this changeful sea .
Expectant day by day , a month goes by :
Then silence on the still world lies ,
Soon must yield to haughty sadness ,
Who deal the laws men make to travel by
The good and evil tongues that trump thy fame .
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
Some smile or look of love to gain , --
That from my fancy took their being 's stamp :
And clouds that hid the horizon 's brim .
Is the air that caresses my sky ;
He did not even seek for wealth and power ,
The arms that fold her , from the grave .
They look to more than truth , and so confirm
And rode triumphant through the civil broil .
Taunt me with my mortality ? " weak things ,
He came in bigot pomp to sway ,
How late ulysses to the country came .
But ere i half-way reached the end ,
With dawn the tide went seaward , bearing her
Thus his sister answer gave her brother :
The year is going , let him go ;
When fortune smiles , her love to show ,
Wafted to caverns lost by hideous seas ,
Sound like that soft flute which made
We press too close in church and mart
But now there runs a hum
" what anguish must my parents feel
Seemed only to be tarred with evil --
Give consolation in this woe extreme .
Let the bravest take it up .
Like a bird whose heart is burning ,
And hid from him my heart 's delight .
Then it shifted to muscular novels ,
My heart broke beneath the weight
The honest hearts around him met : --
Still in thy song should vanquished france appear ,
The weary sunset has grown wearier ;
But a dark frown descending ,
O keep where that beam of paradise falls :
Will . what living get you then ?
The carpenter , whose faithful soul looked up
And some pronounced her pills delightful .
Were rooted from their hearts ;
As souls may , stooping from each separate sphere
The long red flats stretch open to the sky ,
From hence the malice of the deist sprung .
Ever filled the place with music .
And yet how still the landscape stands ,
What wonder strikes the curious , while he views
Feared , noted , bowed to for the very treason
Told where the midnight tempest came ,
Neither let it make thee angry ,
I see the serene brotherhood of philosophs ,
The northern rabble aims for greed ;
Broken-hearted , flushed with anger ,
A beauty that can never fade . }
In the very words which follow :
Some moody turns he took ;
March is slain ; the keen winds fly ;
And made his heart at once rejoice .
In full spring time when east winds fall ;
The works where ancient learning reigns supreme ,
His pious eyes fix 'd fondly on the sage ,
Queen mary 's saying serves for me --
Were quarried cups to hold the purple wine ,
And that apron still i see , --
And then , to go to sleep ;
And make one song of life and death .
Through his left eye keen throbbings shot ,
And juba 's realm returns the hoarse alarms ;
Together make a zone of the horizon ,
Not so it fared with scribbling man ,
Made outraged justice tremble , while their swords
The brass sky watched the brassy water flame .
And unto us those holy lights gave need ,
Of a great dragon winding out and in .
Be it so ! i 'll take fresh heart ,
Envious time about thee watches ,
When thickest dark did trance the sky ,
And swift cocytus stayed his murmur shrill ,
Where'er the passing current drifted ;
See what comes of stupid jokes ! "
A cloud now interposed between the light ,
Or melt the glittering spires in air ?
Dear to the god that gives us spirit of song
But when the summer night was now far spent ,
S -- prints , before the months go round .
And his evil blood to swallow .
For their love lost , their only gain
And dissipating mirth !
Would overtake the horizon as it roll 'd ;
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore ,
What understanding and reason may sometimes fail to accomplish ,
And the fridays and sundays pretended they
Ready with leaves and with buds stood the tree .
That make us ponder while we praise ?
I find the shades that veiled our joys before ;
We see the brick bat take his rapid flight .
That , passed unnoticed in the day 's unrest ,
Full of the snow that ever shifts and swells ,
He made sure to hit his mark ;
Discontented with the teaching it supplies .
Blossoms bring him home with may .
And darker shadows climb the russet hills .
It beards the early buds of spring
And laid his vengeful lightnings down .
Had caught a star in its embrace ,
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high .
There fame , and here above the mark remains ;
Ye clouds that on your endless journey go ,
The other yielding slow to joy --
I feel you , spirits , hovering near ;
The old commandments stand :
Epeius framed for paths of mighty men ,
Gently the zephyrs play over its surface ,
And give me more of that glad heart !
All the hours of life i see ,
The nod was that we gather for consent ;
To pay a debt of gratitude .
And he vowed , by all he held dear ,
And a gallant answer he gave :
To catch the murmur of the breeze ,
Thus the islander made answer ,
Confused and broken -- come and gone --
Seeds that the thorns of diseases may bear
Mended the heart , life could not heal --
It rolls from the golden long ago
( red rose leaves will never make wine )
Anticipative of the feast to come ;
Doth gnaw away thy health and leave thee sick ,
And not content till it reaches home ,
As the shoe waits for the snow-fields ,
Where shadows moved and ghostly spirits stood
With two capacious gates , as usage goes .
Dead lie the dreams we cherished ,
His precepts teach but what his works inspire
But taking note of these things , at the last
Were dancing on the rose leaves night had strewn ;
They pass from dreamy bliss to wakeful glee ,
Streamed the pleasant sunshine ,
What a world of merriment their melody foretells !
The dreary vacuum in my life to fill ,
As i see my belief come true .
Took him to bathe him deep round breast and brow
" thus i gained the information ,
And the widow gives the party .
The mermaids spread their flowing tresses ;
All day my thoughts had lain as dead ,
Superfluous matter came , shot out in ears
The dolphin seeks a quiet cove ;
Disdain 'd in marathon its power to feel :
I seemed to catch of such a structure sight ;
The throbbing heart of freedom finds
His sable locks all swept the plain , and all
But even-paced come round the years ,
Fruits tempted him to take their placid gold ,
And breaking into stars , an omen sent
Or he will break his wound afresh .
Asunder . they follow their orbits , we
Once more thy sinai-thunders rolled .
The flaming wings that heaven bestowed
First came a smell of pounded spice and scent
And there were sudden gusts that blew
Three weeks at least had come and gone ,
The cruel man stretched forth his murdering hand ,
And made the winter gay .
In courts and palaces he also reigns
And straight from his prison we drew him ;
A mother sits in grief alone ,
The sky was spangled all with gold ,
Have slain their slayers by the pest they spread ,
Before the night had borne the death of love ;
The joy half lost because not sooner found .
At the great sound of night that broke
When autumn comes an ' heather bells
So told as earthly notion can receave .
It trembles into death , but comes anon ,
A remnant of the days long gone . "
The words which placid sleep inspire ; which still
His brows were crowned with victory , his cheeks
I suffered him who took no bodily guise :
But o'er him came this thought ,
Whence the storm comes nor where it goes .
As visions that too soon will go .
Double its strength with years doth grow .
Not so is his care shown .
Where solitude sweetly reposes in state ,
One winter they had spent upon the way ,
This truth sublime his simple sire had taught .
A prize that passeth to and fro ,
All of our labor to sow seeds of gain
Let not a thirst for wealth within him lurk ,
Which made them so hard-hearted ,
They rip the bishop out of his tomb
And forest boughs , here sacrifice she makes .
Drink the sense the notes infuse ,
They feel not for the poor !
The day of our vengeance was come !
Thus made reply : " he is indeed alive ,
That carries age so nobly in its look ,
And shadows cloud the dear , sweet face --
In her ear the airy voices call .
And onward each rejoicing steered ;
And lighted the gloom
Out to shining seas beyond pursuit or returning --
The greater grief that comes but with the loss
As though upon the wings of time there came
" a glimmering thought occurs to me ,
Every child can take a ride ,
And who holds communion
For if a great rout he shall see ,
So centuries came , and centuries went ,
For he to his sovereign speaks noting but truth .
And every hope is flown .
The tears that follow fast ;
From his forehead sweat was falling ,
Thy ken directed to the point , whereat
His fervent purity , its impress wrought .
The winter winds arise ,
Where raghu ’s sons their station kept .
Others forlorn have found --
The boat that bears the hope of life approach
Unoccupied , has filled the void so well ,
Floats of the days gone almost out of mind ?
When spring , to womanly summer turning ,
To come in touch with mysteries
Why not on them have placed the forfeit crown ,
The tears would fill his cruel e ' e ,
Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied ;
Of lofty praises ; for there came to me
I prayed god put her out of pain .
Had thrilled so tense the marrow in their bone .
The charm to make them fair ;
Yet led astray by venus ' soft delights
While as he sank beneath his pain
A sharp and shrieking echo gave ,
He felt his temper quickly rise ,
Macedonia sends forth her invincible race ;
Wal life ’s sweetest moments wor flying away .
That follows after food .
With eye put out for breaking forest laws ?
Beneath the walls his active sinews plied .
With magic of flickering shadows ,
But fate , whose ruthless force none may escape
Who feel not honor -- know not faith ,
Bury thy sorrow ,
Warning was given , if yet they would repent .
Before a following wind , and round them heaved
To find in the sacrifice something sublime .
For him the stake prepared .
To close with one who dared to criticize
And took a lute , from which there pulsing came
Which heaven to gaudy day denies .
Celestial portents bid us forth to fare ;
Both armies on camilla turn 'd their eyes ,
Can ease the longing of the soul ,
One only can a woman 's treason shun .
He felt the warnings of the dream ,
Still waits with gems to set them gleaming .
We must get victory .
To find the cause of death .
Then sweetly glided on the stream of time ;
Then you find that he is different than you
That in my actions stand a man confest ?
To think good fortune had quite turned my brain .
The monster makes such spacious rings and clean ,
Light have ye still to follow evil or good ,
Yea , love 's great warrant runs not there :
Adds that sweet odour gracious nature gives ,
And strikes when justice prompts the blow .
Her color comes and goes ;
O god ! that men would draw a little nearer
We struck at slavery ; to the verge
Curtaining away the golden sunlight ,
To place the poor upon the rate .
When jove himself added a handful of hail .
Thy sleep makes ridiculous .
And fate will use a running noose
Lucretia every line might trace
A picture my poor words may not portray .
To earth , to earth each thought was given ,
Has but one comfort left : all triumph would
In the present edition the preface is restored .
The night bends over , weeping . in the street
The summer 's song her spirit to me bring .
Gathers the flock of faith from every land
When the baby 's gloomy christening came ,
The world is governed by one cruel god ,
The outside rough perhaps , but filled
Wouldst see the truth , and in her ways
He then , not finding his chaste spouse within ,
And their most righteous customs made me scorn
Let the little feet go faster
Dead seemed the legend : but it only slept
When truth is found in falling tears ,
To match the pageantries of kings ?
Orlando 's wasted wit as well he takes ,
Perhaps the battle will not go ,
To catch the fleeting whispers told
Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch :
And , deep beyond , the trailing clouds that slid
Of the husbandman 's heart made strong
Who makes me see i to destruction haste ,
Sumantra closely following .
Where the loved are meeting beyond the stars ,
On their feet with spring-vines tangled and lapped
At length arrived the wedding day --
The mightiest still the fight maintained ,
" these follow me , " the season says :
That fate has unconsciously molded ;
Love went grieving , -- love who saves :
Pass from the face of her fame :
All in the moonlight at thy portal laid .
To his departure . this at length he adds
And mark it for a rapture nobly writ ,
Music and books led the glad hours along ;
With a pang piercing sharper than actual pain .
Blossoms bring him home with may .
Each heart recalled a different name ,
Into his heart the chill strikes up ,
So father will mend the rooster 's head
Handed down through ages yet ,
We 'll seek the coming day with joyous mind !
Elusive thrall , to doom or stab or bless ;
Oh ! the bitter tears they shed ,
Rose crimson , and deposed the stars ,
His voice passed like the zephyr 's breath ,
Drawn outward by the vampire-lips of sleep !
And it shows men a sign of how sacred joys
He gave command the pair to seize ,
Nor mark the tints the copses wear ;
All go to swell his love for me ,
The constellations meet , but through benign
And the brown beard curled close around his chin .
A monstrous wish , unborn till virtue dies .
Who knows him set in some great jeopardy ,
The throbs that seemed to shake her breast ,
Yet pensive thus his sighs did tell his care .
It gained the master 's praise .
Trouble and ignorance are gone ! the light
Scepter and power , thy giving , i assume ,
And lay , drawn up to cool and timeless bliss
The soothing earth to brighten april 's wonder .
Nor had their vengeance borne so long delay ,
The wind is driving toward the east ,
All stop and charge the faithful flames , that they
The doctor 's self would hardly spare ,
God 's living image ruthlessly defaces ;
Like those the avenging furies purged were these ,
His simple truths did andrew glean
And scorn was ever standing bye ;
A tear , which memory 's hand had taken
A vision came ! it was not in the hour
His arts and gifts had offered to bestow ,
It came with the threat of a waning moon
And hearts and heels kept tune in tremulous ecstasy .
To keep collectors off , have all run smoothly ,
And leads the world to heaven .
Like that swift followed by the thunder 's crash ,
And such the lust that breaks his nightly dream ;
Part crimson dyed , in manner as are passed
So when aurora sought orion 's love ,
Youth or sweet nature could bring forth
And draws the spirit most unto itself ,
Whose heart still felt a sympathetick glow ,
More faith in what it means ;
For italy 's the whole earth 's treasury , piled
At the stern he took his station ,
And notes and talks of ensigns they display ,
For madness such as they have always shown .
My shroud of white , stuck all with yew ,
A young wife 's beauty quickly fade ,
Tancred alone of her escape took heed ,
Till billows rage , and gales blow hard .
His singing i no further trust can place in :
Then lakshmaṇ moved with sorrow viewed
They bend ; the demon leads the dreadful band ,
At the sad sentence rigorously urged ,
Who could such doctrines spread abroad
Around them set the spikèd thorns .
Than others , hatred to our faith he bore .
Here , merchants carry trade to such a height
With immemorial dust , it lay ,
That comes from weary london 's
The hills display the beacon 's friendly light ,
Had the baron placed his forces ;
Glittering as serpents which , with spring renewed ,
To thy imperial race from woman rose !
And in your joyous errand reach the spot
Nature reduced that stock to utter death .
Britain , stand fast !
The grief that clouds thy lovely brow ;
Sustained me , and strong arms around me flung ,
As leading to the hermitage ,
I had not thought death had undone so many .
As might be gathered on the downward way : --
Later the solitude vanished , confused and distracted the road
As leads the galaxy from pole to pole ,
Hearts that beat the old , old tune .
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw .
There came to my ears the sound of speech .
In monstrous union life combined with death .
But cold oblivion seeks to fill
Taking flight through the dimness of night ,
And that was where he made his mone
O woman , stamped with some bright heavenly seal
Death consume as a thing unclean .
And , deeply moved within their bosom 's depths ,
Take the good the gods provide thee !
The kiss upon my brow was sadly given ,
Whose names long since grew into me ,
Whose fate to distant homes confined their lot ,
Rest in the pleasures which thy deeds have gained .
And when the heathen had at length grown shy of
Must it be done to undermine the state ?
Many winters i found a worthy following ,
And joyed to hear it swell .
Ideas die and old religions perish ,
The hounds went romping with delight
Which turns from sorrow with disdain ;
Forfairn , worn out ; forlorn .
Now hangs as mute on tara 's walls
Do not look at life 's long sorrow ;
Far extend the sky and waters ,
The sea keeps not the sabbath day ,
My soul still helps me read each part
The clouds have begun to frown ;
And felt such comfort as dispelled her fear .
That suited the case , you see .
Where law and justice doth take place
Four swans sustain a car of silver bright ,
Its marble walls bedecked with flourished truth ,
When they feel the pangs of sorrow ,
That dwarfs the petty love of one to one .
So let it stand among my rhymes .
Like the black-earth made my visage ,
A sum to trick th ' arithmetic
Nor give such tales the lie ,
In meaner quarrel if this sword were shaken ,
My sky is black with small birds bearing south ;
The perfect law of righteousness -- and strove
Each day a dreary year appears .
The same mute planets rise and shine
In days gone by ,
Spite gnaws the factions ; for thy conquests won
As few could match beneath the throne ;
Amongst the angels stand .
Within thy paradise embraced , --
That a second sun might follow .
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud ,
Or as some shock cuts off relief
Of my remorse is shed :
Nor catch the little laughing breeze
How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed ;
Their voices melt in welcome dreams of spring ,
Look southward , where australia hears your voice ,
Who builded that contentment should be with
Till they have made our town a wilderness ?
Here is the daybreak entering the festival !
A riddle where no meaning shall be found .
And he dropped his line of cedar
Where horrid shades enclosed me round about ,
To his inner self earnestly turning .
The angel of summer aloft i see ,
Yet breathed no heart one thought of fear ,
And there in secret held discourse with witold .
The constellations meet , but through benign
Radiant palace -- reared its head .
( as mortals count pleasure who rush through their day
In such a time , give thanks to god ,
She leaves thy loving arms , thy tender care .
Which counts the answers and the gains ,
" o great pure deed , that hast undone
That freedom 's flag shall bear no stain
Soon hurries me back to despair .
One nearer kindred than life hinted of .
Of time and law falls in .
Shrubs and flowers lead the stranger
As much as nature fashioned thee to feel . "
A voice i felt , unheard , though near ,
Of doubt and reason and falsehood found ,
It paid best then to pull trigger ,
With purple soft and shaggy carpets spread ;
Of his free bounty , who had made them apt
Who lay , promiscuous , by achilles slain :
The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare ;
And left a haunting fragrance in the room
The mind must fix her haven of rest ,
And towards his athens bears the lovely prize ;
When , his pulse failing , passion speechless lies ,
And a music rang where the rivers run ,
That shone from a nunnery .
The moon poured down on tree and field ,
One duty lies on old and young , --
And thy sickness shall depart ! _
And their sad hearts with grief were wrung ,
So long as the world contains us both ,
As the clock goes tick-a-tack ,
_ the lonely sunsets flare forlorn
He worked . the shadow came to haunt
Now , my muse , thy powers summon !
With blood , the strife they still renewed ,
With dewy wreaths of early violets wrought ,
Then winter gave him strength , and fraught with rain
Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom ,
As when i fell a-sleeping : ---
Protection when the fierce storm blew ;
How some day he would see the difference ,
Where wounds of deadly hate have struck so deep .
That living song which life can give ,
The robbers into gruesome durance drew .
But poets raging with poetic heat ,
That round about me lay .
The brook its frozen architecture makes ,
And tell the meaning in a mother 's eyes ;
Can dim . all beauty emanates from soul ,
His brow was heavenward turned , his face was fair
The wintry west extends his blast ,
He notes the season glories come ,
Softly the stealthy night descends ,
I will show no anger needless .
Of human hands , they can not reach to grasp
Follow thou thy young wife 's wishes ,
Rising , where thought is now denied to rise ,
Have felt the torment of another 's grief .
The thoughts that arise in me .
Love arose and went with me
Shone , his great teeth shone in his grin ,
I told him the smell made me sick ,
Justice gives way to force : the conquered world
Swift rumours pass , that every one must hear ,
Who are these that follow across the hills of night
The shadow of our fame is growing !
The fruit to ashes turn , the gold
To bharat then these words addressed :
And could words follow she would ask his aid ;
Yet it lies in my little one 's cradle
Raged and roared the wintry tempest ,
That they had got the trap to fear .
Driven by an onward-ache ,
No fashion made them apes of her distortions ;
Great heart , that felt the soul of things
Put on the plumes thy lover gave .
Are shining on the sad abodes of death ,
The clear lake shining at tarbelus ' feet
As fits the holy christmas birth ,
Where many a splendour finds its tomb ,
Scarce could my bounding heart its joy contain .
That called eliza to the silent tomb ;
Steal from their prison places to bear us company .
He heaved a heavy sigh ,
The axes bear away ; but who the string
For tho ' she almost blush to reign ,
The memory of sorrow grows
The universal , which now stands estranged and apart ,
And loud the acclamation rang ,
And the twelve candles leaped to flame .
Beginnings that have here in beauty stood ,
To him , who makes another 's blessing his .
He saw him decked with wealth untold
Wild rushed the hot tears from her eyes ,
The ocean of ignorance separates us ;
Are broken in compassion of her woe ,
The air was still , the water ran ,
And none shall know the pangs i feel .
To give the wounds they will not cure ?
It were a sin to steal a kiss , ”
And the cutlass shivered to sparks and dust .
Scarred and shabby it went . we espied it
Vanished as dreams fade . cool and fragrant went
My memory loves to hold her , as she first
And , flying , upward he his breast directed ;
With shifting shadows dusk , and strange surprise .
Who paid good blows . romance , farewell ! "
And i mixed the sweet music of auber
His scepter shows the force of temporal power ,
Follow me down , and a voice follows after :
Nor moves one feature of its giant face ,
How fast they hold like colours of a shell
As the moons were waxing , waning .
Musing , beheld the northern winds prevail ,
Into his thoughts ; his love of beauty woke ,
So long a time would last my tedious strain ,
Is lit with pitying eyes ,
The wind that blew upon the sea
He looked and found them wanting ; and as now
True things hereafter will declare it to thee .
And , after homage paid , bawl out aloud
For when the summons to that village came ,
Wast ready to reveal the truth it bears ,
Wi ' the tears that lie behind .
And when all echoes of the chase had died ,
A smile that spreads a sunshine
Stern tyranny sweeps wide o'er india 's ground ;
Their blooded steel was flashing ;
The heart that suffers not will never melt
For that the day shall come when sacred troy ,
To make the field of battle shine with fires ,
Which a godhead of love had wrought .
Beneath the daisies , there they lie !
By some whom we did count our friends ,
Their standards led for earth , none guessed
Live unabashed if the arguing world stood by .
In leaden hues of desolation fade away .
Forth issuing thus , she gave him first to wield
The toil it takes to make a business grow .
Their souls with joy to fill .
" true love gives true love of the best :
From her eyes of beauty flowed .
That books had stored , and intercourse refined ,
Why mighty cities fell , quite overthrown ,
Where we flung our gutters against the stars
Entranced , and lost confusedly ;
Should come with song and glow
And shall stem the blood escaping .
So sad a sigh to heave ,
Where rávaṇ held his royal sway .
To make it happy as those isles of rest
At length there came the step upon the stair ,
Which makes thee wonder ; and so purge the cloud
To lift unto my lips the hand of him
Waters the odorous banks that blow
Panic and fear still waited on her steps
At length , when friendly darkness is expired ,
Will tickets to their ladies presents make ;
And answer thus made he ; -
And apollin , whose holy laws here run !
When quietly the darkness covered all .
His flesh , red nectar and ambrosia pour 'd .
And find each other good ,
Will feel fatigue no more by night or day .
And take their proper size here in my heart
Whenever nature gave it as a form .
Which rests irresolute , and lets it lie .
To share my fortune and my name .
When the light no moon allows ,
Whose soul gave way beneath the pain
The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end .
That thou as a knight by me wilt stand ;
The grave clothes off her trembling footprints swept .
Ah ! when winter winds are swinging
Herbs of every species flourished ;
Even birthdays were passed so ,
Swift was thy tread when these proud nations fell ;
With the crucifix he wore compelled my gaze .
Of all the centuries yet to come ,
The growing life was severed . for what crime ?
Each crept into a monster hive .
Mouth mastered a sweet sound ,
Heavy the burning impulse raised by sin .
And where corruption was employed
But o , thy deadly words recall :
Time be spent , and life expire .
On such an eve the heart doth grow
Clear as the waters of a brook that run
Now while the earth was drinking it , and while
Demeter sad ! the wells of sorrow lay
With eyes that breathed of hell ,
Sleepy the forest , nodding sleepy boughs ;
It glared around with fierce electric eyes .
That lay in the house that jack built .
By making me thy sacrifice ,
The love , that raised her innocent
Or show a coward 's fears !
Those clear bright waters from the font are shed ,
No gloom that stately shape can hide ,
I cut out false hopes which endanger your life .
Should there come the best of suitors ,
The morning comes to consciousness
The countless summers came and went ,
As each day her troubles brings . --
Still melting there , and with voluptuous pain
Then all the world will join thy sweet
The monarch goes forth with tiara of flame ,
Thoughts of his fearful deeds will rise
Beauty alone could beauty take so right :
And snored to beat the band !
The butterflies that soar and sail
Before him power divine his way prepared ;
And all pretense of late relief was lost .
Thy tribute wave deliver :
The birds that break from grass and grove
Men staved the crimson vintage of romance
The forward young men manage spear and shield .
That like real things my dying heart do greet ,
Went out again her wandering way to take :
Looking for a kindly answer .
Misrule followed misrule , and justice fled .
Which god keeps by him under the throne ;
With its too much of glory . what he brought
Wine ran ; rich yellow wine upon the marble floor
Now the snail hath made its ring ;
And to new ones gives birth .
Rippled in blue , or sending from cool depths
From constantine that lay therein , who swayed
Celestial plaudits sweeping through the skies
Where nine locks secure the treasure .
" the night must fade and wane ,
When our anguish changed to rapture --
To find some cure this plague to stay . ”
But the wave would make music above us afar --
The fire so hastily it blazed ;
" descending hence unto the lowest powers ,
And left no less an ardent flame than i.
Would give due thanks . his gorgeous train
Yet , mingling with these sounds of strife ,
Concourse in arms , fierce faces threatening war ,
To outroot thine evil genius ,
The tears you 've shed in silence
The pointer ranges , and the sportsman beats
From the cold and frost collect them ?
To bear such sorrow and my doom . forgive
Or as rivers run through valleys ,
Frosts are biting , clouds are snowing ?
And fettered fast before they further went .
And the willow trees their shadows throw
That keeps , till june , december 's snow ;
A gleaming pool lay among the iris leaves .
Fierce passion in her bosom woke ,
Of gathering thought , re-limning life again
The games all closed , the people went dispersed
Draws it -- the deadly point surveys ,
Joy that he has taken , living yet .
For many facts we see which come to pass
Had found in nature 's self a tongue ,
That thus in safety magnus ' flight was sped .
Our city gets new governors at whiles --
Angels through whom god executes his judgments .
Thy song could make my soul forget --
With echoing footsteps all the funeral went ;
In parts superior what advantage lies ?
Is prudence joined , for i have suffered and wrought
And put his house in mourning several weeks , --
He went to his act of mercy , and when
With full swelling canvas , the waves she plowed ,
Could there dig and make his fortune . "
A wicked whisper came , and made
Yet lay the beast unwounded ; safely sheath 'd
In the meadows of life we strayed together ,
In charter and writ is the tale expressed --
The islands rising in our eastern main
But life gone breathless will she reinstate .
Silent and soft , as saints remove to heaven ,
The blood flows forth to fill
And with his mercy washed and made them fair .
To war and arms i fly .
That came to seek the hidden gold
She sported with her paramour .
To make us feel existence , and to shew
( while the twitching body mocked the sun )
I leaned to catch the words he said
Then darkness hid them with a rainy scud ,
I heed thy call to prayer .
" rather than you lay down your liberty .
With one accord join battle all the franks .
But fearful to offend , by wisdom sway 'd ,
Of manhood to the scaffold led ,
By nature meant to bloom again !
For your wild tears make darkness all too bright ,
But the mob swept down like leaves in a storm
A youthful cavalier she seated spies ;
And she beheld the riches which they brought ,
Lifting the torch of your freedom on hungering faces
Like lava in the dying glow ,
A quest that led through many bitter years ;
Her curious eye sought out her chosen knight ;
Then came the call , and he went away ;
Expectant of that news that never came ,
And war went down the darkling air ;
Lest his heart take fright .
They hit me with kisses vicious .
" what is the lay for love most fit ?
My breath caught , i lurched forward --
" o lay the cause on youth yet immature !
Here easy streams with pleasing murmurs creep ,
But feels the primal blessing in his blood .
Never doubted clouds would break ,
Make haste to take your pleasure while you may ,
Or led by hopes , or dictated from heaven .
A shower of kisses bathes thy smiling face ,
The snowy trilliums crowd the forest 's floor ;
Grasses to the mass he added ,
Each day the ocean sinks , when , rushing round
No kind of instrument to make it sing .
Old laughter catches in my throat
The light in which was smiling my own treasure
On my neck to bring destruction .
A whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side
“ blew back the ribbons which her sandals bound ;
Till comes the time for passion 's sway --
And i think the rations has made them ill ,
Ran swiftly , and with trembling hands made haste
So first found healing , poisonous as it poured ;
With ev'ry deal his fate has planned
Whatever wind may blow ? "
That all may find much solace in their king ,
The thing that made me more and more afraid
It will stand , we foresee ,
A mirror joins , by guilty chance ,
Answered in the words which follow :
O let me feel that thou art near me ;
In contemplation passing still his days ,
Their line , descended from no common race ;
Yet make his sorrowing subjects dwell on both ?
The slave whom no longer his fetters restrain
That smile when she treads on them :
That carries us o'er the sea ,
And now with shouts the shocking armies closed ,
Messiah 's lore had flourish 'd there of old ,
See the whole vision be made manifest .
These demons burn mankind ; but most possess
A hundred muskets answered that appeal .
Which quench 'd , then lay it up again
Letting them see we have sullied her so .
And a zephyr can stir it to grief .
A sound came from the land ;
That only serves to make us grieve ,
Wings that can bear me back to times
For knaves make friendship to betray .
A thousand years hath it borne that name ,
For thee old legends breathed historic breath ;
The sun came in ;
April had covered the hills
The faith which takes of its own blood to give
I feel the gales that from ye blow ,
The moral is : a fox is bound
Fired with the charms fair science does impart .
The wind , blowing lonely , moaned like surf ,
Sacrifice there , and all these rites observe .
Flash 'd round him images and hues , that wrought
Till rising gales should tempt him forth again .
When his mother 's life departed ;
The fountain sang alone ;
To seize some features from the faithless past ;
And look through nature with creative fire ;
Through law ; perusing love will show .
And their conduct amounts to an honest confession ,
From his footprints flowed a river ,
Long centuries have come and gone .
And loving still , the downward way she trod .
In furious battle mingled , neptune sent
And a myriad suns have set and shone
Bearing his soul within its glistening arms ,
The plot my farce aims to possess , -- }
When wintry winds do blow ! --
And , as on his failures he sadly reflected ,
The little clouds went by ,
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
Which only woke as living waters sprung .
The moon gives you light ,
The splendor falls on castle walls
With his secret knowledge made it ,
And war 's stirring tocsin pealed ,
In all those things we put into our prayers .
Dear than the dreams our summer knew .
Infinite pity set in calm , whose vision cast
He puts him there in foremost rank ,
And found no welcoming cheer set forth ,
The damsel put the pair without reply :
I find now only unrest
Till babylon was builded , and arose
And what it calls _ discretion _ preach .
With heavenly voices raised their song
His time was come : he ran his race ;
Buried in sand . at length they struggling rose
The heart aches on , the link is gone ,
Sees nought but sadness in the character
To feel her breathe and hear her speak again !
When the hour was come prince chun arose ,
Of demons felt the throb , and knew
I wander as it leads .
In the misty forms that eddy and whirl
But could not follow for the moon which rose .
And the glory of an age was passing by .
As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam .
And passed the stormy wave ,
Two instruments belong unto our god :
That lies too high for base contempt ,
And the yellowing leaves fly thick and fast .
Thus to be foiled by flying straws of chance ,
This dark old yew tree casts a fuller shade
But one draws out from the beaten ruck
Thy spirit parted as it came ,
To follow half on which the eye dilates
And drive our nervous fears away .
At this juncture , some one inside coming to raise
" something has come to make us young again .
That brought its tameless passion and its tears ,
His arms embraced in loving hold ,
While still the floods and winds were held asleep .
And stood content to rule by wholesome laws ;
The tall towers rose like pillars ,
You seize the flower , its bloom is shed ;
Then dropped a curtsy , far enough
And as her life decays her joys increase ,
The shadow deepens down on the karroo .
My heart stood empty and bare ,
Where the vision led ,
At every act sits godlike in " the town
But soon it all run through ;
With eden 's joy her pulses beat .
And bearing high of stately womanhood , --
At this voice saw i many little flames
But i my father ’s word will keep .
The mingled joy that flowed on every sense .
From his sad hearth his sorrows ruthven bore ;
Left him smart as they are made .
As down i went by rye and oats ,
Of idle hopes , which still do fly away ,
The music stopped and i stood still ,
Could not stay his tears of sorrow .
The honour of the sex survives in part :
My heir that comes would only bring
The verse beneath my name and action speaks :
And listening feels that neither joy nor pain
Athirst for war , his way he took .
Fifty years ! every day passes
A glorious canopy appeared to rest
Borne in his heavy car , and demons have lifted
Of midas , which his greedy wish ensued ,
Passions , like elements , though born to fight ,
In the faith that looks through death ,
Seasons may roll ,
And harsh the weight i bear .
Sought the pure shrine which held the fire ,
The word they take , their ancient deeds relate ,
Had nothing else to fill it . now my art
And from a hope in christ its blessing took ;
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it .
Until , when seventy came at last ,
The trees and leaves speak trembling to the wind .
Others to tread the liquid harvest join :
With restless hand the bolt that breathes out fire ;
The heart of youth turns ever to the light ;
The red that fires the southern rose ,
Sweet flowers that turn to heavenly fruit ,
On this the goddess cast an anxious look ,
And they their empires and their worlds retain ?
Her braided locks that waved sae light ,
Each grasping limb and held them fast .
And the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow .
A holy family , that make
Very soul of life to save ,
Any straight road leads afar
Headlong from thence the fury urged her flight ,
Such sights as from the myrtle high did pass ?
That far into my heart it found the way :
The pensive shell doth borrow melody .
They made their court , like jupiter of old .
Dante deals freely with the figures of the apocalypse :
Geology opens the mind . so you know
So horror stricken at heart i feel ;
Which the eye might follow onward ,
Was hurled once more against the rebel flanks .
Tried to make her people happy . "
His head lifted to face the star country ,
They may not see the heavens unfold .
The hearing gave new pleasure to the sight ,
The scheme was tried and it succeeded well ;
Whose arms of love would grasp the human race :
If taken with sobriety .
But all things carry the heart 's messages
Iku-turso gave this answer :
As chimney-sweepers , come to dust .
The gods let slip that fiendish grip
It lifts the boughs , whose shadows deep
And now the torch of truth is found ,
War and bloodshed do they bring us ;
Marvelous darkness shadow 'd o'er the place .
This heavenly nectar which i bring ,
And the pleasures come and the pleasures go ,
Night comes upon the earth ; and fearfully
No ease , no pleasure my sad heart receives ,
Will she , with joys encompassed long ,
With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves ,
And chased it all away .
With mournful gaze began to peer :
The monster to the sword , part sentence gave
And noxious airs begin to crawl along ,
May secure the thing of evil ? "
The verses in this collection originally appeared in
Larger constellations burning , mellow moons and happy skies ,
Is void ) , the same hath made my cemetery
Scatters his freshest , tenderest green .
Above , a golden glory seemed to hang
Than far from this grey light to lie ,
Past doubt her wisdom , taking from mad war
Of as splendid exploits as the world ever knew ;
Smoothly and steadily its course is steered ,
" i come to tell thee thine approaching fate .
All which makes other women noted fair ,
If they be wounds which such sweet teaching makes ,
Unnumbered ghosts from earth untimely sped ,
For there , where smoky clouds are spread ,
A visible essence from thy beauty breathed , --
Can all be dead , with silent sleep possessed ?
Where the champac 's blossoms shine ,
The ladies lift soft prayers .
Cold winds of death go wailing past .
My contrite heart with inward sorrows bleeds .
And the terns that darted among
By the pulse as it rises and falters ,
Burning the brighter as the shadows fall .
The spirit is not found save through the flesh ,
Her dresses make a mocking sound .
And strengthen the steps of age .
The daystar 's healing light is thrown .
Till a swift terror broke the abrupt hour .
Some fiery pang hath rent his soul within ,
And leaning back , he yawned and fell asleep ,
And large repose , the peaceful valley lay ,
Her brow with golden circlet bound ,
One born to win , and hold command ;
Let carleton arm his antichristian might ,
And from rebellion shall derive his name ,
His body will make me a nice little stew ,
His friendless , homeless spirit roves ;
Set forth like lightning which saturnian jove
To logistilla 's holy realm addressed ,
So on he went to fame and glory ,
Troy never wronged ; i came not to avenge
Which seems to feed the flame of happiness !
For the month of marriages is drawing near .
For now divided hearts , with hate aflame ,
In the mead the emperor made his bed ,
But long lashes veiled a light ,
Blasted my gourds and laid them low .
Of talking and low laughter that buzzes all around .
Soon must yield to haughty sadness ;
To grace the crown grief weaves ;
The wing of my spirit is broken ,
The great creator ? but their spite still serves
For heaven must yield to vehemence of prayer .
Like a lyre , swept by a spirit ,
As many a sleepless hour can tell ,
To gloom hath near consigned us ,
He must take to his wings and fly . "
The border slogan rent the sky !
And now his grief may be compared well
All , worthy idols of a faith that sees
Friendship like this can never fail --
Indulgences were set to sale ,
Nor silver vases took the forming mold ;
He spread his hands in benediction
No fell disease should taint the air ,
And on that night he made a little song ,
The dead tide lies immovable as fate .
Tears will spring where woes are deep .
Rivers of gold through every landscape flowed ,
Two grimy hands in friendship joined --
The spartan hero ’s chariot smoked along .
And black , their shadows doubling them . the night
And with their scent the air is filled ,
The joy that stirs throughout their tapering height :
Till it sorrowfully trailed in the dust .
To claim a kiss from sixty-two :
" the western wind came lumbering in "
Its frost and silence -- they disposed around ,
Bowed down by woe , with troubled mind ,
That ever tried the plaintive strain ,
But spurring up his fiery steed ,
Would weigh on my heavy heart for years .
Deceitful peace lay all around them .
The little index , pointing , told us where ;
What demon spells in lonely forests braving ,
The lord in zion laid for him ,
And unavailing tears profusely shed ;
That we may freely passe forth our way ,
And isabella on its music hung :
That , budding kisses curled with blown desire ,
Up from the valleys came song ,
All lovely colours there you see ,
Saracens stretched on the green grass bare ,
My heart is weary , my peace is gone ,
To keep me happy all the day .
" we think with the devil he deals --
The boon devolving gives distinguish 'd grace .
Then my thoughts flutter round me
And the heralds brought this message :
Thee tyrant earth once held , imprisoned soul ,
For in the life aught else can give ,
The city lies , fat plenty in her halls ,
She felt his pleased eyes read her face .
Which brought me here with pamela
Has made me scruple whether that same night
Are lost once more in sadness and in song .
The pit 's eternal pains to feel ;
O gods and goddesses , who viewed with hate
The past to explore , the future to reveal .
Full in their front a silver cross they bore ,
The world is filled with folly and sin ,
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee ,
Still gnaw the old transgressions bitterly .
When to the valley breathed we long farewell .
How many books thy history contain ;
Flamed as the universe rolled from her lyre .
And curling smoke ascending from their height .
Words of magic round it breathe ,
All night the red flame stabbed the sky
Before the stars have left the skies ,
And kings the forehead on his threshold drew --
And every field resounds her monarch 's name .
Where genial stars lend warmth , or cold annoy ,
So the long days went slowly drifting past ;
Like outposts set in the lonely vast
And fruit that knew italian skies ,
Well shows that verdant were its spring tide leaves .
A windy winter you shall see ;
And a calm came over the sea ,
And thought leapt out to wed with thought
Where never an emperor can break in and steal ,
God give me courage to trust
His task austere of penance plied .
As separation builds its pathway of tears .
Fall mighty numbers , mighty numbers run ;
My song might shadow forth that saintly smile ,
How a strange sea-monster stole their bait ;
So oft the colors changed , went and came .
Thus both their haughty colours struck ,
A lover came to woo ,
Lost i hurried , hunted by despair .
The love we veiled was daringly revealed --
And charmed swift healing from the fresh-strewn reeds
Quick was the preparation made ,
That flung its shadow on a writhing deep .
Shall tell your soul the reason why .
If from my lineage any such shall rise . "
This soul which on thy soul is laid ,
Till i knew the ultimate end had come --
And all the distance had been gained by stealth .
Nothing remains but love , the world 's round mass
The wanton 's prayers prevailed , and by a night
And cupid makes wings of the warrior 's plume .
Give vent to their feelings of gladness .
Sound and entire , mark well the lore conceal 'd
Misshapen hump-backs shock the sight :
Most boldly expose corruptions foul crimes ,
The keys committed of this lovely flower .
And my spirits gushed and bubbled like a fountain
Because 't was never made to agree
To swallow flame , and never take it ill :
As if love 's sampler here was wrought :
When hope lies dead within the heart ,
As the lashes of light that trim the stars :
His massy spear with matchless fury sent ,
Into love 's tortures falling .
Then into her eyes the tears they came ,
He left his blessing , not his curse .
Take your fill of all this laughter ,
Their coats of bark about them cast ,
But place and passage yielded every one ;
Thy church shall praise .
When fortune followed in my train ;
And warmed the womb of earth with genial beams .
By night reversed the labors of the day .
The lessons love can read me . " yet again
" times change ! but memory still recalls
Many dreary days have wandered ,
If her patience turns to ire ,
The soul of him satan away hath borne .
" only bad men go for asking ;
That the eternal beauties it unfolds .
Long following beauty 's floating flame
As in a paralytic , left my limbs
Where the flame of sunset only falls ,
Wha should swing in a rape for an hour .
The mountain sat upon the plain
Tuned to israfel 's music in the sphere
She thus some trifling doubts express 'd .
No nymph his inexperienced breast subdued ,
Who watch in woods when pressed by foes .
Forthe thei went these zemen too ,
Though they lead apart to-day .
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend ;
And adds discourse , the medicine of the mind .
Which prayers , sighs , tears do show her ,
That dance within it where it moans :
In light that fell from his whiteness holy .
But late at night he lets it hang
And night to glorious morn gives place .
Death quench or evil stir ,
The youthful rovers follow .
Light and life to all he brings ,
Where tall the frequent poplars rise ,
And judge what clara must have felt !
A stream of tears did run ;
His soft-lead pencil still went on .
And made them ponder what he had to tell .
Angelic spirits guard thee round ,
Much lore we leave you worth the knowing ,
The promises and empty vows dispersed
Wept , looking often from his face who read
Which forms his only _ ancient _ study ; --
First to himself he inward silence broke .
All else is engulfed in o'erwhelming emotion
Giving as much of ardour as it finds .
Scores of sins w ' ave made here many ,
With earthly uses ' -- made him quickly dive
Beneath her hand arise the potent strains .
She stood as one within a waking dream ,
Matilda her terror no more could conceal .
In martial pomp to shine ;
To her his subjects humbly bend and bow ,
And so no harm it came from thence .
The king has called a council to discuss
It would give me joy unceasing
Then romance lived and breathed and burned .
Bolt and bar that held the door .
The summer dews that fall ,
The future would not stand . precipitate
Which they expected faster to come on ,
We only held it for a day -
As rose-leaves hold the dew .
A nation felt upon its heart your hand ,
You see you 're rather young . "
One , nature ! burns and makes thee bright ,
The following changes were made to the original text :
Where the miracle lies anchored . "
But a voice changed it . glimpses of such sights
And the wide roof returns the mingled notes ,
The sun itself sees not , till heaven clears .
The flutes were hushed that mimed the orange moon ,
Still at the prophets ' feet the nations sit .
Hissing and whizzing through the skies it went ;
What made it black but the march wind dry ,
Which art , not nature , makes so rare ;
His gospel shall be spread ! "
Was traced a line of lightning .
" these may make the wife
And all the time the building took a slant ,
Which meets the enraptured gaze . how should we fear
I to the poet turned , who gave command :
More primitive , and all arrayed for doom ,
Which meant his soul was wild with fun ,
The hardy roots locked in their silent tomb .
That lay imprisoned in the cold white keys
His lonely thoughts would often stray
Then into his hand went mine ,
This saw ulysses , and with grief enraged ,
Recklessly spilled ; the nubians ran to pour
Her lost and wandering ones recall ,
Of rolling incense , and of lighted taper :
Will hold its strength unbroken , and go on
Its cargo , made of pleasant cares ,
Feel my fettered spirit yearn to thine ,
And the flooring swept and polished .
A strong man 's arms about her body twined .
Who gave a certain kiss .
Men clutch madly at each weapon -- women ,
To gather into brightness as she gazed ,
That gives , and asks for nought .
With love that ne'er shall wane !
And to the neck the river mounts .
And not feel my sorrow 's share ?
For still the azure orb as she draws nigh
Seven other saints he fixed on high
The veering sound of bells ;
' gainst the tribe which held her captive .
The lilacs where the robin built ,
The storm moves on ; and winging
Together move in fellowship without end . --
That rests upon the " golden shore " .
With conflagration glaring at each crack . --
Chill graves the sexton delves ,
There lay a landscape gray and dim --
Where he for debt was laid .
The gay who find aught to wake laughter ,
Will time take this joy , too , away ,
In his verse , tears , sighs should fall
Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed ?
They lifted up their voices in their grief ,
Redeemed the promise made by thee .
And little feet that could not reach the floor .
The emperor makes here his harborage .
By deep prophetic winds that come and go
To leave undone what crime or craft could dare ,
The hawkbit shines with face of cheer ,
Each felt that hunting had its charms ,
Happy happy time , when the white star hovers
His beard swung on a wind far out of sight
A call of gold is floated from her ear !
To keep law and order in the village .
Those open eyes that showed the death within ,
The ray of morning on his eye lids fell ,
Omniscience makes all-loving .
The flowers summer 's lavish hands have spilled .
May ever hang with fresh delight ,
About the sombre woodland seems to cling
Mere ghostly head it skims along ,
Which god keeps in me , i would give away
Go lightly on your pilgrimage
The body of the king was set
Even bliss was humbled by the thought --
As if the spirit of the land pursued ;
Through the cool , cool winds as they pass ,
That held a far off town of many towers ,
And bathed in blood , and joyed to slay ,
And match and blend thy words with curious art ?
With the love which the world its good children allows
But longer in that paradise to dwell ,
That opened in the midst a woody scene ,
A flood of bitter tears outwelled ,
Then unto trumpet and horn they take .
Yet ere that day was spent i knew
A lover would not tread
Is given , and trial made with full success ;
Endless , and no solution will be found :
His fame , to make it theirs :
We school our lips to make our hearts
To meet it with a brother-kiss ,
The meek moon walks the silent air .
The helps that god has given .
Raised reverent hands , and made reply :
As of a god whose virtue never fails ,
Still falling chokes the swollen drains ! i know
No art , no care escapes the busy lash ;
All winter-bare , had on a sudden leapt
Just as god leads i am content ;
Of broad estate , won from posterity ;
The style consummate which has made me known .
Led by the wizard beauty high ,
They justly raise contempt , or hate ;
By that sin fell the angels .
Extremely taken with his own religion ,
I rather feel inclined to wed
Where the spirits seven do show in heaven
And oft responsible when grave mistakes are made ,
And may this charge a conqueror soon recall ,
A resolution , or enlivening thought ?
And sought the eastern side .
Of cloud grew violet ; how thy moment came
Till the lost sense of life returned again ,
In eastern beauty , pours its light upon
Which made it more surprising ,
That dim blue room . her perfume comes
That fills thy soul , of sorrow bred ,
The dawn came in , and glimmered on the floor
And my prayers are wafted o'er him ,
Still the angels leant in silence ,
Love , love had claimed us long , and long
And found sin in itself accursed ,
His subjects , and the cities leagued with rome
And his dread thunders rattling in the sky .
Who sprang for liberty once , found slavery sweet ;
It filled the listening heavens with prayer .
Fear stirs the pulse and drains the throbbing heart ,
And over my head the waves have met .
That bring the fog and mist .
And god sends pain .
And whine at the hurts that they feel .
To his embrace that fine unbodied shape ;
The beasts with pain their dusty way pursue ;
The druid christ has taken breath
He thought and wrought to please and heal .
God spoke , and it came out to hear .
That shadowed his life with new danger !
Last came eumelus drawing to the goal ,
The soul assimilate , and make her great :
As chimney-sweepers , come to dust .
And one grim shadow creeping ever nigh :
Or such who harbour pity in their breast ,
Sing of the golden season coming .
Deep in my heart the words are stored ,
Even these words went echoing dismally
Oh , it makes me too ill to continue ,
I took resolve to share and serve their needs ,
And all that kindled at those earlier numbers
Again scored victory over me ,
That boston served her keepers !
The winged wanderer . let it go or stay .
And shed a terror through the city streets .
Whose eyes watch dully the green branches spread ,
As round it died the sunset 's flame --
Then added , with impassioned cry ,
What makes existence _ really _ nice
And wearily went colan 's hands
Its mouth all drawn with heavy moan -
Jostled commonplace glugs who dropped aitches about .
One wishes worship freely given to god ,
Where'er this light is shed ,
To give false witness taken pains ?
The long forenoon my thought i held ,
Would he barefooted o'er it go ?
Before the sun rose , made the city bright ,
It shone as a monarch 's crown ,
As stars in gathering shadow of the evening
Scarce touched ; the other thundering pressed the plain :
The summer clouds pile up and fade away .
Do they beat thee , that i meet thee
Parting the midnight , entering my slumber-chamber ,
He calmly all their insults bore .
And the legend , i feel , is a part
What words can tell , what words can praise
Where light or where love might dwell .
Pale , faint , and all with sorrow worn .
Which , when the cannon thundered , could but stream
The wind swept back to the jonquil tree
High on a throne the king each stranger placed .
With triple stars , that casts a trembling light .
But coughs will come when sighs depart -- and now
And each loving the other thus , our hearts went
So fare ye well ! and hold your tongues ,
How wit will run on wheels !
Slipped from him . ah , it made him glow
The reaper has left the field ,
And conquer would again their houses lost .
Maddening and torturing as it went ;
And the soul issued at the gaping vent .
That tell of the memories of long vanished days ;
From the street outside came a watchman 's call
The house stands , or it stood but yesterday .
I follow the trade for which i was made
And when she asked what turn the sickness took ,
On which the moonlight falls . now a dark cloud
In the same breath orlando turned anew ,
Who did the young man 's cares commend .
He called upon allah , and died a believer !
Or calm the troubled hour of death ?
For which i let slip all delight ,
" that gloomy race lead up the evening dance ,
Forward they come , with flaunting colours spread ,
We lose too soon , and only find delight
It comes to pass that what was body 's shadow
Marks coming and marks going ...
The right of rank as arranged by moses ,
To fit the statutes o ' poetry ,
The spirit of the hero spoke :
Profundities that held nor bar nor veil ;
And sink into a state of relaxation ,
Something went wrong . i saw him throw the hoe
All heaven descends , and opens bright around you !
And set above the world , -- the coming christ
And followed by all his bailiffs bold ,
First consul when the kings were thrust from rome .
Which the priests have spread over the world
Alone gives aid to city charged with sin .
Pitch of thick substance boiled in that low hell ,
There the south-west wind shall blow
From me some plume , that thy success may show
They met with plaintive sighs .
No peace , no rest , the elements bestow ,
Each wooded island shed so soft a green
And his dread thunders rattling in the sky .
All go to swell his love for me ,
Here pagan pride , with sceptre , stood ,
Now was the summons come she must obey ,
We know that fate dealt kindly with our dead ,
From the river rose a monster ,
B. trade it may help , society extend .
The sun had not yet scaled the eastern ridge :
And the sands roll from the hour-glass .
I am all that ever went with evening dress !
Rivers of rapture thrilled in sunny thaw ;
No more for him , where hills look down ,
No mortal word can frame ,
Down went the bridle-hand ,
To feel you tread it to dust and death --
His song brought love as april brings the bird ,
From mounts that show it more than dreams .
It 's coming yet for a ' that ,
Round the cape of a sudden came the sea ,
Each rock reflects a softer light ,
Which his , and countless of your warriors spend ,
What it would mean for you and me
The waters . i have kept faithful watch --
Her permutations can no truce sustain ;
Arthur , when the heart feels most ,
Twice was the youth of time renewed ,
How such a parting we must ever rue !
Shalt thou swift vengeance take
The crowd doth gather , in silence it rolls ;
The world still lies in the hand of god .
_ everyone reaps the fruit of his folly _
Stay my wrecked spirit within thy control ,
Yet not wrapped about with awful mystery ,
Who since the morning-hour set out from heaven
Father ! to thee my spirit cries !
The lecturer took his place and looked
On his strong heart the gifts that could accord
When howe victorious our weak armies chased ,
Have women nursed some dream since helen sailed
He hath raised up a certain lazarus ,
Must make the gamester 's losses good .
Erewhile thy obstinate heart might move .
Whence tyber first unlocks his mighty flood . "
And none more kindly gives and takes hard knocks .
Half-dressed , sir guy runs out ;
She gave thee beauty -- shaft of eyes ,
And ' neath its rays in sin persist .
Now give me a deed to prove my faith ;
The one his pleasures around him strews ,
The saddest birds a season find to sing ,
Our fathers laid freedom 's foundations here ,
But things removed that hidden in thee lie .
To try theology i feel inclined .
Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys ,
And stars like fireflies shed their light ,
Strains musical flowing through ages , now reaching hither ,
His wiles will break and spend themselves in vain .
The warring ranks concealed . thence did the chief
And its departure followed ,
The glory of mood where human frailty failed ,
Shall surely take hold on you ;
Or who takes note of every flower that dies ?
And leave us desolate and earth forlorn !
Upward rolling his lustrous eye , --
With heavenly grace his looks and visage shine ,
They died -- and the mother that gave them birth
Nor felt the heaven-wide jostling of the winds
The radiators lose their temperature :
What love saw done and undone .
He whom no praise can reach is aye
Than wrath , which groweth till its bitter fruit
Or match with destiny for beers .
But fainter , ever fainter grow their cries ,
And in the middle they take their place ,
Comes from the roughness in the primal germs ,
In flowery groves that ring with mirth --
And crackling oaths went to and fro
Still seeking happiness through perished grace
And fear only tells it in undertone .
For the treasure that lies in the quivering blue .
When man he makes a penitent for it .
In whom high god hath breathed a secret thing .
The fateful sands unfaltering ran ,
Can puff it out even quicker than it came .
And from out his dreams awakened ,
To give full ardour to the song combine ;
To pierce with beauty to the heart !
Gently , and without grief , the old shall glide
" an image of that calm life appears
Of a grief premature on their fair promise fell :
" of fifty chains the sultan gave
Delay not : ere the western sky is hung
That sealed from mortals lay .
In the loose earth rose the alders ,
Back to me thy footsteps trace !
And through those notes ran glib division ;
And send the tears into mine eyes --
Fifty years spent before i found me ,
Plucking stars to make his crown --
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes ,
But , turn 'd to embrace his laws ! --
Shattered and crashed down ruin over the world .
Clung round the struggling nymph , with piercing cries ,
" day by day , " the promise reads ;
Lost in their love of self .
May bring all kinds of evil on the house .
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish ,
And fill their little hearts with joy ,
And , laughing , pointed to the oblivious flood .
And in their hollow bark to pass the night ;
With oils and honey blazed the augmented fires ,
You go beyond your last .
Their doctrine could be held by no sane man .
And shook his slumber in a room
Appointed , which declares his dignity ,
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran ,
Twelve others followed -- costly loads they bore ,
Nor makes small mirth thereat ; because aware
The poised expectancy of love ;
O , shower the healing notes like rain ,
And with impatience like relation bore :
But that a happy love made blind his eyes
A thought which makes her reason so
Wherein i wait your coming as the twilight falls .
And having drunk , we raise a shout
To stem the golden flood that flows
And in a warrior each has found its mark ;
Amid such calm delight now slips away ,
By those brief words , accompanied with smiles ,
And sith went theyre way .
For sorrow walks before her ,
The registry and label rested safe ;
Put creation harshly out of tune .
Till the dread morning rent the temple 's veil ,
By shame alone shalt thou redeem thy shame . "
His neck and feet continual journey made .
That pressed the beach and hasty to depart
Love , though unloving all conceived by man --
Woe had been wrought by that pitiless preacher .
That follow the sun and his sheen ,
We yet may yield some service . union much
Thy waves descend from brahmá ’s sphere ,
Help me to find true happiness ,
But who , that saw their treasures swell ,
But broken things to grow them in .
That such a misfortune should give her such pain ;
Them only fit for lords or rakes .
How god 's river feeds the fountain
The fear and pain set close around your way ,
Plunged me anew into my former sin :
No love between these two was lost :
Who tread with jaded step the weary mill --
Time 's work eternity must fill .
These natural love maintained , habitual those .
Hands whose coarse sinews may fill you with fear
That smiled and danced in the warm sunshine ,
Calm at my feet expands the glassy plain ,
Nor harm can hold .
Thou drovest a mortal to insult a god ?
Tho sapped by hunger and disease ; tho crushed
To make the best of life .
And he who this song made for singing ,
Yet neither may possess the claim they lay .
Thy restless feet now can not go
The clock struck one ,
That hear the harsh hours clap sharp wings
We gave her bows and curtsies ,
Achilles hath no succor given to thee ,
Whom no man 's daring heart has gained .
She shook the world .
As moisture lend to every grief that grows ;
To seize the crucial moment of the war .
Nor scarce could feel the ground beneath her feet .
Driven by the east wind 's power ,
And gentle words that mother would give ,
With sudden joy the leaping heart o'erpowers ;
Then to the central court he pressed
The little girl did as her bible taught ,
Makes goodness natural . upon each limb
In silent haste the rescue party filed .
Authoritative of that elder , sprang
One little dream hangs luminous
This like thrust of dagger came ,
Then blast me thunderer in righteous ire ,
To make his fellow mourn ?
Silence has stirred not in the heather ;
With fancy 's pencil and give birth to things
Solid and stirring in flesh and bone , --
Darkling they lie till comes the clear daylight .
She is content to feel the passion burn
And the light with the dark he twined .
And thee we ask thy favours to renew ,
The neighbors fetched a doctor in :
Which makes its entry in unwonted way .
That warrior 's dust now lies .
Seemed sad with glad things gone .
Rendered , by whom the spouting pumps were plied .
The love and truth that guided ruth
And though men drew sweet waters of the sea ,
Together they followed the cattle home .
Her mouth is stretched to cry ,
But , you see , this is november ,
And sapphires tip its branching horns .
From the marshes filled with danger ,
Our past that we sing draws nearer ,
In what far kingdom do you go ,
For i fell asleep , and dreamt three hundred ,
Prospects to him of land and ocean bring .
What god can tell , what numbers can display ,
Foul waters too with spirits wash 'd ,
And that stands all awry .
His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke :
And loves and pleasures fan the rising fires . --
That stood in kingly courts of old --
The gods allow to hear the dangerous sound .
The lifeblood from its source he draws ,
His great valour how can it be counted ?
The waves lie still and gleaming ,
Hate of my sin , grounded on sinful loving :
Till to imperious fate they yield their life .
Good news from heaven the angels bring ,
Her nine-and-fifty years came back ;
Because my love is come to me .
In sin for ever lost from life ; this act
That carries no colours or crest ,
Few may remember , none may reveal it ,
That brought the heart loud to the generous mouth ,
The faith by saint patrick was planted and grew ,
To take its music are all eager-wide .
Oft i recall that golden time when thou ,
Half buried in the tresses which it grasps ;
And their love they gave to me .
To drop their moisture on the teeming earth .
Dark is the world where your light shined never ;
The seasons run their various course and bring
Along a stream that raced and ran
Farewell ! i give thee free leave to go .
That strikes whatever is not dust .
An orange tree well hung with fruit ,
To simple shepherds keeping watch by night . "
And sche tho made a contienance ,
Does agatha 's sad heart not sometimes say :
On earth together lay the lovers spread .
And all his wealth achilles bore away .
Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill .
His people 's cries have pierced the cloud ,
Sock it into -- to administer physical punishment .
The day to bid their promised walls arise .
Thus were they brought , and thus they placed were
" woe is me , my old life fated !
As make my very blood run cold .
To force strong souls along the giddy steep
In the life that lies behind me ;
Of discipline lay on him .
It were a sin to steal a kiss , "
Like to a moving vintage down they came ,
Bring floods of grief to whitehall stairs --
Alas ! i of the fortune made assay ,
The lonely light that samuel palmer engraved ,
And swell his music as it floats along .
And every new heart that grows ,
My thoughts have no place now to play ,
From a sweet instrument a sound that grew
Must wander thirty-fold for all the time
Men saw the moving sky . all beasts most fierce
Then caesar saw that tumult held the shore ,
Toss up their heads , and stretch their wings .
Then , nymphs , take vantage while ye may ;
Retinge the dusk and livid air with bloom ,
This lovely darkness rose and set ,
Parted , alas ! i carry from its source ,
That he on her would vengeance take ;
Huge sun-flowers drenched with light ,
The sky reddened and the smoke swayed ,
And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom ,
Had given a love that was thrown away .
And follow , burning to attack
But right or left as strikes the player goes ;
" who every race would recreant make .
No pow ' r to bend it . disappointment wrung
So that more living its plantations stand .
For a cloud hath fallen from the sky ,
And find it barred to all my ecstasy .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Makes my heart high and glad , so to embrace
With duteous love she gives ,
My heart goes back to wander there ,
Of charity , that makes us wish alone
With serpent errour wandering , found their way ,
When joy has fled your brow downcast ;
What he was bound for -- poor young lad !
Next takes farewell and wounded aldigier ;
Mixed with the faith that brought all gods to birth
He made the near future unfold to his fancy ,
That strew the sandy solitude ,
And gather to my selfe new breath awhile .
And the hoar-frost bring me sadness ,
But this gives tears to dry despair ,
Had pledged her word there was no danger
By this message great loss shall come about . "
I am a dream of the creator made visible ;
Grew glazed in death there came in them a gleam
It goes ;
And half my strength was gone .
A pent thought brings .
Where high in opinion he stood ,
Whose fragrance fills the earth .
It would not reach , singing the holy smile
The learn 'd reflect on what before they knew :
Their claws from tiger and from panther tear ,
To lay this harvest up , and hoard with haste
So freely gave consent
Or sunk at the core of the world
More than a thousand times assurance swore ,
Along its course well-laden ships shall steer .
He hopes gradasso shall his prize restore ;
And stirred the blood that ran in brutus ' veins
That we can take delight in tarrying . "
To this but short reply did charles make ,
May sink beneath this weight of years .
Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy :
Deep in the woody wilderness , and gave
Though the cab crawled it sped too fast .
The quiet august noon has come ;
The table cleared , a romping battle ,
No troubles can come their hearts to estrange .
I fear we 'll come to harm . "
And straight her bosom felt a mutual flame .
Enough for me : with joy i see
Of fellow men calls on them to declare
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder ;
My voice could over the ages reach ,
Her heart outsoared , but felt
The rest are forms , of empty ether made ;
But in her vales upgrows the tree
December will bring .
Kissing cold stones , the women shrink for drought .
Seeing the man too nearly , missed the god ,
That sprightly fire which courage bids him take ,
It answered : " thee as in my mortal frame
O dearly bought revenge , yet glorious !
Stood lost in wonderment , the eumenides ,
He sat upon the rocks that edged the shore ,
Ere death hath made it lone .
Of day had waned , and round that shaded plot
Screaming , and fainting , prostrate sought protection ,
To strike whole hosts with terror and dismay .
Nor boughs bring forth as once , which having left
Where the healing sleep will bring
Speaking shall go , and note the great patricians
Have made the victory thine ; else , twenty such
Could we but fill to harmony , and dwell
That can not hold the dust 's eternal part ;
O he gives to us his joy ,
He sighed , and cast his eyes below :
They , ere the world had held me long ,
I saw something different from capitulation .
And soon the bridal day came on .
O make in me those civil wars to cease ;
So that in others pity soon may rise ,
Give me words wherewith to woo ,
Smile with young joy , with new affection burn .
But cruel fate calls me away .
Money only makes us greedy ,
A wail comes o'er the ocean ,
With sweet content may move her :
Or life 's cold barren path before us lies ,
Sweet is the lore which nature brings ;
But to the homestead bears afar their milk ;
Do thou repeat each thing that passed ,
To my arms their charge convey ,
His writ he issued on the morrow .
And the messenger saw that his mission was sealed ,
Up they go , peak after peak ,
And come to its maturity in heaven !
Nor breath could stir the aspen 's hair ,
The story of spots mention 'd to his own ;
Youth laughing went with love away .
Drive to the devil , thou hellish pest !
Fear ye not the waves that roll ?
The king held talk with his chief in war .
And close at hand it lies .
Confess one comfort ever will arise .
As bubbles that swim on the beaker 's brim ,
The gentle trade was left to churls ,
And after that he took his leave .
To thy fair feet a winged vision came ,
To blow a blast of shattering power ,
Hermes against a thief invokes the law . "
True mirth resides not in the smiling skin :
They ’ll take to respectable trades !
And with the music that rejoices ,
And feel that all the charm is gone
And a great minster 's glory met our sight .
Or led his wits astray .
The noise of bells went sweeping by :
And for a time his grief forgot its depth ;
That calls the black deep down --
' eyes so black they draw one trembling near ,
And it gives us warmth for cold ;
Thoughts that can not be quelled or made to take
The floods break their prison ,
And again the wail comes fearfully loud .
Was driven ; nor on mid earth sank the clouds
To let him feel her there when some harsh word
Bushes toss in the lashing gale ,
The more i find their malice to increase .
Nor let the smallest vision of it slip ,
Where the white billows break with roaring breasts ,
Whither her footsteps go .
She plumed the warbling bird of love .
Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds .
The ever-silent snows were drifting ;
I shall break out in ecstasy of words !
Words that could make heaven 's rolling circles stand ,
It does not seem to miss a beat ;
Seriously the fabric stood .
That virtue always meets reward ,
A thousand times of him had made an end ;
And currants that stood on the shelf .
That winter 's remnant he so passed that feat
Of thy skilled hand his quivered store he gave :
Thoughts urge on thoughts in quick successive birth ,
That makes my poor old tears run even now !
Some cool reviving airs breathe on her face ,
Thither flies her heart to join her treasure ,
And that strange armament forthwith pursue ,
And the leaves fall sere and yellow ;
Take thy flight , o evil creature ,
With recollections time can not destroy ,
Then he spoke the words which follow :
It rises quickly to the shining air .
There hang more destinies .
Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced ;
Shall it sound : his dream is ended ,
The unbalanced lights like meteors play ;
That leads one more last human hope away ,
The stars and seasons that come after ,
The doubtful gift , for treachery designed ,
Unless thou couldst return to make amends ?
And the receipts which thence might flow ,
Cheeks and lips shall bear the stain
Soon hurries me back to despair .
It rent and tore the veil which served to hide
Its sacred summit , swept by autumn gales ,
There lives -- though time should cease to flow ,
When all the stars of heaven sang for joy .
My words against them all in listed plain . "
In silence let it swell the flood
Where parting is never -- nor sorrow can enter .
That made mankind her worshippers ;
And this our life , too , whirls away ,
A battle won for truth and right
To welcome down my cheek the rolling tear ?
When blows the wind and drives the sleet ,
And gods supernal from the bursting sky .
Love in a shower of blossoms came
No traces shall remain of tyranny ,
Came , and made deeper still the present gloom ,
For the average folly the world calls a sin ,
The tears that through her eyelids fell on me
Sick by a foul and fetid odor made
Of weeds that bloom , whose sultry perfumes rise
At last the separation came .
That makes one shiver .
Of words makes me hiccough !
Of blood-stained pharaoh left their trembling coast ;
And drew in her breath with a hissing sound :
I meet you with rebuke for the reproach
Which makes its entry in unwonted way .
Whose souls are never to the tempest given .
Here doth white spring white violets show ,
And the eyes forget the tears they have shed ,
Among her old timber , the hollow winds whistle ,
And my beacons burn exultant as an everlasting sign
To drive the cold winter away .
The deep grass moved and whispered
And with redoubled force his foe he press 'd .
For when the market sends in loads of food ,
His story to ruth ere the death shadows fell .
The prudent general turned it to a jest ,
" and feel they not compassion ? "
Those qualities upon which friendship lives .
It fill 'd with phantom beauty cold and bare ,
To which there went one narrow pass
Are chas 'd by certainty , and terror turn 'd
With awe kept sacred and religious pride .
My heart had found contentment in that year .
In which our love lies cold and dead ,
And longwied as it came .
Calm at his feet the wave crept murmuring ;
That thy returning , brings back life to me ?
Why fret and sweat and try to mend ?
The harp of erin lies .
And the blue sky of autumn laughs above .
The sweetest songs which his heart had sung .
So he sought and got discharge ,
His arms are laid upon the fertile plain ,
To a stone she might have given life !
And a new progeny descends from heaven . '
And held its passage through the panting heart :
The old rhymes rang in the sunlit mist
And honour , as long as waves shall break ,
It speaks to god of glory ,
When , all with torches flaring bright ,
That in the sunshine floats , beneath the blue ,
To yield the secret ?
And often in his kiss the memory came
Then give command the sacrifice to haste ,
" which in the valleys lie ? "
Which lead the seasons by ,
Freedom was firmly based , and we
Watching its shadow grown a mammoth size ,
The path and porch are swept of snow ,
Start into light , and make the lighter start ;
Till my life is filled with darkness ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Than history ever gave or genius wore !
All that her eyes could read in mine
A chaos of all cries ! making the space
And if my prayers shall bring the victory ,
Fear of silence made them strive
Now waving on the waves they lay ,
Far in a south land brought to bay ,
All my woes dissolve and vanish ,
He follow 'd so fondly his own revery ,
Whose cause is god . he feeds the secret fire
As the years went rolling onward ,
A wind arose and rushed upon the south ,
Whose glory reaches not beyond the grave ;
Blackened wreaths of smoke came rising
A stream of blood from out the shoulder drew .
Have spun these webs , in blended morning hues
What meant to ease the burdens of the land ,
There passed a mighty tempest o'er the city ,
Set thou a seal upon my lips
All my life shall be spent for thee ,
Each some magic song suggested .
That makes the lowest hate it , but a voice
The summer wind read with thee , and the bees
That covered all a multitude 's distress :
My body with bitterness has dropt
The blessed standard made to me reply ,
Which heaven has made for man to use ,
And thou art stricken to the dust .
And hidden thoughts shall open lie and bare . "
And pride in ruin lays .
In which life 's sordid being hath no part .
Voicing a sorrow we can ne'er express ,
The revelation of thy smile doth make
And backward to his city chase the foe . "
And make a shroud out of their suffering ,
This found i true by proof , hearing that spirit
And when her seraph 's eyes she caught ,
All in their nightgowns , snowdrops stand ,
The generations pass , the ages grow ,
Of broken troops , an easy conquest find .
The trees will bend more perfectly above you ,
No christmas ghost can make us chill ,
Cursing helps better -- cursing , that goes
The dew still clinging to their golden fleece ,
And sank to death and cowardice ?
Filled all who saw with terror ,
What though our faltering accents fail ,
Has fancy died ? the morning star gone cold ?
This life oppressed with woe and pain :
And leeches suck their blood .
Drawn down from heaven by the throes of rome ,
That my despairs had governed me too long .
The latest heat mixed with the earliest chill --
The minster-clock has just struck two ,
As it fell out upon a day ,
Be held in reverence and fear ;
Onward shall roll , ere yet the funeral pyre ,
A fool surcharged , propelled , unwarned ;
Dread found no place . where thousands share the guilt
And though the years may come and go
The gray dust gathered on the leaf unturned ,
To find a prayer their lord may hear :
What chance or fortune brought you to these shores :
You something of her tale may trace .
Like heavily lamenting from them went .
And the ivory flutes would lead them
Which , linking thee with all thy kind ,
He bears the unbroken blast from every side .
And when all of this life is gone , --
Till toward the centre set the starry tides ,
Caught into life , in fiery fumes they rise ,
A pure white spirit oftentimes is seen .
Wherefrom to reach the gentle fields of air .
I found in a moment had bitten my hand ;
A high brow set with starrs of gold ,
The flower that gives me nourishing ;
By the innocent blood he shed ,
He doth feel the sorrow too .
The secrets that there lie hid .
Or measureless be bound in narrow speech ,
My spirit , feeling that i was not whole :
A cedarn cradle holds thee ,
And silence sits and listens to the wind ,
Man to th ' alluring object gives his will .
His beating bosom claim ’d the rising fight .
This woman took her life ; if for ill health
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
When thee i from thy darksome dungeon drew ,
And to the fields his road would take ;
The morning 's snow is gone by night ,
My cheek sunk and sallow ;
Till i saw these days of sorrow ,
Here counted o'er the heaps acquired with pain ;
Should they , by ruin to reflection led ,
Of lagging war he kept his courage true .
My fever was quite gone .
A nobler glory now attempts to seek .
The pilgrim listens , as the night air brings
The happy , happy day , and thrilled and glowed
Shout ! let it reach the startled huns !
The sovereign power possessed no less than will ,
And in words like these expressed him :
And to the land and ocean give the law .
And to her faith commit the trojan race ?
It asks no wreath the arm can win ;
And slowly rising , thus the council moved .
Renewed in rapture in the reddening air .
Clouds curl and curdle blue and grey
Alone gives aid to city charged with sin .
The blue haze-cradled mountains spread away ,
The west-wind finds its way :
To the nightmares , as they go :
For the gods give the secret of beauty
To tread the humble paths of earth .
Away over heaven the young heart flew ,
Immortal song on victor 's deeds attended .
She shared with us the tears her conflict brought ,
Where the last fires of sunset burned . _
And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away .
When times succeeding see her efforts fail !
I stand a pagan in the holy place ;
And grappling hands each seizes on his foe ;
For why should souls immortal , made for bliss ,
Above the bursting fires , and rolling smoke ,
The veil was from my eyesight drawn --
Verona he doth for the indies take ,
What time the greeks combined their social arms ,
And silent falls the wintry rain .
Warreth with arrows , shrinking from the fray .
What i relate are only simple facts .
The hands of holy promise , finds a throng
Here , spreads a green expanse of plains ,
He is gone , and silence takes me unaware .
Their smiles but sorrow to my heart convey ;
This made him cry with rage and spite :
Beyond compare the son of god was seen
Will make the red blood to flee
Yes , though when freedom had her temple won
Who pours from his great throat the roaring bass ,
For vengeance follows fast and will not spare ,
The lure of freedom drew ;
Than the heart says , with floods of tears ,
When they together short discourse had held ,
Take then awhile thy turnus ; let him fly
His thundering ships no more our coasts assail ,
To pay their vows to thee ,
Had absorbed the disease of woe .
He saw mischief was brewin ;
The senator stood in agreeable embarrassment .
Opening their various colours , and made gay
That 's now speaking to thee . '
Waving and tossing in sweet summer air ,
Nor is there any joy to match with mine ,
Love , give me back my heart again .
Treads you , save as dreams allow .
Lament and noise of smitten hands arise ;
Life and death he drew as circles ,
But the green sickness was eating his slender body .
And life seemed moving on to happy ends .
But he made no answer to what i said .
Oft to their hearts it sends an icy chill ;
The broad stream bore her far away ,
And hide his shameful fact with mine offence ,
Meanwhile the youth , directed by his god ,
Time , only , makes the banish 'd man .
Of lofty saints these words addressed .
And her joy so early flown .
Until his life was almost gone .
Trust in god and calm their fears .
Where destiny with men for pieces plays :
Greetings bring to those that greet you ,
Traced by the sailing moon .
Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood .
The tyrant gave , then parted thence ,
All human courage gives , or takes away .
When the long ranks go to pieces in the
If scenes of misery can entertain ,
Oft did he mark the scenes of vanished war ,
Clothed him with life again , and lifted --
His rule to jackalls is transferred .
Some twenty times he made the russ retire ,
His right hand brandishing a glittering spear .
The servant , who hath joyful tidings brought ,
" not all the mysteries that in us lie --
And springs ran nectar , honey dropped from trees .
How yet the regal aspect he retains !
At length my ariel lays his viol by ;
May find that golden maidens dance through thee .
Where i passed through every peril known
Thy rest and ease secured be .
He hardly dares to draw his breath .
Pure love , who scarce his passion tells ;
The night descends with sleep and coolness ,
To whom our saviour answer thus returned : --
Lit by the devilish , dancing light .
The sun rose dimly thro ' the pallid rain ,
To gather fortitude from pain ,
Be turned to energy in doing good ?
Could he who taught each planet where to roll ,
Shall gore be made to flow ?
He put by woman chances that arose
And from her heart the new world 's rapture drove
Columbia 's sons , to extend the fame
Till christ at the end relieve our guard .
The muses raised , and how its spell enthralled
God 's blessing must be resting on the fruit --
Thy people fathom life , and find it dire ;
The promises he made , when once we met
And on their heads the crime to cast .
What voice of joy finds listeners in the sky ?
And birds sing sweetly in branches that arch an alley
But no caress came back again ,
In the long years coming after
The harvest breezes swell ,
Upon her wings presents the god unshorn .
Are calling thee to die !
Good father , the rebellious flesh , i see ,
These tidings carry to the anointed king ;
Also , who laid the rainbow 's piers ,
Bring sad thoughts to the mind .
Which evermore makes all things new !
Youth went by and health went by
And fix your claws in nicol 's heart ,
And watch , reposed in summer sloth ,
And to his cell in anger turned .
Levied a kindly tax upon themselves ,
To catch a loathly plume fallen from the wing
And soon one broke out : ' i can suffer
And the match , released by the sudden shock ,
As autumns came an ' winters went
And feeble cast by a rude hand among us .
With that perfume came a vision ,
Far away his growing fame
We fell out , my wife and i ,
The little index , pointing , told us where ;
The clouds hang over it , heavy and gray ,
And those we most love find a happiness rare ;
Bereft of the pleasures that once it has borne .
Lovely with laughter and suffused with light ,
And can i then descend to be a traitor !
Scarce could my bounding heart its joy contain .
Their efforts now prevail ;
Then those that did not blink the terror , saw
That sense feels more than what doth sense contain ?
With lively hope his soul expanding ,
Drawn by the magic of the monarch 's fame ,
That comes from spirit , from the plato rapture ,
The sun just touched the morning ;
And shadowed and thrilled with alarm ,
And fast as they thus take their flight ,
Now freedom appears from the world to have flown ,
But feels he soon could lay him low ,
The dewberry dipped for to work delay ,
When the deceit wrought on him is betrayed ,
But keep your fancy free . "
The lonely lilies rise ;
No treachery lingered to poison
Evening came on ; the glowing clouds
Last earthly prayer with which to thee i cling --
The pictures come , the pictures go ,
To all promiscuous , as they pass ; _
His form assumed , apollo thus began .
Misfortunes serve to make us wise :
Except of sighs , that made th ' eternal air
So from his lips the crime returned
Round the first kindred soul it meets .
Lights pale october on his way ,
And cheerful horns from side to side resound ,
The hand that reared them from the neighboring grave .
For darkness now was creeping o'er the earth :
And gave him the neuralgee .
The presence of the flame they mark ,
Forecast , but it must needs to issue come ?
Of the stars tells day is past .
Points of death , bid love be gone ; --
Of elegance as yet he took no care ;
I feel no heat in all thy fire :
And joy in every bosom woke :
And backed by the reflected blue .
I think i should have made a decent spouse ,
The few whom hastings ' field of carnage spared ,
Because he had brought it so near to perfection .
And blown with restless violence about
Shine life-giving with thy light ,
Where england 's king in leaguer lay ,
Two armies stand enrolled beneath
And silence must resume her power ;
Whom we must follow , but may not recall .
A messenger last night arrived the tidings bore .
Sounder opinion none can hold than this ,
By velvet waters making soft music as they surge
Might other motion o'er it run ,
She gave him a look of pity ,
Looms the great life that is to be ,
But nothing could her perish 'd sight restore :
Amid the fairest things that grow
When that strange flame went up the mountain side ,
The years have come and gone , --
She 'd found a blessed happiness ,
By instinct to what use to put his powers .
At fairest worth still point their deadly rays .
She sees the joy , but feels it not :
Has driven me to rest -- and i can bear
The birds were building , the woods were green ;
Until the broken heavens streamed apart ,
With steps made swift by anxious thought
From around balder , all the heroes went ;
Truths that wake to perish never , 277 .
To throw full day on darkest scenes of time ;
Before that splendid outrage failed and fell .
No passage whence the count might air receive .
To freedom 's duty giving ,
And the swallows will bring the spring ,
To mourn with him , and show him care .
So he , whose mischievous advice prevailed .
If he had in affliction sought the lord ,
On whom your rhyming ridicule is spent ? "
And in twain he broke the aspen ,
And anger and shame arose ,
Youth passes , unredeemed they lie ;
With ripening cornfields waving wide .
Snowflakes became a world ; and , taking life
And of their doings god takes no account .
There from whence envy first did let her loose .
And will wrought a ' the sorrow .
And froze the genial current of the soul .
Te say , hoo far this mischief may extend .
His knowledge of good lost , and evil got ,
Others thought it cried , " repent ,
The routed nightmare let the sleeper wake .
Which a sister presents to unprejudiced eyes .
Returning came his years as wholly vain --
Their teas and plied their healing arts ;
They track 'd them on , nor ever lost ;
Our years -- and age comes on .
Surely peace comes . as sure as man
And they sang the words which follow :
Flowed dark words blending with sombre stream : --
Thou sever not ; trial will come unsought .
Yet constant ever to its source . it greets
In foreign countries , others seek renown ;
Thou sleepest , rocked in lonely misery !
The parent mount with richer glory fills ,
One long rapidity of roaring light ,
That words of wedded lovers must bring good .
Into burning fury fanned :
Yonder hill that frets the sky
Whose lot is set apart for heavenly birth .
The word i gave you i 'll fulfil ;
So fair the legend told ,
Ravished and trembling with ecstacy ,
Who would to love make no replies ,
Answered in the words which follow :
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
Its cooling shade shall throw :
There , mid the symbols that proclaim thy crimes ,
Comes like a wind and passes like a fire .
But of our being in it gave full faith
Drawn by the unctuous snail 's slow pace ,
Here comes life 's pageant by ! "
Fame of my fate made various sound ,
With looks of smother 'd indignation eyed her ,
Thus strove a being . beauty fain ,
But still he slept and took his rest .
Or rattling coach that passes .
The soul that inly yearns for love ,
In his own verse the poet still we find ,
Nor less the alarm that shook the world below ,
Lands where earlier suns arise ?
To _ heaven _ , and because it lies
Fame of dorinda 's conquest brought
Misrule followed misrule , and justice fled .
Despairing agony , his mouth pours forth
Nor fancy prompted , nor experience drew ,
But she to better thought her heart had shut ,
" but thee again the breath of tempest found ,
And felt a cool wind go like grace
Another , with her maidens , drawing off
There where the bright path led .
Faintly came her milking song --
Then there came a day
You seize the flower , its bloom is shed ;
Were the sociable hours he used to pass ,
But when judah 's harp shall raise
That leads vain men amiss and makes them stray ;
What chiefs the danaï can furnish forth
And spur me to the top . '
And whistled with an air of idle ease ,
The breath of life to warm the slain ;
Than mere compassion ever waked before ;
Resplendence everywhere the eye discovers ,
But left no stain upon those souls of thine
Still o'er them floated an inspiring breath --
The tortures set for tantalus himself
It stands so lonely in the sky
The music beauty from it draws .
How lightly his footsteps fall .
The dear , familiar phantoms rise again ,
To sit till leave was beckoned . ]
Sigh for the prophet 's paradise to come ; "
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
Who , in reviving reason 's lucid hours ,
My soul can reach , when feeling out of sight
Were as the rock that spread beneath and pierced ;
And all the years had vanished ,
A serpent bearing in his pounces clutch 'd
And makes himself a way through mantuan plains --
Ye caterers for the public , hence take heed
This said religion was a friar ,
Of pleasure through my life would go !
That broke in words of pain
He , greatly strengthen 'd by the voice divine ,
Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain 'd .
And meet the worst his fears foreshow ?
As from black clouds the floods descend
And fettered thousands bore the yoke of war ,
Death in their prison reaches them ,
In his strong hand your fears and sorrows lie .
The ebb it drew them fro ;
From what once lovely lip it springs unseen !
Whence it sprang as seed from the godhead !
The moon rose up like a globe of gold
And left earth wondering ; and star by star
Chill as a dull face frowning on a song .
One lingering look behind i cast ;
Which made the hearts of the dauntless faint :
He felt a sort of twinkling in his eyes ;
Freeing the spirit , till with joyous wings
Instruct a monarch where his error lies ;
Thy life-blood tracks its parent lake ,
And women chaste , these are the things which lift
And fresh-blown roses wash 'd in dew
Was lit with primroses , that lay atop
My power was felt and recognized -- but stay ,
To give the island a complete survey .
" on first looking into chapman 's homer . "
That turns a mockery and a jest ?
Bring their tribes to fell destruction .
So long as aces take the king ,
Lost in the dreaming alchemies of tone ,
And the galleys that steered for the strand .
Where all the roses breathed one word ,
If that host get him in purgatory ,
Of all that it contains . the following heaven ,
Of flashing wit suspended o'er your head ,
But their hearts felt the god 's power : suddenly
These stately forms , that bending even now
Her warmth and splendor wasted . never girl
Of mad delight they drop their spoils , and bound
Than images only , flashed through nerves and brain
Love , that hears thy death-bell toll
And its high towers stretch up and up .
The vexing ghost awhile i lay .
Was but the mask to cover your deceit ;
I feel , this moment , a mighty yearning
Thy brother ’s death thou fain wouldst see .
My fearless strength will still prevail .
Alas , that a vision so happy should fade !
And dreadful precincts passing , ghostly fields
In starry bloom extend ,
Then turned he on the foe , hurling swift doom
That broke the very trees around ,
Hearts bruised with loss and eaten through with shame
Some future state revealed to us by zeus ,
Take either part , sure ills attend the choice ;
With them came thirty ships in order due .
The things whereof the wizard 's spirit told .
Writhed not at passed joy ?
And left me to despair . the pain of mind
A doom from which no human king could rise .
Brave thoughts still lodge beneath a furrowed brow ,
More wealth than miser 's dreams could show ,
Who knows what changeful fortune may produce ?
When thy ships brought upon their sailing wings
With its tears we 'll chase away our own .
Glitters the dew , and shines the river ,
Its strong walls blending with the common clay ,
To keep my love unuttered and to stand
That shadows a heart that has wandered
And his soul leapt forth in prayer .
All he unfolds ; his listening spouse turns pale
No least cloud hovered in her azure sky ;
Leaving a nameless sense that lingers
When cromwell spake the word democracy !
As wonderingly our looks its course pursue .
What softened remembrances come o'er the heart ,
And from the silent waters , as they flow ,
And feel a glow of holy gratitude ,
' fore it comes ten o'clock ternight . "
A weeping thirst by hot winds ever fanned .
The putrid water felt its powerful aid ;
With filmy mantle falling musical ,
Where shelter warm i found from the rude blast ,
Of rushing waters , as they leap
So through the city 's open gate streamed in
His peaceful moments ran ;
Moves and directs thee ; then no flattery needs .
Force my way with courage , rushing
And gives courage to the wanderer .
The laws by which the thunderer bears sway ,
The wise sumantra , thus addressed ,
" your tears put it out ;
But the years that mock me will not say
And all the thoughts she planted in my heart ,
At which all modern nations vainly aim ;
And gather 'd perfumes here and there ;
Had lost the life of may 's ;
Upon her cheek the colour went and came
The world ofttimes converted into chaos ;
The mysteries in which this life is hearsed ;
May find their heaven again ) ,
Her fire has filled the earth .
With its brotherhood fell it steals !
Silent would no longer stand :
And faith that to life 's problem she could find
Our rivals had launched at our city for years .
Manu , who life to mortals gave ,
Art as a voice that calls across the night
They laid in bed till the clock struck ten ;
Love doth make the heavens to move ,
So shall the northern pioneer go joyful on his
He gave us all a good-bye cheerily
Now pale disease shoots thro ' my languid frame ,
Naught will you find but sorrow and sin ;
Which goes to show that old nature 's plans
And through our blood there runs
That sits within her eye ,
Ah , when the summer comes again
It trembles into death , but comes anon ,
So went the moonlight hours along ,
How the town buzzed that newton had gone mad .
Grist grabbed the fiend 's throat ,
And make his sorrows light ?
Answer will not come to prayer --
My business endeavors would all come to naught ;
Which goes to show that old nature 's plans
Nor fear a second death should cross his love .
Sir pig , i see , comes prancing in
This awful summons came : -
As it swells and sobs
All troy is tumbling from her topmost spire .
Through marching scores of winters racked she lay ,
Death gives us more than was in eden lost .
The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray ;
When death shall take thee from her side ,
The market place in silence lay .
And ance it fell upon a day
Sucks from its waters more than air can hold
And when the hour of sleep its quiet brings ,
And out of stricken helmets sprang the fire .
Till i have driven such folly from his head ;
And with my satire take no aim ,
Makes one in love even with its very faults .
Her tell the tale that moves to pity ,
The bugle 's gone for smoke and play ;
Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life ,
Before the winds how the clouds flee :
For bashfull merit only dwells
The head upon her pillow , touched with love ,
As storms the riven pine to music stir .
Fresher shall the living grow .
You bind my freedom from its rightful quest .
No help his life could save ;
Have seen what strength in war is thine ,
Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure .
E'en while their footsteps press the clay ,
Such as their fortune promised , gazed the foe .
Into new loves the eternal love unfolded .
It falls for one who can not weep ;
She gave him audience in that glimmering room
To melt a heart that with resentment glowed ,
Give him the final bliss . that was the proof
To lend me aid and set me free :
The wan despair that words can never speak .
That it should not find destruction .
But now , when reason has assumed her throne ,
And made her poor old bones to ache ,
His eyelids flew back for the bliss --
To shrinking realms announced her fatal fall ;
Shall miss the haunts of paradise ,
His piping feeds the starved and warms the cold ,
In stressful hours it falls and hovers ,
What was the event ? let tragic story tell
What love sustained when she was most alone ?
Stanley gives the title inaccurately .
We make delay , that somewhat first the sense ,
There solitude , that still to dullness tends ,
To add to-day the final touch of life
Confusion in their looks they showed ,
That makes bold , if fear daunts any ,
The tranquil image in its eyes , and knows
Where then , ah ! where shall poverty reside ,
He made his feast on lions slain in chase :
Death came and made my worshipped one his prize ;
Still the rains in floods descended .
Full in sight ran on before him ,
The visions vanish , and the glooms remain .
The curtain fell on poverty and age .
But he lovingly put in his biggest licks ,
Within his bending sickle 's compass come ;
And the night has come , and planets glinted ,
As made my childish days rejoice !
Which ask herculean strength to break !
In that good world to which they led ;
The snow that makes one blind ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Sometimes a settler viewed him with suspicion ,
To weary muscles strained with toil ,
For sin and stain were banished thence ,
Of thing that was tofore passed ,
So i ran for the legislature and was elected .
Fair be the garden where their loves may dwell ,
For him as kindly spread the flowery lawn :
Which tremble made the pagan knights and lords .
The spring that ebbs and comes again ,
In the fire laid steel and iron ,
Where implex aisles lead to gyte doom ,
Which flamed round his forehead and clouded his sight ,
The universe unfolds ; all properties
( an angel in whose likeness he could trace ,
He passed away , and now forever stands
That passed , the sun began to rise ,
Free as the will of him who freedom willed ,
I live for ever , let the rest all lie
She shines on thieves on the garden wall ,
Radiant palace -- reared its head .
Until his very steps have left a trace
Sought to find his cause for sorrow :
The worth that virtue can bestow .
And of his faults made mention .
That on the summer morning lay for long ,
The peace of conscience also dwels
Love , give me back my heart again .
Blown up his nose to help the ailing eye .
Nor give thee any love -- which were unjust .
The rose-winged hours that flutter in the van
And very near to victory could bring .
There march the heroic bands that bring defeat ,
And o'er the stile went singing .
That never handled weapon a more redoubted knight .
Will i stand up and meet my death alone .
And swung through the cycle of life !
And one of them , who felt himself annoyed
It scoffs at dangers , tho they lurk around ,
It springs abrupt from that sharp point in time
" all that day raged the war they waged ,
I had matched pride with love -- and lost !
The angelic hosts before him bend :
But his suggestions met " god will provide . "
Behold him now his genuine colours wear ,
Where devils glean .
And let a pitying thought possess thee then ,
To take what comes of good or ill
Doth from the vision , that reflects the scene .
On some rock the wild wave wraps ,
The morning breeze blew cool and free ,
Her swelling grain that goes
Pride sneered at poverty -- if poor of purse ,
His stature reach ’d the sky . "
Follow low-whimpering , pining for their lord
“ think not that any suffering it can feel .
Him paris follow ’d to the dire alarms ;
The grape receives a fatal wound .
Which made me no less eager to turn round ;
And holds his planets true :
I follow 'd thee , as mortals in a chase
Of ivy , bringing that which numbs .
One day , while still these waters run ,
And the black-robe chief made answer ,
To trace the source whence the fierce contest grew ;
Comes mirrored to me as infinite ill .
The same rich light hung o'er her cheek ,
First heaven must needs so long revolve me round
And then there met his view
So drawn aloft , athwart the column tied ,
Then feed on thoughts , that voluntarie move
And the hammer beat thee sorely .
I 'd have piled my pyre on high ,
Where grief ca n't reach you more !
Waving the hope of eternity bright .
And a clambering vine in the gay sunshine ,
Other eyes might beam as bright ,
Black and low the storm clouds gathered ,
( retaining still the brook to bear us on )
Their lives unto her ; shaping sure and strong
Nor brought the groans of plunder 'd nations here ?
A man whom fortune made to fashion known ;
Each some magic song suggested .
The holy church expects of thee no less ! "
Then making bold to go within , she heard
It never through my mind had passed
To thrive , would interpose some little ease .
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art ,
Hacks us thus cruelly , slivering again
That cast its light a thousand miles and more .
My heart and life and soul to fill .
And clearing his throat made the following speech : --
To deepen by restraint , and by prevention
My heart came back again :
And poured his heart out like the rending sea
Has a tear drop of gratitude ready to fall !
A tear stood in his bright blue eye ,
To bear _ thy _ messages to man ;
Virtue , which christian motives best inspire !
So still the night falls ,
Each one the holy vault doth hold --
Make an end of thy deception ,
Then he spoke the words which follow :
All doubts gave way , all retrospective lore ,
But soon that passing dream was gone ;
Together ; from his spine the marrow sprang ,
He found the mark his knife made there ,
Nor call sad thoughts of parted friends to mind ;
That sullen clouds were gathering in the skies
Whose grasp a passing shade can hold . ”
My friend and i at last fixed on a day
Thy own endymion lay reclining ,
That since i looked upon such potencies
Thus did some moons of bliss go by --
Them quick resentment stung , but him the most ,
And through it rang one shriek of pain ...
We have kept the longing warm within .
When he can settle an account ,
With the affright that from her aspect came ,
Which anaxagoras takes unto himself ,
Had brought the tidings , that without the walls
To make the nuptial preparations . then ,
It made me lonely and it made me sad
Of bursting buds and flowers that come in may .
What delight or hope remains ?
Along the path , which through a forest lay ,
To theirs hath been as fondly laid ;
Forever deserts the veins , and leaves the bones .
Which saves its surface from the mould of death .
As nature intends . lastly , with any grain ,
Before his hour to death had fled ,
And vexing sprites that choke the upward swell .
To make divine the human heart 's desire .
And by the breath of mercy made to roll
Will fill the night with prayer .
Their torches that raise soft desire ;
Could lean upon his strength .
Where first i own 'd that virgin-love
Of most erected spirits , most tempered pure
And time , when one is riding , flies ;
With that sunshine , when cloudy looks are cleared .
Whose race shall bear aloft the latian name ,
Since i went forth god to obey ,
To things unseen , and make all mystery clearer .
The sword has rescued what the ploughshare won !
Thank you , pretty cow , that made
Come wealth or want , come good or ill ,
That showed the righteous suffering still
Where all the heavenly arms and weapons lies :
It came -- attended with the false sublime ,
At once there rose a noise and din
That whatever storms descend
Until the flow ' ry snare
Such joy they found , as forests feel
Thy loving hands will set
To transact all that trickery business behind .
Since each suggests opposite topics for song ,
For lo ! the ides of april come !
Let us your crowns and treasures see . "
Which many a love hath set behinde ,
Together two found shelter , " did she say ;
Which others often show for pride ,
How it gushes and struggles out
The heedless world hath never lost .
Them tunes he larned down martin fen
Of the warm rivers winding to the shore ,
The air is charged with amatory numbers --
In every land ulysses finds a foe :
Death in the living waters , and withdrawn ,
And labour 'd forms , to higher matters fly ;
Nay , if no triumph is reserved for me ,
Anguish and grief there find a blest retreat ;
" as the gay spirits rose -- at last ,
Sad hearts would bound and smile
Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail ,
Told stories to make his host merry : --
To make us subject to a jurisdiction ,
Each some magic song suggested .
Then strove to go . should love not spare ?
When the great summons came he rushed to arms ,
Their accents did resound .
The gusts that past a darkening shore do beat ;
And still as the dark began to fall ,
The spear , with all his fury flung ,
Where the immortal sorrows might find a home .
His round shield was with fire winged for slaughter .
To build the lofty purpose of his soul .
Fresh voices make a sweet refrain ,
What noble progress have we made !
With nap if russia went to war ,
To days when thoughtless childhood ruled o'er all .
Let those who pant for wealth or fame
Through the pines on the summit where they blow ,
The vital flame , and swells the genial seeds .
And the village thought me a fool .
Along whose verge our spirits stray , --
That england has made .
And lust of war his soul shall feed ;
With dying light the sun to rest had sped ,
For ah ! there comes a fear ,
All but the fool who sought his destiny .
To gain an indian village near the lake .
The perils and pains that pressed ,
Life 's troubles come never too late !
I ask ( and fates no answer give ) ,
With that small stock thy bounty gave or lent .
I mean if sweet prudence the subject maintain ;
The powers that in the enchanted horn reside .
No vapour rested on the mountain ’s head ,
Once , when midnight smote the air ,
Soft she lies in gold and brown ,
Then to the neighboring forest led the way .
So i in my sorrow must lie alone ,
So he deals it , age by age .
Time can not cool or smother
Nothing went right . at last , at last
But they who real goodness make their care ,
All the winds made dalliance
Long ago ! wind stirs the young grasses ;
Already you share in the greatness of god .
But we have felt enough to wish the peace :
Were never told can form and sense bestow ;
That lost the holy grail . "
The careless spirit too long restrained ;
But when the dawn reveals the rosy east ,
The finer arts there ripen in the sun .
There hung such hate upon that word ,
And priests like him who newport 's market trod ,
Where to leave sin 's awful load .
And flat the heavy drawbridge lay .
Both ladies now had fallen into grievous wrath .
And love for hill and wood he felt .
How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed ;
Their heavenly voices raised ,
Where last year they lay .
One was not left the tidings to declare .
Upon its pure unfolding sunshine steals ,
To fill thy air and sparkle o'er thee .
And in their northern cave the storms hath bound ;
With fury and blood , drove thee away . --
Over quenched sunset , circled round with flame ,
Who takes the fatal odds in fight ,
Of belial , flown with insolence and wine .
That makes youth beautiful . the lark is up
Whose iron clasp he always felt ,
Up from the flood where the faint stars play ,
Drive away all hope and courage .
His ancient realms ulysses shall survey ,
He kept his eye upon his chiefs
And base expedients , move to noble ends ;
For beauty born of beauty -- that remains .
Went to lead the herds to pasture ,
Thus our youth 's sweet moments glide .
It stretches silent as the tomb ,
Each drooping spirit with bold words repair ,
It is chill to rise with the morning star ,
Wine will fill our hearts with cheer .
Its steadfast light the beacon gave !
And his wishes served to guide him ;
The jealous love the cure had wrought ,
What wrong repressed , what right maintained ,
Save me the flame that mounteth ever higher !
Others bring the abbot before robin . _ ]
Can point the brimful grief-worn eyes
Man is restored to nature 's noblest place .
Which never yet saw navigate its waters
Our eyes went upward to the summit of it ,
Are equals , and the lowest slave that breathes
Which in her prescience she controlled still ,
Shall mingled be , to give the fatal blow
That bids the poor soul go .
Now rang the sound of wailing high ,
And show a kindly word to all
" was broken there to give them light ,
How merrily it goes !
You who would ever strive to pierce beyond
" and things that have grown sad are wicked ,
That made it fairer than the skies ,
Which works in storm and calm the eternal will ,
That went to make another day .
Their cues cut short , their occupation gone !
Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal ,
It is folly to fight with the infinite ,
A voice falls from another sky ;
That with their weight they make the balances
Or added powers or blessings -- how at last ,
His faith was tried and proved commensurate
Through woodlands dim have i taken my way ;
Our willing arms shall take the place
And then he fell to fill in blanks ,
What love could ne'er be brought unto .
And his old sire his helpless hand extend .
A youth , whose look told in a trice
That you still are standing true ,
Satan his fiends and spirits assembleth all ,
Wrapped in musing stands the sprite :
How authors find their colours here and there ,
To escape the weary stress of woeful war .
Then love thus crowned with sweet reward ,
Approach the foe , and meet the coming fight .
She springs into his glad embrace .
That they should draw to heaven his downward eye :
That only serves to make us grieve
As far as eye could stretch or see
And all who hear it turn to thee ,
The lords might think their dignity diminished by improper
And gently made their sad replies :
There hath been something for true freedom wrought ,
Swift through the town the warrior bends his way .
Down fell the ponderous image , crushing in its fall
And everlasting shades his eyes surround .
And in thy joyous errand reach the spot
Him his ill star and cruel fate conveyed
Your song thrilled on the air ,
Then shared the tyranny , then lent it aid ,
In a few hours the joyful tidings flew .
The good gray falcon made his master cheer .
When joy in my bosom was breathing its lay ;
Go ask the oracles . no mystic words ,
I find my shakespeare in his clown ,
When manhood 's clarion seemed to call --
And sober suns must set at five o'clock .
I feel only , she is here ,
The mossy carpet nature 's hands extend ?
Their eyes , which earlier were but moistened , sent
Or raise his horrid jaws , which this extends .
Which sought in all philosophy to find )
Where all my hopes had found a sudden grave .
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee ,
That none take armor for their queen 's defence .
Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners ,
Shall question , ere its judgment shall be read ,
All centuries blend when heart speaks out to heart .
The joy those happy hours gave too ,
An ' pa says when his grunt went off
Shrink from this first wild horror of the dark ,
Sweet stream , that winds through yonder glade ,
Poeonian led from amydon , and from
Nor let the shackles make thee sad ;
Yet silence came upon material things --
As they of what our folly says of us ;
As any the lips of the first gave before !
As two grim lions bear across the lawn ,
It mocks the power of remedies applied ;
From sparkling eaves when all the storm has fled ,
But not the life that lives undyingly .
That darkness once again , and win new worlds .
Will flicker in the newly opened leaves ,
Filled them with a sense of fear ,
Undaunted by an epithet , may find ;
Sees all her past rising up to confront her --
Where stands that village church , traditions hold ,
God gave you your life to use for him ,
Of clytius the illustrious gifts convey 'd .
To where his sacred relics lie ,
The shadow of the white boughs travels over your
Her voice made rich the summer air ,
And the great saint , the shock could bear .
Lest they should break the compact they had made .
Those womanly , caressing looks which fill
Which it assumed of some stubborn ground
Scarce could keep his temper under .
At ilium , but that glory might redound
But there came no other answer
With lighter probe or deep , touching the faith ,
" whence the life he gave unto it ?
The petty streams that pay a daily debt
Across this tireless , surging , tossing sea !
Kept time beside him , giving life a grace ;
The book each day some sorrow must unfold !
My spirit stirred with impulse from on high ,
The mighty soul how small a body holds .
To that soft appeal replied ,
Than all the mark of adam may redress .
That they passed from us as a worthless thing ,
That my pulses high may beat .
To keep his heart from breaking ,
Beat back the dread , beat down the woe ,
Him whose warm smile a life had well repaid ,
They 're borne , and neighbouring constellations made ,
To live in groans , and yield their parting breath
Far over earth , and air arise around .
Have you had a kindness shown , 58 .
The fleeting loveliness -- now seen , now lost ,
Trodden in vain till he regain the path .
Which , like the plants that throw
And loud rejoicing held the feast
Seven-headed monsters only made to kill
The root is dead and gone , my love ,
Might not be laid the church within .
But after the cake there came an ache ,
The son observant not a moment stays ;
And the kind , simple country shines revealed
Still as an island stood our ship ,
That wise advice rejected with disdain ,
Therefore make haste and come along with me ,
The realm of france he searches through ,
To make my soul a home .
By fame been raised .
Sometimes the linnet piped his song :
Of the forest loses all his waving leaves ,
But up arose the martial chuck ,
Bowed down in speechless grief like thine .
Which sages in the scriptures find ,
And found it sweeter than his honied bees ,
't is passing strange , those titled noblemen
Yet his memory will live while the poets sing ;
The angel cometh and the waters move ,
Past the entanglement where hopes lay strewn ;
To lead his legions . and the storm which closed
At court , lilies that toil not neither spin ,
And trust to coming years .
Of the burning eyeballs went to my brain .
Was traced a line of lightning .
What ruins kingdoms , and lays cities flat ;
Sixty-three , went john k. faulkner ,
The holy hermit poured his prayer ;
And follow still where fortune leads the way ;
Nor would she assume he lacked that unseen friend
Till this the wicked woman chanced to hear ,
And through the glades thy pastime take --
And opens all the mysteries of his make .
Where deep the shadows lie ,
Warm blew the breeze to land ; she lean 'd
Of autumn , which now hung o'er all
And troubled with religious doubt ,
Marvelous darkness shadow 'd o'er the place .
I wear the busy hours away .
Shall bear the kingdom ’s name no more :
Nay , and of hearts which follow other gods
He felt the storm of passion , far away ,
The hope to meet when life is past ,
Fear in kaikeyí ’s breast awoke .
Let it pass . i did not know
' time to put off the world and go somewhere
" rejoice this day that brings your prey ,
In royal chains a nation freed --
Between two mountains sank the sun —
The haughty swank holds sway --
And heather , where his footsteps pass ,
To a fair end no homely task have brought ,
Whose joy is mixed with pain
Twinkled , and laughter sat upon his lip :
All suddenly came , charged with tears ,
God sees " illegitimate " stamped on the brows
But thin and cold our blood hath got ,
But with the dawn his slumbers were broken ,
Retirement for the days to come ,
Pure as one purged of pain that passion bore ,
They go on such strange geometrical hinges ,
And other things that hung on lines and told
Even their memory has passed away .
Thus to the verge of battle brought
Laughing at the storms you meet ;
To ancient story any credit give . )
Things that too oft provoke the public scorn ,
Fast ran the scottish warriors there ,
For thou art nearer to him , and take heed
Save one whose heart had felt the mystic spell .
And blame those virtues which they can not share .
The holy hermit rais 'd his eyes
Of steps had worn a way . not verdant there
Showing their birth , and where they did proceed ?
But they , for doubt half touched with dread ,
Binding up wounds , but pouring in no balm .
Whose sword gave israel his inheritance ,
Of hope the praises in this height resound .
Forth rushed the murderous bands , their melted chains
And wilt thou feel less zealous to regain
Which to the ground now bends the forest green .
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
Untold ; which touched with pity every wight ;
Before the restless wind , which whirls it round ,
The fear within me woke :
And we think that we mount the air on wings
Or does the tomb take all ? if he survive
But when your playing and your voice came in ,
I met with wisdom laughing in the sun ;
And pressed this point with a present meet ,
On golden cars , their longing showed .
And bearing in his grasp the spear of truth ,
O prince , pursue but my advice ,
Despairing , lost : what countless forms of wo !
Hears when the mournful east begins to blow .
And backward life at last comes on .
To fail in one leaves those achieved in vain .
The time pass 'd on in conversation sweet ,
That god sees fit to put into my charge ,
O dream of poet passing every bound !
Doth all their names recall .
He felt all his plausible theories posed ;
The victor 's loss who made the rough ascent .
" of all the pleasures given on earth
And the snows come hurrying from the hills ,
The wind keeps , the windflowers
His midnight incantations often fell ,
The curling ocean , and corrects the tides .
As fair , as false thy glances fall ;
And drown despair , came poor verlaine .
The black prow plunges through the sea ,
What massic wines tremble beneath such stars ?
We went two and two ,
Disputes are rising every day .
Then while the night displays her awful shade ,
To all the force that britain sends .
And the moon has left her station ,
Here , where enormous shadows creep ,
He , from his face removing the gross air ,
With sheer exhaustion men already spent .
In such a mansion , as scarce thought finds words
Nor grassy plains , nor cooling streams invite .
Watching the shadows grow apace ,
Like genii set to watch the birth
From the mute elm-trees , hanging on air
Who arbitrarily made mention
Where the mists hung dark and heavy ,
The cross had shaken with his agony ,
He , whose transcendent wisdom passes all ,
Like pillars , tossed in mighty chaos , gold
Learning has borne such fruit in other days
Must come together at the last
Abode his destined hour , and went his way .
His own forefathers ' arms and armour hung .
From my own lips my boundless sorrow learn .
And softest ones that blow ,
If but with my pen i could draw him ,
Besides , what endless honor you shall gain ,
Fell their soft splendour .
The flowers that shed their leaves to-day
These sons of murder thirst thy life to take ;
That christe 's gospel truly woulde preach .
The moon pouring strange light on things more strange ,
And wild and garish semblance made
It crossed the churchyard with a sigh ,
Then added , turning to my guide his face ,
Catches the gales which blow from hill or sea ,
And dreams , or falls asleep ,
She bears the flesh , her comrade here ,
Think of what follows ; think that at the worst
Then her sickness came -- even we fellows
Must not swim the sea of anger ,
In each sail that skims the horizon ,
Spread greyly eastward , thus a chorus sang :
Reaching to tartarus , she raised her song :
The secrets held by the creatures nearer than we
Ah , julia , she that makes herself a dove
Or raising a storm to wreck the ships
And his body shrunk and dwindled
That you must find this life worth while ,
Methinks i feel new strength within me rise ,
O'er the watery gulf dread silence now lies ,
Her heart must own , so sweet a sight ,
Dread , dread the race that still remains :
And shaped it forth before the multitude
As if through parted seas , the pathway runs ,
I follow but my star :
Till crimson footprints stamp the frozen path ,
A finished style the highest art has given ,
And take this gift of heaven with grace ?
And the vain yearning woke midst festal song !
That lit the waters answered them .
Their brethren 's insults gave ,
As she found her fame departing ,
At this the king his generous joy express ’d ,
He never led a better corps to war .
Of that you may make " affidavy . "
Unconscious of sarcasm , piped away
One of god 's chosen lifted up his voice :
Of oats decorticated take two pounds ,
I would that when his fatal hour shall come ,
Would fain withdraw from that disastrous brawl .
You will find a rooted hate
And the slime lies naked , like a thing ashamed
I feel this place was made for her ;
The peopled fold thy kindly care have found ,
Whose name was blown among strange seas .
The plague of writing follows like a curse ;
Death was there if he messed the puzzle .
Brave madness , built for beauty and the sun --
“ their poverty on souls unmurmuring weigh 'd .
From pure incompetence to mar or mend them :
So maggie runs , -- the witches follow ,
So close the theme and harmony have grown
And every vice be received .
They send from each to each a troubled stare ;
And floats the music borne from seraph-strings .
Thus sprang direct towards the galaxy .
While every instant brings its fears ;
What miracles by love are wrought .
Then had the greeks eternal praise acquired ,
Is it because my cares have come ? --
Take the strength of a man .
Those holy forms the god embraced --
Since we shot the play arrows of childhood ,
More than your breath can spend .
This world of ours is ever led
Where the lordly house would stand .
Reason the bias turns to good from ill ,
And with applause it rushed
While the world went round through sleep and shade .
It fills them full of light .
The heavenly father keep his sacred brood
Could to my sight that heavenly face restore .
To make a soft death bed for me .
Nor death could change his visage -- for in act
And the pines their boughs extended .
At the kindling vision it brings ;
And leaning back , he yawned and fell asleep ,
Meeting : the brass flashed out like leaping flames .
For so the will did run .
Winter-buckskin , how they fitted !
To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark 'd !
Perchance the grasses quiver above her slumber there .
When the eastern conduits ran with wine .
To take the owlet-haunted lane ,
Still , though i noted pale decay ,
And found no ease in turning or in rest ;
" for if my father and mother got wit ,
Flatter the senses , or some fearful dream
A mystery remains alike to fools and sages .
Of kingdoms holding of the british crown ,
Reflecting nature : this one man
While sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves ;
Fearless , amidst a host of pressing fears ,
Sudden the furious winds arise ,
Gleaming lilies bathed in moonlight
Until his day came when he died ,
At first the silent lips made no reply ,
His armor laid and long unused shield ,
How through the deepest riddles he could spy ;
This , talent reproduces to a turn ,
The wicked queen her speech renewed ,
The two is found the happy mean . ”
Though nature 's terrors thus may be repress 'd ;
Virtue would stain that or with silver white .
Reaching to the clouds of heaven ,
The critic else proceeds without remorse ,
And wealth ! on whose soft bosom laid
And happiness too swiftly flies ?
Watched them till they fell asleep with weariness ,
You a larger self will find :
With torches flaring thro ' the gloom ,
I often stay the hour upon the chime
Mi kniht the field hath overcome :
The spirit of the brook was stirred ,
The simple board they spread ;
Which makes the angels greedy for its fruit ,
And join thy voice unto the angel quire ,
Put heaven 's stars to shame ,
Goes with greatness .
Terror and death glared where he went ;
And straight on balanced pinions soared away ,
Whom frightened ignorance and sin 's appall
Fear seized the mighty , and unnerved the brave ;
Of belial , flown with insolence and wine .
Dwellings of bliss that opening shone ,
One moment thwarted us , or died away ,
So runs it in thy blood to choose
The gales blow grateful , and the vessel flies .
Their tide of power tis ours to stem --
Echoed her blasphemies , as with shrill voice
Of those , who load them with committed sin .
Her supple outlines fixed in clay
So , through the thunder comes a human voice
Both messengers their leave of him do take ,
Each day new paradise to build ;
To what you counted pastime ; she has wept
The sparking dew-drops will not stay .
Since commerce first to avarice gave
To hold communion with his god ! to trace
Through the frosty windows fall
They tore green branches from the trees
Her bosom swelled with joy and pride .
A tread as if all the world were coming .
A banner floated in the air ,
Not yet has passed thy life blood from the wound
Cups of sorrow we yet shall drain ;
I met that other tide as i desired .
But sad spectators , to the hero came :
The bitter blast that round me blaws ,
And were going about rejoicing and defying
Love gives it energy , love gave it birth .
To my heart 's hailing make reply ,
Scented as it passes !
How do these starry notes proclaim
Come wealth or want , come good or ill ,
And lilith roses dipped in wine ,
And from doing it nothing would come but good ,
When sleepy dullness joins their train ?
And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away .
And thou in vain art robbed of bliss .
And how with party madness to engage , )
Then touched to praise its tones in sweetness broke ,
With bibles great to turn them o'er ,
To make the ashes which things old and new
No stars in heaven could shine more fair ,
Where winds breathe soft , and wild-flowers grace
And thro ' a vast that was never passed
A fragrance the astonished sense receives ,
And passion , erst unknown , could gain
And bathed in fragrant oils that breathed of heaven :
He strikes the chords of ecstasy and woe ,
Whatever things hope promises to thee . "
And with those gifts no poisons blend ,
Signs make thy soul afraid ,
Is but ruined by his witchcraft ;
For i placed my mighty hope in
The air is full of countless voices , joined
And thether cloudesle went .
You see the fates have given him so much ,
But finds some work to do ,
That wander unto aweful wars and press
The blood in rivers streamed from tent to tent ,
His fortunes battled , whether rome should pass
Take all the freedoms of a married life ;
She warbled handel ; it was grand --
That made men 's hearts rejoice to see his face
Which came from the soul of the organ ,
Watching the secrets of the plains unfold ;
To some accomplishment , i give my voice
There sweet contentment builds her nest ,
What pleasant fields for this before us lie !
Thrills quickened with the draught of life ,
On rich and poor alike they fall ,
That keeps my love away ,
The art to make this speak is raised thereby
Thought followed thought -- and ere the last
With perforated heart unbreathing swims ,
Love is of false men embraced ;
And crimson light struck soft the phosphor wave .
The sun was newly glancing on the earth .
That no truth shines athwart the lies :
The yankees raised a cheer --
And the fret lies on me .
All songs that seek the sun ,
And trodden heather , mixing with the voice
They took him from all those he loved ,
The dreadful amazons sustain the fight ,
Death makes our foe our brother ;
" love " comes aptly in when gruff
Each that draws is a swan or a dove ,
And the curses rose in chorus .
The barrier that no human strength could burst .
To vast extent her exports reaches ,
Where he the ring might lay .
Which send a radiance through the heavens wide .
Love sighs in sympathy , with pain combined ,
And puts a fever like spring 's in the cheek
To raise a bounty noble as thy soul ;
The mist-like banners clasped the air ,
In his emprizes have not spared their gore .
Set the magical springs of my fancy in play ,
And irremovable ) gracious openings lie ,
Heart of the world give heed ,
Of whom the fame is hidden in the past .
But all of the things that belong to the day
Whatever worth the enchanted boons may bear ,
An additional couplet follows in the manuscript :
And toll of all their leagues he took :
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of may ,
First she such pity moved and then disdain ,
When night came , that releases man from toil ,
With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels .
Two cloves -- i make my language brief --
For heathen heart that puts her trust
If crystal streams " with pleasing murmurs creep , "
A tear steals furtively down his nose
And in the game where four should stand ,
That sedentary shadow travels hard .
And add the sanction of considerate age ;
They bore our banner splendid .
Her sons round her banner would rally with pride ,
Others his truth and faithfulness shall see .
Ever drew up the silver sand of hope !
Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes
Has the goal drawn since we started ,
Death came , and two lips murmured low ,
As poplars feel the rain and then straightway
All happy sights and sounds now came to him
And mangled bore away the sinewy part .
Speak through your eyes and all his love engage ;
Taking the air with their aunts and wives .
Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds ?
Which rendered him unjustly merciless ,
That overspread my life ,
Of labor and her illness came again
Sweet and bitter supplied by luck ,
No profane numbers must flow near
Ripe cherries cast a crimson light ,
Rise like a hand stretched toward the sky
( the sunlight wanes upon the sea ) --
She lifted up the charm : appealing groans
Of some clear river , issuing from a lake ,
He saw strange somethings rise and dip ;
Then came thy shameful sin with lancelot ;
Filling life with youth and beauty ,
The boon on which thy heart is set .
Give birth to hopes and fears .
The wish thy mind thinks fit to frame .
" life was a blessing by thy maker meant ,
There lay the fierce and hideous foe ,
Wide as his will , extends his boundless grace ;
To-night at roslin leads the ball ,
As from the south the fiercer breezes rise
And , ere the breath of life was spent ,
Now let hearts shrink from scythes that drink
Should say our stock was petered out ,
" we 'll bear the pall . "
Where the colors danced and shifted
Soft cords of silk the whirling spoles reveal ,
The waters sullenly clash and murmur .
" knows love is strong to save and lift
Then midst my pity for their lost delight ,
The constellated flowers that never set ;
With an eye that takes the breath ;
The saw went tearing thru the oak
Whose waters ran beneath the hill ,
That he has turned to sighs .
He often found some constellation
Of water-birth that washes free from sin .
And harder for the heart to overcome ,
That makes the springtime fair for me .
In resolution taken from the sun
Give birth to new religious phantasies .
Gives plaintive ditties to the heedless wind ,
To raise the cash for races here ;
But lives a life she would exchange for death .
Sound only was made for pain .
A voice came down the wild wind ,
While business in the occident goes on
The altar of a brutish mood to hide .
Yet heaven will shed a soothing beam ,
This course served well to strengthen what was weak ,
That steep and narrow scale admits to climb .
When desperately the british charge was made .
And though my love for thee would greatly dare ,
Which they unheeded passed -- not dreaming then
That do arise from painful melancholy ;
The one that touched my youth --
And if my fate so early had not chanced ,
Glows in our veins , and opens every soul ,
Sharply i pass the terse orders down .
Where dark clouds hang and torrents roar ;
And i 've yet to waft me distant ,
Those whom love 's sleepless yearning would draw near .
And the congo is reluctantly compelled to own the truth
Not sunk in carnal pleasure , for which cause
Caught in the web of the years that pass ,
I wait for butterflies to pass .
With certain rhymes 't is hard to deal ;
And in the ripple flows the mighty deep .
To mark the race and make a true report .
He climbed through darkness to the twilight air ,
We will set secret sail for sicily .
Where maids have spent their hours .
Was issuing forth from ganges with the scales
Birds here make song , each bird has his ,
Where dancing sun-beams on the waters played ,
How when his wrath was stirred
While others images for altars give ;
What plato saw , in ages fled ,
There once again , as evening fell
Silent and calm the river rolled along ,
It follows the way which the forces have planned .
His knowledge of good lost , and evil got ;
The banquet placed them , where the beach was spread
Active it finds , to its own substance draws ,
Too mean to bring ; a promise , their adored
And many dreadful fears beset her ,
Of her whose face and voice made melodies ,
And from her lips that sad voice came
Ah ! dreams that did not rise from sense ,
Alive , and breathing still , nor yet subdued ;
At his touch he felt new courage
And the moon discovers that they all have lovers ,
Through all the moods that pass ;
So stand the nations thine no more .
Longing , it seems , to join the pretty play
Then to my ear transmit some gentle song ,
And with his reverent fingers sought to close
A way , and fixed his wavering choice ,
One single charm in these maids to note ,
Her equal yoke would sit with ease ;
And a terrible stillness came :
Still sent its glittering stream forth into air ,
And grind you into ashes in his wrath . "
And his heart outran his footsteps ;
In hollow murmurs died away .
The storm that swept through battle-days ,
The mounting soul , the call by jesus given .
Or beam with genius or with beauty more .
He modest merit sought to find ,
Shall ever a morning bring
By my ancestors should i this cause maintain .
But now i felt hot , desperate kisses cast
Time takes too much from me ,
Till bullets clipt an angle ,
This is time to break with slumber ,
Which makes thee wonder ; and so purge the cloud
The poets , who on earth have made us heirs
To guide the footsteps of the wise ,
Ruby tears there came ;
Of all the battle where the caucons stood .
On brows of prayer a blessing pour ;
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
But all of the things that belong to the day
So from his bearded lips there came
Felt as they made her griefs their own ,
It entered in , it filled that sacred place
How to the circle fitted , and therein
For every penny he hath taken thee fro ,
Who , though he carries but a doubtful trace
Whose base took its rest amid everlong motion
From those that hold it merit to rebel ,
That made it possible , but is forgotten
Beg bitter bread through realms their valour saved ,
And grinning faces peer out of the gloom --
But fate the word has spoken :
Following the valley 's labyrinthine winding ,
To share the greatness of imperial rome .
They thrilled me so , the tears came fast ;
One little boat gave up its strife ,
My heart would wish it broke before ,
Sad and compassionate to weeping make me .
New regiments he placed and weapons new .
The moving whisper of huge trees that branch 'd
There came on thee the lust of these .
From our hot records then thy name shall stand
She drove at once . so fell the overthrow ,
And flashing like a color pyre ,
Terror of foemen , backed with gold ,
God filled her eyes with innocence and love ,
When a desolate feeling comes over us stealing ;
The mortal wound of rich elatus gave ,
Spit boiled with blood
To lower sails and gather in the lines ;
Above grey mosses whispering of leaves
Yet o’er the silvery surface pure they flow ,
From nature 's chain whatever link you strike ,
Goes seeking those that have gone astray , --
And not with lying tongue your oath evade . "
But as yet no name was given ,
If i should fail , his beams will see
Of bourbon . this would dissipate the glory .
Or , breaking not with woe and with distress ,
In limbo -- the lean moon was led .
Which a wind to pearl hath kissed ,
Rises the mist of my pain --
Addressed the fiend with moving words ,
Which down to earth these legates bore ,
While the sun is taking leave ,
Which by and by black night doth take away ,
The little sin thou clingest to .
That there with measure they no spending made .
Lest the sad change their hearts might rend ,
Redden and pour their bright fires all abroad .
To stain with guilt affection 's tear ,
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me ,
A comfort bring such as kind mothers use .
Last of all the shrunk december
That neckan heaven might gain .
As it dies into the sunset glow ;
Pitying the lonely man , and gave him it :
The mingling notes came soften 'd from below :
A second , as a stitch she took ;
They have set their teeth to the pole ;
With terror wing 'd conveys the dread report .
May be pounded into atoms ,
An angel in the dark . a while it lies
The sun has gone down , spreading wide on
Drawn by thy message , face to face ,
And in the roaring whirlpools rush the tides ,
Was the first counsel that was given by christ .
And life in verse shall lay the poet dead .
Who shall pierce to thy naked splendour ,
The sky broke out in red dismay
But , ah , it grew to stormy weather
And my breast it heaved with sighs ,
In some of our own sex we find .
Surveyed the globe as ' round it rolled ,
As i praised god and gave thanks to him .
That made it plunges through the wound again ,
Because , before they reached their place of rest ,
Her dream , with feast and rioting to blend ;
That find a voice : serenest years ,
High festival will hold for saint michael .
All that we feel is old ;
God knows what they were feeling , with their white
' twould taint creation were it not confined .
A smile upon the wan lips told
Meanwhile , do you find that surprising ?
That feels our agony and tears ,
Piercing the eyes , shrinking the throat ,
His wife primmed lips and took the till .
Fair forms of light that crowd the distant air ,
There 's shakespeare 's home to raise a bid ,
That eateth up children .
But what a friend in him did find .
So streamed the vision through his sunken eye ,
And like a spectre of an age departed ,
And while the face lies quiet there ,
Sunshine and gladness may smilingly wear ;
To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal .
And holy vows made hateful , save thou speak
Ah , they give their faith too oft
But most of all abhorrence take
King corsablis the next drew nigh ,
Must look for human frailty ,
With their fists they burst asunder
The holiness it might not share ,
And milton 's house its price would bring .
Relief awhile unto her aching head .
Critics wears no smile of fun ,
That ire and wrath exiled reason quite .
Close following pace for pace , not mounted yet
Within these deeps to lie ,
With bending neck , no litter bore his form .
How womanly you were , have grown to be ?
Its empires may topple and fall :
Affliction wore him down , tormented sore
This year 's blossoms , clinging in its coils ?
And think the wild too good to lose .
I knew life 's tragedy was played the while ;
Whatever it be , i take my luck ,
Beyond the water gave him back the cry .
And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts ,
The day climbs high , but sinks at last .
And wept the north that could not find relief .
Now gladys gave him her sunniest smile --
The spring is come , or if it stay
The welcome by this people shown to such .
Swifter than lightning went these wonders rare ;
Our voices only broke the gloom .
An eminence , though fancied , turns the brain :
There 's nothing makes a better bed than ferns
At my departure o what tears there fell !
Long centuries have come and gone .
Our hearts went with him to the grave .
Revere himself , and find the god within .
Where the light of life has fled ,
All the joy my life had known ,
Dreaming the very dreams you hold ,
Amid a great town stood my father 's house .
Our footsteps in the search may guide . ”
Nor in her panic seeks to choose her ground ,
With endless change is fitted to the hour ;
Through which came flowing , flowing , flowing ,
And heights where morning wakes
Where the spine joins it . not more furiously
Who feel by reason and who give by rule ,
The frost that freezes the life at my heart ,
Then took the shelter of the neighbouring wood .
Whose presence brings no discord to the scene !
Be all of such moments made up ;
Like one that had been led astray
Would fix our favorite on the scene ,
They turn to me in sorrowful thought ;
Still onward rolls the thunderous caravan ,
To guard the faith , to win mankind ,
His selfish hope , he finds the grace ,
And when his blossoms fly ,
And o'er the dungeon cast a dreadful shade ;
Still sought it , for their destiny prevailed .
To keep me happy all the day .
Has left me sadly wearied . "
Than one fool more to make the world complete ?
Came her whisper : " o my heart !
See what a smile their red lips wear ;
So will these modern temples pass away ,
Which with no flower salutes the ardent day ,
That glad to-morrow may bring certain bliss ?
Give thy fair spouse evil treatment ,
And ranker grows its power : from hardest rocks
Then comes sweet hope and bravely dares
He returned to join the snow-sledge ,
Was struck with astonishment .
I must go on learning endlessly )
The anger of the prince has stirred .
Than youth conceal 'd in thine .
Or scale olympus where the muses pitch their tents .
Come the undying thoughts i bear ?
I in their camp who still maintained the fray ,
But art comes dear the way the money goes .
Our hearts discern wild images of death ,
Life was made greater by their sweetheart prayers .
Thy mourning makes my sorrow sad :
At thy name all our hearts own a thrill ,
Time health gave life its old longevity ,
Who will come to give him counsel ,
That made monotonous burden to their rhymes ,
His pensive brow the generous care express ’d
Let satan bind , with chains of fire ,
The moving words of angad drew
Will crown the changing seasons as they pass ,
Not from herself her fame of strength she took ,
The golden age that lives in poets ' strains ,
Till it sorrowfully trailed in the dust .
Gay banners floated to the wind ,
These had hephaestus fashioned for his gift
We know none other , to approach with prayer ,
The life that wears , the spirit that creates
And his heart within him fluttered ,
Your soul shall starve not ; all about you sweeps
And pitious lamentation did make ;
Now seize the occasion , now the troops survey ,
Which nature 's homely art had made ,
For my perfection made you feel
From giant oaks , that wave their branches dark ,
I bar no reader 's application .
They brave the terrors of the dreary flood ,
But the snowpeaks rise aloft
And down he lays his weary bones .
Triumphantly swelled up to meet the keels .
And wail upon wail went up to the stars
Can come the lucid morning 's fragrant breath
When winter casts its mantle white and cold ,
New interest came to the mind of sym ,
Relaxes , though it does not break .
And her glad voice the strain prolongs .
The beacons blazed , the banners flew ,
And bards and minstrels swelled the crowd .
A royal line may leave no heir ;
That lights the sun and makes the planets sing ;
Now from her hair would twine a musky chain ,
And where'er my footsteps wander ,
It saves the soul by drowning sin .
The second for that fell encounter stood ,
We have obscured god 's face with partial truths ,
And her words are such as follow :
The god that made it , came the steadfast strength
The pain must give way to peace .
Adown her cheek a salt tear stole ;
Still with sheep my memories go ,
Then back to pyle triumphant take my way .
Where the brightness of morning shines on but to gain
The chiefs return ; divine ulysses leads .
Against rude rocks the billows dash :
To show that no malice or envy he knew ,
But the ancient foe , deluded by whose say ,
This made , aboven every creature ,
I know thee not : i feel afraid :
Find sufficient shelter there . "
In sallow stars stabs the gray dark ;
Longer than books can tell -- and it were strange
Of flickering horror in the sectors where
Looking out for number one
For him their powers employ ;
Like them in tears it sets ,
And no proud honour to thyself redounds .
Half is mine , although i follow ;
It has put them to infinite pain ,
Fuel enough they had to feed the flame ;
Is it the wind that moaneth bleak ?
Of other care they little reckoning make ,
Above the blackness of the swelling tide ,
While sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves ;
And heaven shall act as we direct the way .
On the marble pavement trailing .
Then grateful greece with streaming eyes would raise ,
When it stirs the pines , and sultry day
A worthy lord this day has found .
Of airs that clasp him with her dress ,
I gave the boys money to start in business .
Here stands to tell the tale of him ,
Tears coursed , tears human ,
And young sensation permeates the brain .
To bear false witness , and to spread reports
Heavy and dim , and she renewed her woe .
From thy bright eyes he took his fires ,
His foeman 's scutcheon tied .
Here they stand to-night --
That sheds a lying glory on old stones
Assuage the pain , and give me strength to urge
High fame his youthful might has won .
The funny things to make us smile .
Why raise the eden , yet retain the sin ?
His foul proscription passes without blame .
His father lost , must many a pang endure .
Making full circle of our banishment ,
Far from his cot the hero drew .
And lips that speak of the days of old .
She held with thine a kindred sway ,
The look of her heart slipped out and in .
And from below comes a scarce audible sound ,
The whole lovely day spent molding bodies
Over the sad earth blindly go .
In heaven , the arches rang ;
Then home the jests were driven ,
Where his father sank in death .
How , rippled sunshine blown thro ' air ,
" what tho ' their founder filled with miracles
Great was the glory then gained in the fight
But still with love no death could chase ,
And dusky evening found them joyous still .
That makes his face a radiant miracle !
“ and then the yellow sand upon me threw .
Upon each fearful sight that raised
That every hyacinth the garden wears
And thus the pious man you see
And the clouds that pass )
A flare went up ; the shining whiteness spread
Such cares as these disturb their everlasting calm !
Or calm it lies , with canvas furled .
Is found the cadence of her voice ,
Her finger nails dug sharp into her palm .
So , smiling as at first went she .
Where heaps of gay flowers burying half the feet
It blew and made such tempeste ,
Give me that world that never failed me then ,
This heart retains ;
To the wood she went for berries ,
To bear a part in everlasting lays ;
From life 's oppression freed .
Thus circled round the song of glee ,
The mild antiphonies that melt and kiss ,
That made _ her _ face the whitest !
There fell such shade , our paths seemed laid
Where art thou ? age succeeds to age ;
“ my lord has gained a friend in thee ,
For i already perceive here tears and defiance beforehand .
To make it clear , turn homer 's page
They triumphed , and less bloody rites were kept
On the heaving surges tossed ;
Juan contrived to give an awkward blow ,
The radiance came , and with it bore
Torn , triumphant , drowned in bliss .
And roderick , with thine anguish stung ,
More spacious making more our home ,
Gardens and stairways . they belong with song --
To priam godlike hector owes his birth .
Their saints , and clouds of incense heavenward streamed ,
The moss reprints more tenderly
A shadow that lifts clear and floats --
The valiant prince his little army led :
From scotland 's bonnie land it came ,
Answered in the words that follow :
Night ’s sombre mantle is spreading over ,
All smiles come in such a wise
For spring at last has come ,
They sought for scientific truth ,
The approach of eve ; already nature feels
The priests made lamentation and passed in
With infinite surge of mountains surfed with snow ,
I sink back shuddering from the quest .
For morn is approaching your charms to restore ,
The shore-surge comes in ripples light ,
With eager longing is possessed .
Follow where mighty khara leads .
The knowledge that brings guilt and woe .
Her tragic mask she turned upon all men :
For neither so comes the bird to harm ,
Nor grief , nor pleasures breed him any pain ,
And as she viewed her children ’s woe ,
Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . '
We give them scorn for scorn .
Out of the book that chronicles the past .
Filling all the earth with bliss ;
Fades away the lovely daylight ,
Which the thief had took to ride .
Joy follows woe , woe after joy comes flying .
That were between us . when the silence comes ,
And a spear yet filled with courage ,
As when the bridegroom leads the bride ,
Our simple life wants little , and true taste
Set on thy sighing lips shall make thee glad ;
Much was fantastic . all was touched with light
We may find pleasure : wilderness and wood ,
One care remains , to note the loyal few
This each one felt who went ,
Of clubs formed by women to rescue the nation
The passing smile her cheek put on ;
But then his horses got their due .
The constellations meet , but through benign
Like the shy eyes love has veiled .
How softly sinks his trembling sun
The greater blessedness preserves the more .
With fiction then does real joy reside ,
View on yon plain the real glories rise .
And broke the silence following the last appalling thud
Upon the payne that thereof follow may .
Will interpose , and bring us better days .
Could hide the soul , yet how you have mistaken
They sing of love that 's grown desirous ,
When april rounded into may :
I gave the world the fruit of earlier hours :
And hailed the last resort of fruitless love .
Can force this virtue , change his soyl :
And lean years to come .
And , from the foe the great example take .
From small to huge that fury 's stature grew ;
Inhale the liberal beam , and melt in love ;
Though foreign foes bring frightful war ,
They feel like us the turns of fate :
Turned to the palace , worn with woe .
Fresh water from the fount sank trembling down ,
Or give such order , then , with added cords
The wind blackens the bitter soul .
With sated steel -- and liberty restored !
I am torn , torn with thy beauty ,
Which makes the angels greedy for its fruit ,
" cupid ! " venus went a-crying ;
So near the ground she plied her art ,
Had smothered down her shrieking ,
He placed his camp : then sought the further hills
Deep , wily eyes fixed on the darting fish
Of the great waves that beat the crumbling shore .
A stray leaf floated from those happier shores ,
Made promise of the way her sect enjoins .
That gave each winding law and poyze ,
The arrow reached -- transfixed the wretch 's throat ,
To kowno bears a mighty army 's shouts ,
But thou must make a different choice . "
Take time to be holy ;
Yet i bear a heart shall support me still .
Or the mad seas bid her stay ?
Of those , who load them with committed sin .
It came to her in that hushed grove ,
That ocean feeds the sun and heavenly fires ,
Yet moving many matters in her mind ,
And , cleaving heaven its own to claim ,
She spake ; nor made she victory as yet
So , looking into the eternal light ,
" out of this nothingness arose our thought !
The other , by that purest love made pure ,
Went wading down the west , through drifting clouds .
That grasps the nearest stem with tendril rings ;
Down fell the gory hand ; the darkling shades
This day , o sire , thine eyes shall see
Our stately drove we follow .
And raghu ’s son his answer made :
For he gives them rest where the twigs are red
Terror has crept beneath your ocean wall ,
No flaw deforms , no difficulty thwarts ,
Now justice comes all trouble to repair ,
My rare youth came and spoke my name ,
But little stars may hide them when they list .
The wildest storm the tongue can raise ,
This virtue shrinks , and in a corner lies
The master with his eye is following so . "
Their sons , they gave , their immortality .
Loudly they talked of his money that 's gone ,
To guard his growth the planets seven
His strokes once more on the brown rock fell ,
It is not time that makes eternity .
In lifting up my flower of love to you
That parts in her no pride could raise }
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain . "
Till memory loses her power ,
That banner , that banner bring hither ,
Of outside colour is thrown off , there 's naught
The morning 's golden glamour lies .
Nor show me such similitude of god .
Shall blare away the staid official thought .
From birth , ere once again a hold is given
Taking the shape of angels , to our hearts ,
To golden-winged iris gave command :
Amphimachus and nastes led to fight
And there shall fourteen years be spent
Upon her wings presents the god unshorn :
It came upon the midnight clear ,
My dreamed-of swirl of passion never came ,
The world is occupied with men
He said -- and , light as bridegrooms bound
As that which makes thy whisper fate ,
Poetry also shall leap with new life ,
A wondrous light was thrown upon thy face ;
And sleep brings refreshment when dreaming of thee .
And now the ice is fairly broken .
Was kindled toward the fiery play
Yet winter , too , can boast a wealth
The ruthless king , should want of me be felt
To bind our lovely friendship fast ,
Emotion swayed me at the thought of these .
' twould lay us open to our foes ;
Come , i venture to give you my word ,
That rolls a stream of foamy blood , —
We make of our pain god ;
In thee no sorrow may be found ,
The water in the runway made its din .
To swell our nuptial song !
To fill the earth with peace and joy ,
Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end ,
Him lodgings fair he gave , wherein to dwell
A holier silence thrills and overawes ;
The wasted weeks had tripped him , the fierce hours
Loved without youth , and followed without power ;
Had wafted to eternal fame !
Let storms forbear those cradle beds .
" love that holds high discourse within mind , "
Here as i take my solitary rounds ,
That will not rouse the crack of doom .
The same will come , you 'll find :
One little wandering arm is thrown
Useless resistance make : with eager strides
The curtain draws o ' nature 's rest ,
And canst not sing till night be gone ,
Like red leaves be swept away !
That lay in the house that jack built .
That gave me fever , and the spleen !
Last , he reached his arms to sleep ,
To the foil 'd searching of mortality ;
Is it where mosses and violets meet ,
We traced the golden clouds of spring ,
My heart shall reap where it has sown
And here , where buzzing nations choked the ways ,
Till helen ’s woes at full revenged appear ,
And my worldly rest hath gone
And makes the foolish mocker bold .
You seize the flower , its bloom is shed !
To his interment we would give the tenth ,
When quakers all turn soldiers ,
The moonbeam , sliding softly in between
With such fell cruelty were seen , their goads
A thousand ruthless blows to deal .
A smile that shone as death may shine
The world is brimmed with moonlight ,
Looking for no recompense ,
And to his horses strength and courage gave .
England 's blest laws will set him clear ;
The king of hearts called for the tarts ,
And sudden rage brought forth , and sudden war .
Their virtue great , which by itself did fly ,
Or dwells humanity where riot reigns ?
Thy crown of stars will never break ,
Heroes themselves had fallen behind ! --
To trail in the waves of ruby wine ,
Shaken with pain ; sister of birds and yet
In its top , there shines the moonlight ,
Then sculpture and her sister arts revive ,
But soon a gentler feeling crept
Gray grows to crimson , crimson melts to gold ,
Her wifely love the dame has led
Majestic forms of mighty monarchs rise .
Welcomed by night and ruin , hollow falls
His army , and in fury said :
Which beats the dark red realm of pain ,
The clock struck twelve , the noon had come .
Their soldiers new , when swords and weapons shone
Thus their prayer was raved and passed :
But , heedless of the following gloom ,
And of the happiest moments which were wrought
That every language knows , --
Which made a wiser man than thou once err
To-morrow death may make his blow ;
Defying prurient modesty turned she ,
And quenching thirst is earlier than cups .
It came to an end ,
To chase the moral maladies of man ;
He springs , and there shows mercy unto none .
( putting aside your heartlessness
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
Try it . it takes every power you know .
The boat close by had spread its saffron sails ,
That honor 'd chapel she had hung around
That brings us either ale or beer ;
He washed his soul in the west wind
Her sad face sideways thrown .
The trouble that they gave , their immorality ,
And , scornful of the peace that flies
Where i can feel the end of things complete ,
That very few can feel beside ,
The symbols of his grief would bear about .
Might wash away my grief !
To see thy charms displayed .
Me phoebus and my ruthless fate combined
Far onward pressed the vánar band ;
The inward fairness , which is blurred and lost
Could man but leave thy bright creation so ,
A war not waged for empire or domain ,
The horrid shock : now storming furie rose ,
They saw how eastward stretched in order long ,
When monarchs ' lives are laid at stake ,
Go , in an empty dream lost joys regain
Of age we may take with a smile ;
And was cast into destruction ,
Your worldly worship moved her then ;
But fortune , that doth often frown
And shunning shameful strife where peace should dwell ,
This wall shall by the waves be broken through ,
His life in home of giants passed ,
In the 1788 version two lines follow :
To spread all the charms they together could find .
He hates his rival . " thinking thus he leads
In lingering labyrinths creep ,
The adriatic billows dash and fall ,
And of verbs that take the dative :
Singing joy to the brave that delivered their charms ,
What ills would attend a reform of mankind --
A little wind goes sifting
Nor would , which makes me bond and free ,
And she dropped me a curtsey .
Which rests irresolute , and lets it lie .
With huge stones brave aeneas made defence .
Her wealth may fail -- her commerce droop
The idle paddle you so lately held ,
What made my heart beat with exulting love
And truths divine came mended from that tongue .
In other peril , soon as i had mounted ,
And all his brow is clouded with a grief .
That the french host to sure destruction ran ,
For the mercy which i now finde ,
Where the immortal dead have sate ,
Companioned by the sweetest , ay renewed ,
At the epiphany , will bear it soon ,
The stream of heavenly love on earth must flow ;
( red rose leaves will never make wine )
Cold and neglected , spread the marble floor .
It entangles the shafts of the noon ,
Now that the nightingale has made its voice heard ,
But fixed his word , his saving power remains :
And set you square with genesis again --
Since first men planted foot and hand was king :
An elephant the sound had made .
A face with gladness overspread ;
Dark hollows seem to glide along and chase
Paradise spent , and wage for merits given ,
To the beauty of earth that fades in ashes ,
Which , laying hold on universal laws ,
Thus the nameless fish made answer :
And filled the yellow world with flame .
And my pulses beat with rapture in the blisses
The greatest lords and princes thence she drew ;
The mandate of the king obeyed
Who , following hannibal , had passed across
Touching a little on the world to come .
Nothing could conquer that heart of thine .
And thy relenting heart would kindly warm .
And cromwell rose to power on charles 's head ?
Rhythms of anguish from a breaking lyre .
The morning came , and not one guiding ray
The night went on with me into my dream .
To stand between captivity and thee .
That sowed our enemies in her field for seed
The very charms it tries to hold ,
To speak in order what hath chanced .
In short , he got his worship up
Achaians , whom i could recall to mind ,
Mistook for light of morn the light which sank .
Wilt thou give the bride affianced ?
Already tait 's colours are struck ,
Our hearts still whispering , thou art near !
From this moment take command ,
And of augustus him a god would make .
Whose pious wishes still directed were ,
Inside me ' ere that makes me feel i own
But not a single couplet could he muster ;
Shifting her side , short respite seeks from pain .
Of woe and terrors and thick darkness reared .
Of a true heart , turns to the flowers ?
Whichever wind may meetest blow .
The grim king marked his changeless cheek :
The sails at noon left off their tune ,
So trouble stayed in the land of gosh ;
Her feet disperse the powdery snow ,
While war lays hand on greece ,
She leaves her star supreme ,
Melt them to pity with maternal tears --
Give wondrous beauty to the view .
Along the springing grass had run ,
Naught shall pluck thee from my hands . "
With lords and princes set about his grace ;
The healing days shall close the darkness up
Eager they grasp the gifts which culture yields ,
Take but this poesy that now followeth
That which still makes her mirth to flow ,
Shattered the mountain as it came .
In rosy revel thy spirit shall pass away .
“ and gave the omen of a friendly power .
Giving the tempest time to spend ;
His goodness doth before them pass ,
But set the snare to make confession mine .
Thus all the mountains and great hills shall fly ;
Through the lone forest held their pensive way .
And find my rest .
His flaxen hair in ringlets stood
And his tongue shall be filled with praise .
The saddened robins flit through leafless trees ,
Shall leave no vestige of this flower .
Then the heroes well considered ,
While peace of mind is surely gained ,
Of those enchanting eyes , whose glances stray
The flashes come and go ;
Ah love , that thou art immortal i see !
To-morrow comes december ;
In this strife must bear a part ;
His sons have caught the fiery zeal ;
And it never makes a sound .
How still the dancer lies ,
A wreath that twined each starry form around ,
Backward and forward will saw love in twain .
A thing which would have posed adam to name ;
Here fashions reign , and modes prevail ,
Though no wind followed , streaming in the sail ,
It ranks among the slavish fry ,
With patient soul pursued the heavenly wing .
What black procession slowly makes approach ? --
Would make it death to part .
Let death be felt and the proof remain :
To strangle right , to poison freedom 's spring ?
Where scarce the moving moon could pass ;
Austerity , a place set out for wisdom
Of the spirit born of freedom ,
Of an age gone by .
Therefore the old days passed .
And then a curious thought came in my brain :
Shews most . of spirit still is born
" thou never canst thy crime conceal ,
I must bear my woes forlorn .
Love never more could touch my wasteful heart
Till my love should come to shore .
You find a trace of days of old .
But opposite in leveld west was set
Him whom her son mature experience owns ,
In the trials that remain :
A storm of mighty billows broke and passed .
Yielded ; and thus the story ran .
The crested lark hath closed his wandering wing .
After he reached to man 's estate ,
Were as the rock that spread beneath and pierced ;
And every side of wavering combat tries ;
No charm in aught beside i trace ;
Nor his old lies with newer lies destroys .
Her fate when it should come ; and merciful sleep
To raise his brows at the rest of us .
Thought not of change in what he found ;
Of ruin onward rushing upon himself
Falls and the silence covers me .
Love , in you , went passing by ,
And on thy altars sacrifices lay ;
Is the faithless olive faded ?
Then with his heart consumed with woe ,
Delirium flapping its thigh-bones ;
But yesterweek where the cloud waves rolled
All my heart is buried with you ,
You bet , they get the icy boot !
How easy to keep free from sin !
Prayer falls in rain to make broad rivers run
Then , stirred with a purpose supreme and grand ,
In marching columns their purpose pursue .
As sad the winds sink low
The sages who have well considered this world of
Has come between them , they from rites of love
Where every day my footfall should have lit
The hermit smiling made reply
The time for payment comes , early or late ,
Still run on poets in a raging vein ,
Or lamech , out of ages lost , --
Make merry when the dance is going !
Nor how it makes the sudden lilies push
And who commanded -- and the silence came --
But tell of days in goodness spent , --
To catch his gift of the loaves and fishes .
And the copper-bells rang music ,
Souls of sorrow bring their gleam
And immortal the moment hung ;
That slowly bring to light their languid flowers .
Until they came to that soul-harrowing scene .
Where grew the arts of war and peace ,
My folly at least revealed those three great laws ;
From great disdain of others it is born ,
Over the face of the leader came ;
With a propriety that none can feel ,
Hangs the great silence like a pall
In lingering labyrinths creep ,
And with the grass its gold was spun .
Where the springs of joy were found ,
One groan the indignant spirit gave ,
The new leaf ever pushes off the old .
I have held converse with large things ;
Or flash about the spacious theatre .
From the dark thickets of the forest broke ,
Silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre ,
Before one cry from their white lips broke ,
A vision hovering on a sea of fire ,
Thou ' lt break my heart , thou bonnie bird
Has gone with life 's first leaf and bud .
Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire .
And let the soul float away in a swoon
That covers your golden hair -- my pet .
The dame made a curtsey ,
That leads the soul from a diviner air ;
That nature hung in heaven , and filled their lamps
Had further sleep a further pleasure made ;
Joy , that transcends all sweetness of delight .
Let these people go in peace .
Imagination in you stirred depicts
And the age changed unto a mimic play
And tales of terror jostle on the road ;
My fever 'd thoughts will pass away .
And made resolve to speed his wooing on
And , my blood with sorrow drying ,
Creep up , as though to take us unawares ,
Men have named beauty . thy great leaves enfold
A spirit fore-ordained to cope with wrong ,
Free as he goes , how brave he shows ,
By lofty hills , whose only pass is held ,
Such are the blessed to brighten human life --
The soft south whither thine heart is set ?
In bold type puts his name ?
The panic chill will not depart ; --
Is poured upon us . caesar 's swords at last
Mercy and truth live with thee ! and forbear
He found it distasteful to live all alone ;
Where had i to look for counsel ?
The cloudy moon is , having spent her light .
Till they had sworn to observe an evil use .
When hungry they feel ,
And the future brings a garland
That made me save this fellow . there you smile
Sparkles aloft , and makes the draught divine .
He doth give his joy to all :
A widow rich , who gives high wages ,
But now thine incense rises , and i see
Or a sigh may disperse from that flower ;
They gently sunk beneath the swelling tide .
And how merry the wheel did go !
Can let their veins run cold .
That watched in indra ’s palace lay .
In the green meadows the tall grass stood fair ,
" captivity led captive , war o'erthrown ,
Here nature laid asleep in her own urn
Than creep through narrow ways the light to gain --
In passive ease they leave the world to chance .
And soothly it is passing chaste .
Dim through her struggling sense the light came slow ,
Lays its weight on sea and mountain .
And boldly made a fierce encounter strong ,
To give instructions to the british youth ;
Answered in the words which follow :
Every day recurrent brings ;
Around such hours but makes them cast
That meets him through the changing nights and days
Mother takes by calculation
" until the gods and demons drop asleep ,
The sun just shines on her old white head .
Their city and their splendid courts we reach 'd .
Sighs or words we are fain to give ,
And to bestow on others , much shall save ,
They viewed the coming danger ,
The vase extending to receive the blood .
And found their newest thoughts as old as time --
And touched with the sunset 's glow ,
And saw how athens stood a sunlit while
The trial now over and guiltless appear ;
Where chance may fix my next vocation
When the sun holds the zenith . delving there ,
As if the honest fog blushed black for shame .
The burden of their years scarce noted then ,
What did he get from our famed christianity ?
The fading gleams of their glory flung .
I shall find as able to satiate
To lean in joy upon our father 's knee ;
The trees and orpheus both had followed you . ]
Exceeding number . since that deeply set
' where has gone the yield of cattle ,
But some sweet influence he feels ,
The dark air with odors hung heavy and rich ,
His coward foes chased through forests wide ,
So the two lovers , following her who flies ,
That thy calling came from anger ,
Or as the god more furious urged the chase .
The vine still clings to the mouldering wall ,
Grizzly , ferocious , snapping its sharp tusks : --
That is not paid with moan ;
Among the nations ; but his tidings urged
That ghosts and goblins horrible held nightly revel there .
He quenched all doubt in caesar , and advised --
At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung ,
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
And every night they struck their snowy tents ,
And when my bedtime comes , to pray .
The glory from his gray hairs gone
Is rest where cloudlets slowly creep ,
Resembling , straightway in its place arose .
All night these words were ringing in mine ears !
In balmy sighs commanded me
Heaven bid the soul this mortal frame inspire !
Answered in the words which follow :
Thinking justice might temper the laws .
But the rude wind shall steal its gem ,
Stands the revelation of his love .
Nature gives at thirty-five ;
In such a time , give thanks to god ,
The panting steeds impatient fury breathe ,
Sock it into . -- to administer physical punishment .
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame ,
God took that on him -- i was bid
Then on a stately oak i cast mine eye ,
That burn through your prayers .
Nor lament the year that follows ,
A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came ,
The lusty charioteers their stations take ;
On his pillow , from whence the screaming came .
Summons to rest the weary soul of time .
More pleasure here philanthus took ,
Nor suffers horace more in wrong translations
The purple treasure which she spread ,
The vulture ’s strength was failing fast .
Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters ;
What use you make of these estates of yours .
I oft will recall how you chased away sadness ,
Where the abbey makes us we ;
The weeping mother sends to god her wail ;
Just as we carry on a love affair .
To share the dangers of the sea .
And stocks , and marvel of peru . she flitted
The _ riot act _ the justice reads ,
Truth urges us historians to relate ! ) --
Rather than love , let me be ever lost ,
Was bent to take the vestal vow ,
Neither god nor another , to laugh and see .
But oh ! what art can teach ,
The sin that bereaves thee of mine .
We come to join the feast with you .
Have found them new loves . "
And the angels swing the censers ,
Your writers , who must either draw again
John felt a strange reviving power , that braced
Straightway the travell 'd youth went on
Change lays not her hand upon truth ;
But , when the evening shadows fall ,
Just to feel like those who met
False fugitive ; and to thy speed add wings ,
Clear mirrors , and the passions took their place ,
Now settled heavy , like sickness upon me .
As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon .
A sumptuous ornament . each greecian gave ,
Presumes to stay where nature placed it .
Love 's slow consuming flame .
And fills his chronicle with human woes .
A better soil shall give ye thanks .
And the aged jug led twenty thousand .
From whom these comforts flowed .
And found a woman his defeat had wrought ,
While flashed his eye with joy and pride :
Sunshine of may that will gild every day
And for to make the merry cheer ,
Could rein things in nor hold from sure career
Before the prize is gained .
The souls of happy lovers crowned with blisses
Plunge blades uncounted on the moment drawn .
The glory from the world was gone ,
Which tremble till the moonlight seems to dance ;
His nimble hands ' instinct then taught each string
And apoplexy soon must follow , "
The face with pain was lined ,
And thro ' my illness watched and nursed me .
Unarmed , faced danger with a heart of trust ?
While breathing nature showed how deep it felt ,
Where human hearts beat warm ,
The long , white moonbeams reaching there ,
Its pathway , which the wisest fail to spell ;
Where many roadways meet and spread ,
Earth asks but mud of those that will endure .
A decent share of what those farms would raise .
And the surging waters rinse them .
And bravely dares the danger nature shrinks from .
Cold blew a mouldy wind by me '
Love like a pumpkin holds me in its thrall ;
And gave him gold to maintain his degree ;
To bear unto the stricken solace sweet
And thus in priestly verse the sentence ran :
To each expecting bill applies ;
His rage was such as can not be expressed :
Where bush and tangled creeper lay
Of grim-faced years seize with relentless hands
Thus childhood passed without a care ;
And the alphabet left to rest , that day .
They shall be fed with sorrow at his hand .
That aims for fight his budding brow ;
Will make our love more safe and pure .
Praying for heads long ages laid a-low .
Spotted with stars and smooth with silence sprang ;
It broke away and bleating cried ,
And my heavy burdens lightened . "
A better beauty since the earth was laid
And , as the hermit went ,
Of the inner door that hung on catch
From first to last it tumbling lay ,
Thy flame is a stronghold based as a mountain ;
And yet while france stood doubting if to join ,
Of friendship false , that bright will burn
Melodious murmurs , warbling tune his praise .
Where the sweet sunshine lay dead ;
And again they meet with a crash like thunder ;
They follow in the track of day ,
But when the heart suffers a blow ,
Where hyacinth fingers the grasses bind .
They saw their earthly hope betray 'd ,
An equal spaciousness of bondage find
I think i never saw so great a peace
With just resentment , met them on the main ,
A shudder ran through all the pallid crowds .
And after april , when may follows ,
Must leave some mark of toil behind ,
And took an early seat ; whom follow 'd last
Still to those courts my footsteps turn ,
Which bore was for mannes love ,
Then in racing he 'd beat all competitors hollow ,
Oneself in such matters , i ca n't help believing
Whose sharpness naught reversed .
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road .
Agastya , mighty hermit , pressed
Has dealt their death ; some with dreary faces
With eyes that charm and lips that sing ,
Flowing though the ship has come to rest ,
Coward gods and tricksters that set traps
Of ' pleasure that winces and stings , '
Hush -- hush -- go to sleep ;
On tallyman intrudes twelve hours more ,
And fervent words a passage found .
No sounds of labor reached him from the farms
Into a passionless calm , that wakes and knows
The flame of woe my heart will pierce ,
Hanúmán rested on the height .
My heart keeps time with you today !
Wealth sought and kings adventured life to hold .
At last it takes to weapons such as men
Swells up , and stirs the tumult of unrest .
And nature gives me all her summer confidences .
It gars us a ' in ane unite ,
Gleaming till their fury laughed .
About your head till the dust stops your ear ,
In thee i place my trust ,
And that , whatever homeward winds there blew ,
He felt assured that from this very seed --
Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers :
The breezes fetch along ,
The stars hang thick in the apple tree ,
Except to find escape by knife , or pistol ,
When night descends , embodied on the strand .
" love hath my soul in fetters bound ,
And against this i bear my testimony !
All that heaven to earth allows .
Who know the way that naoise went ?
Her heart went outward with the ship .
Bursting their brazen dungeon , armed with ice ,
Saint gabriel is come from god , and speaks :
The sorrows of his fearful life to share ?
Set on yourself by being nice .
I 'll give thy charlotte thy last farewell ,
And now -- he is lost in glory !
Doth heaven with all its splendors lie ,
Of suffering , silence follows , or through death
And shadowy cross was cast
To fight they went , no jest they meant ,
As blood let out forsakes the heart
Shall of thy days make one perpetual feast ;
Where houses stood and grass did grow ,
Swifter than sight was gone -- even before
There to draw the till of barley ,
Accord the smile of piercing bliss untold .
To lay the deep foundations of our race ,
Such rage as must have seized the soul of cain
That gave me heaven for an hour ;
And what they made , necessity had taught ;
One , bold and hardened with her sinful life ,
And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew ,
His wisest barons , council grave to hold ,
Thereover , swiftly flashed she forth the ring
Through secret paths that reach to heaven ;
And a pale cheek fed with a flickering red ,
So hermes spake , but his advice moved not
Nor will the winds turn traitors at his beck :
He his last shudder gives , and tumbles dead ;
The hour of stern trial has found me :
For he has found that to dispute with us --
Princes , and ye whose delights remain ,
His step has claimed the old-time swing ,
That proud philosophy my precepts taught ?
On ida ’s holy hill he made abode ,
The brook went mad with melody ,
And you stretch out flowers of palest white
The moon 's pale light in softened splendor falls ,
That , more than heaven pursue .
His eloquence rolled like the deluge retiring ,
Let none desire , to guard himself from wrongs ,
And where'er my footsteps wander ,
A silence broken by the guide 's consistent
Gamble hath wisely laid of ut re mi .
To seize each turn of fortune 's wheel ,
Each year sends forth , yet every mother views
Sweet flowers , that she treads on ,
For us let all the rage of torture burn ,
Joys that lie in slumber cold --
From ely and northumberland ; they raise
Honour was wreck 'd , but purity remain 'd .
Let all rest as it stands until the dawn .
Of the revels that they keep .
" o gentle wind , that bloweth south ,
Tho ' health and bloom returned , the delicate chain
How the rebels , beaten and backward pressed ,
Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend ?
Some unknown peak that cleaves unfading skies .
Most willingly them i proffer ;
They cried and swept along to the darkness .
That haunts a star and gives it grace ?
A lotus glory where they tread .
He kneeled and made his prayers to god .
And up this ladder the soul must go ,
And , like fresh eagle , made his hardy flight
And over the tree-tops the clouds slowly follow
Within the space , an olive tree had stood ,
Yet love makes me the poet play .
They do so that affect abstraction here .
Stars rush ; and final ruin fiercely drives
And join the revelry .
They made their way through wood and stone .
Once more found glory in the strife ;
The universe is spread before my face ,
For there the gods find the world again ,
Beauties that the earth hath lost ;
Now follow cheerful to the trembling town ;
Too soon the truth he found !
And to the deadly snare she set
The storm at last brought desolation ,
Silence they seek and darkness ' fell domain ;
And the summer 's strength runs riot .
From house to house the tidings flew :
And poised himself to meet the coming death ,
Now all the tree-tops lay asleep
Till all the earth of peace shall sing .
And your lips can carry a song ;
And for that paid his money down ,
To allied powers whose cause we have embraced ,
Holy waters hither bring , ii . 127 .
Only makes the fool more foolish . "
The voice that issues from thy breast ,
Of hideous night , where fancy strays aghast ;
She , where her terraces arise
The loveliest things that still remain
The doom that songs unborn should sing ,
His jaws uplifting from their fell repast ,
The legion sweeps the way . " _
The sweet and the bitter have passed --
Thorough the fog it came ;
And lifted still at times a rapid glance .
And finds himself at love 's behest
The homeless winds came rushing down --
He is a sun that warms holy heaven ,
It uses lots of strength to beat the air !
Alas , but surely where the hills grow deep ,
Mercy holds the veil to truth .
All heaven in her glorious eyes is spanned ;
As though the lurking thought had follow 'd free .
So told as earthly notion can receave .
Noting the visages of some , who lay
Who am made one with grief ?
At the tenth hour to caliph omar came .
Of sacred wisdom , hid in signs obscure ,
Thy absence from my sight , but to avoid
His revenge thus wrought in safety ,
Then came old jules of the sightless gaze ,
Has topped my intent , and found blemish
Why else that solemn warning given ,
Two thousand years -- much has gone by forever ,
True life in this is shown ,
Which a grove of myrtles made ,
Would share my empire in the shades of night .
And yet no rest has reached that heart .
Afflictions bring us joy in times to come ,
While goodness roves like guilt about the street ,
Both have pass 'd a youth consumed and sad ,
Above all other cities rears her head
That , sounding through three centuries , has led
Ever to come to the end of that life
To take a soul from god on trust ,
Yet freedom , freedom shalt thou find ,
Shall prayers go up , and hymns be sung
That watched the contest . aias darted past
And nightly sleep to balance daily toil . "
That mirror of honour brought to view ;
Dropped down the happy sign it bore .
Bad luck will surely follow !
From his footprints flowed a river ,
Which came , like sunshine , every day ,
Jeremiah 's blood ran cold a frightened
Fly out and follow the flight of the birds ;
Send thou warmth throughout the bathroom ,
Triumphant in his beams , who made the day .
The god 's bright image walks the earth !
Shorn of his noble strength and forced to grind
I that faith inherit .
In what shape came the story to your ear ?
Where sheep and kine are held divine ,
The oak leviathans , whose huge ribs make
Her passionate face went by .
That cold and wayward falsehood made him prove
The sunset lingered in the pale green west :
A day of rain and roaring gutters
In this small seed life hid herself and smiled ;
Where statecraft raised debate .
To lay out fortune 's gifts ; and niccolo
A lightness seemed to raise my feet ,
Though there come a thousand heroes ,
Here by the shrine my place i took
Or europe raised to make proud asia thrall ,
No better cavaliers lay lance in rest ,
Pity and smiles must only yield thee praise .
To join your game of ball . "
If happiness it left behind .
Her lips had brought ,
Loud laughter followed when he rose up sopped .
My heart made , finding failure in its scope .
So that it makes the soul turn unto it .
Hast made thy triumphs mine .
Sweet sounds will rise from the moorland ,
Diaphanous and that radiance mantled through
The murder it commits ; nor that its base
Here giving thanks and oblations ,
Must taste the bitter tonic found in tears .
Runs through thy clenching fingers , and thy gage
It turned a hatchet in his hand .
And omen of our death ! in vain we drew
For him the days go lustreless .
Gracious and soft , lingering upon my book ,
Whose heart kept all through summer time
Love mercy , and delight to save .
The veil which error grasps to hide itself
Divided between carelessness and care .
Where nought is visible can make appear
It aches in loneliness -- is ill at peace
You seemed to float in silent song ,
" yet night is faithful though stars betray ,
In great things , it crushes and stifles ,
Blue , streaked with crystal like a summer day ,
And take the wage of shame .
And joy brings sorrow in her train ;
The undertaking in progression grew ,
Are chas 'd by certainty , and terror turn 'd
From where the hermit 's cottage stood ,
To the heart whose pulses elsewhere measure only
Night came ; the foeman struggled yet ;
Or gives an inch before a vein has bled ,
As clean as ever you see ;
A moment since -- i see i must again --
To battle for the cause of truth and heaven .
Cast on my girls a glance and loving eye ,
Red and gold they lay scattered ,
Has made her anchor fast ,
The hours of darkness passed away .
That often gives despair or cause a gloom ,
The future grasping , by the past obeyed ,
Whose soul-stirring notes dissipated my gloom ,
Could live content in a cup ; "
And spread his arms to meet the waters white ,
Love 's fingers bring me pain .
To india 's lord the haughty regent leads .
And thanks and praises seemed to run
The words that lead unto eternal life .
They lap a dead man 's bleaching bones .
And calls the springing sorrows from her eyes .
And glory shone around .
Where first our marriage-vows were given ,
Be followed by the smiling eye ,
Her buskined virgins traced the dewy lawn .
Within your magic web of hair lies furled
Rises the mist of my pain --
That made him trust alone to merit ;
And , filing through with laughter or with tears ,
To ease the wants of pride and beauty .
Love , love that swiftly coming bared the world ,
But not from the lips that had gone before .
A deep repentance did forthwith succeed
Before she takes to-morrow 's tide ,
Bending as he swept the chords
Life brightly glitters with her gentle smile ;
While life remains that which was thine before
" what progress have thy charges made ?
Care that his sleep ye do not break !
What crime or grievance dost thou see ,
Consider whence the seed of life ye drew ;
Until this storm hath ceased to rave :
The friendship made , which both had sought :
To match his learning and his wit :
The sea which bathed the island 's level shores .
Inciting men , and furies breathing flames :
Once more my whole heart leaps and swells
This makes my spirit low and weak ,
And trusted they would give them due attention .
Thinking of retirement , i heaved an envious sigh ,
The rose that told him so ?
As th ' enchanted water left it ,
How aptly fact to fact replies :
This body , gathering slumber as it goes ,
Love comes and goes as the free wind blows ,
The glorious bow which ráma bore .
Some dark cloud seemed to hang upon the day ;
Tosses and turns , nor ever finds repose ;
To hymn all the fair it shrined ;
From the cold and frost collect them ?
To stir and soften all the time to tears ,
The waves lift up their voice and cry
All that i hold in trust , as unto one
Someone is lonely -- make him welcome here ;
And i must taste the blossoms that unfold
This is the soul that god has given , --
That came to view the royal game .
I hold that he surpasses all the rest
Hugs the brown bough and sighs before it goes .
Old satan pulling fiercely ' gainst
All that your sorrow remembers ,
All things proceed , and up to him return ,
And little birds break out in rippling song !
Sing of the golden season coming .
Each in his longing arms by turns he took ;
Our hearts , whose high affections burn alone
That tends thy early morning .
Who saw the light and followed where it led .
She turn 'd to triumph or to shame
Scholarly and elegant direction suffers no neglect --
The tears to william 's eyes would quickly crowd ;
That the heart can hardly frame ,
Intent his wasted spirits to renew ;
And freely gives the help we crave . ”
Who fosters faith in upright breast ,
And dryades whom the mists have struck
This burthen to the breeze confessed --
Who trod the heavy road of death ,
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of may ,
Now rise in marble , from the roman sway .
Painted in tender grays and whites subdued --
Has held in starry words that i have read .
Or gave your necks to folly 's conquering foot ,
Flieth spain 's pursuing hate .
" yesterday fell in death the noble knight
And feel the dimming touch of age no more .
Took at your hands the rage of civil strife .
Your nature 's essence floating therearound ?
Where always dwells a sabbath calm ,
Sweating the sail , their passionate play and change ,
A threat to all save allan might give pause :
And whenever a dream has come to be ,
With pleasure seen , but boarded at our peril ;
Of sleepy charm whence fragrance streamed ;
And lying on their weariness like balm ,
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
The talons stripped the flesh away .
Such works are held as antiquate and mossy ;
And they whose firm endurance gained
And you bet it makes a difference to him !
Of the sun he loved to follow .
The speedy gleams the darkness swallow 'd ;
Would take its little half-hour 's rest .
Too sorely heavy is the debt they lay
That passed an hour ago .
The darkness is stealing all over the place ,
And sweetly spread thy sloping dales ,
Just distribution made among the greeks ,
His mighty arms , and nearer drew
A wildness rushing suddenly ,
And the forest gives this answer :
Surely , this day , runs warmer
Tall trees their hallowed branches spread ,
But helped to lift the bier .
Of that disease has faced about , and back
Where doom sits poised as satan yawns , --
To bless the turf that wraps their clay ;
To light us to freedom and glory again !
Barred from the world , lest italy they gain ?
It counted not whence sprang
What songless tongueless ghost of sin crept
And they all knew their doom was sealed ;
Nor grizzly vultures , make us once afraid :
Besides , my pathway leads me round
Was ever war with such blest victory crowned !
And turned it to a hissing . his offence
They lie on lowly earth and find it good .
The whole lake rang with rapid skates
While anguish in his bosom wrought .
This kiss upon your fan i press , --
My regiment , could set my wife safe somewhere ,
Was father to the kiss i took ;
And in such love you had their parting seen .
But his sighs changed to sobbing presently ,
And left the western sky to twilight grey ;
Legends of the days departed ,
Those mercyes which thy mary found ,
His father 's footsteps tries to trace
And sustain the assertion by conduct . maurice ,
To take god 's right and rod !
The tumult and the shouting dies --
Clear light of love lies like a veil .
Much more than i relate between us pass 'd :
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw :
With awful mien ; when valiant gama broke
And inch by inch the danger passed .
If want provoked , or madness made them print ,
Our walls can guard what latin hopes remain ,
Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping
For shelter ere the gathering darkness grow ;
This tawny gold ring where the shadows die
't was carried weird upon the wind ,
Cauld blew the bitter-biting north
The rose i well might gather from the thorn :
Beyond creation 's verge is thrown .
Their indigence felt more and more .
Had set his teeth and pray 'd for death ,
Every one to my heart i fold .
She sauntered by the swinging seas ,
There came so loud a calling of the sea ,
The journey of life alone , and nowhere meets
And thumb round thumb went twirling faster ,
Their downcast looks a decent shame confessed ,
Nor can my strength perform what they require ;
Which sin can give to sinless wretchedness ?
Fair stood the wind for france ,
As by the cottonwood it flowed .
The idle law would soon be held in scorn ,
It comes to a place where checking pace
Hath made that place more fair ,
He fills with blossoms of the noblest strife ,
Of burning hate between them , and the woes
There the lake-waters , which in ages gone
" again the fields where wild things run !
And our revenge may rest contented ,
Thy name to a world that another had found !
And a dreadful fight will follow .
Pangs numerous , as the numerous ills that swarm 'd
But still fought on with courage and with care .
Fragrance and passionless music woven as one ;
Yet is my thirst not stanched ;
And thus it fell that , passing nigh ,
And when the time is come -- a merry blast
By favor of allah to perfection sprang .
Equivalent or second ! which compelled
My gazing soul would dwell an hour ,
Softly , as lovers have always come
The bells were silent , not an echo stirred .
The louder winds to music ; soft boughs made
Casts her shadow on the floor .
And mid the brambles of the road has struck
Like giant curses overthrown
Yet in its place a star of beauty lies ;
Which can attack us soon as ever it come .
All other beasts that saw , with like desire
And in the blue-clue throws then ,
As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass ,
Autumn and dead leaves burning in the sharp air ;
Has generally no great crop to spare it , he
Immortal beauty 's fleeting image lies .
Forty times over let michaelmas pass ,
They carry space through time .
Each changing season intimately saith ,
And with his father work us a perpetual peace .
Who blew the breath of life into her frame :
Reproach , not therefore deal thee punishment :
Where first is found the last ward of the city
“ wine gave them courage , and the primal fight
Thirty years have come and gone ,
The rooms have got a woolly smell ,
While from his lips these flowing accents broke :
And roaring billows blue gave birth to thee ,
The blush that 's raised by who talks
And for death ’s last conflict make them ready .
At distance followed : so they came : anon
Lay the monster mishe-nahma ,
To michael thus his humble words addressed .
Their straight black boughs stretched o'er her head ;
For terror coming , sought escape all ways .
And the fierce discord fell . and quietly
His rigorous lady from such fell disdaine .
Till the last fear on us is brought ?
The brands of discord far around were hurled ,
Fresh as if time this moment wound the blast .
They dwell in happy wise .
And these the white sails brought .
Days vanished in the beauty of belief .
But , urgent as the doom that calls
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
Cast royal gifts of rich things on the flame ;
And with thy wit illustrate englands fame ,
" what puts that question in yer head ?
Such presents oft made her ,
Furious the enemy came on like a flood
The frost that keeps her beautiful alway .
That love ordained for man and wife ,
That curls the waves of the levant .
We strayed across the happy hills
This spell thou canst not break .
Hemmed in by mountains blue — lost paradise .
And shake alike the senate and the field .
The snow is gone ,
" of evil can cast down .
Your alchemy has turned more gold to lead
" the news i bring , fair lady , "
For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command ;
In her hands the reel was turning ,
Independence , long claimed as a woman ? her name
So she strove against her weakness ,
Lord godfrey 's eye three times environ goes ,
In pity and mournful awe might stand
To imprint a kiss that lacked not power to spread
Without the house : the very petals lie
That never air or ocean felt the wind ;
After lost battles turn to the sky
And flowers themselves , that sway through sunny hours ,
That had ever nursed a woe .
Finding affection easy to beguile :
Till back went time : once more i stood
To surround a single warrior . "
With mutiny had fired the train ,
More affectionately inclined .
The hours passed by , the stumbling hours and
And the moon discovers that they all have lovers ,
Then the bolster they place athwart his face ,
No knowledge for which words he may not find ,
Puts on the semblance here of sorrowing .
These , virtue ! these the joys they find ,
' to half thy question was an answer brought .
And waiting made his wish outwear ,
Beside them raged the ruthless-hearted fates
Set no man 's land alight --
But the fight over and the victory won ,
Since last i saw those sweet eyes shine ;
That love is a winged thing which flies ;
The empires sail like ships , and many years
Thus fair earth in the spring leads her performances .
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it .
Thou madest with high hope my heart to beat
That has made fat the murderous moth ;
For the lost dream the heart may ache ,
Of bursting seas , chaos on crashing chaos ,
Kings trodden down and scattered senators
Where pardons more than punishments appear ;
Giving each a note of praise ;
Doth human worth mount up ; and so ordains
Tam didna mind the storm a whistle .
Our love came back amain .
And rolled on its harmonious way
And the fanning wind puffed it to flapping flame .
Of scripture hold supreme authority .
Were half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts ,
Which fireflies , flashing through the gloom ,
While its small window left it very dark .
The wind may blaw , the heathen rage ,
That follows after april rain ;
Insults fallen worth , or beauty in distress ,
It sang the song she loved to hear .
Thy mind engage of brave achilles more ?
Invisible pipes giving her feet the tune .
I see how each other they wrong ,
And the sea that rose in the rocks at night
Billows and storms drove hither ; jove commands
Fair heads fresh crowned , and hissed above the speech
" my prayer towards thy heavenly temple came ,
Then sunk the moon , and far away ,
And war employ 'd him , day and night ;
“ strolling , so fame declares , the vigorous clasp
The story told of the ages , writ nor sung
The sun up fair can shine ,
And hear her laughter ringing through the trees .
And naught of earth can we in heart withhold .
And with your laws have made me wife ,
The roseate hue which health unsparing gave ,
The ghost of my lost youth --
And the passports that allowed her to see him
The fainting soul stood ready wing ’d for flight ,
The night is broken eastward ; is it day ,
Where cunning craftsmen fixed them fast ;
Around the shrine itself of fame they stand ,
Or in some funny tale to shine ,
She looked on , and her looks went everywhere .
Is moved by undreamed forces still ;
The chin rose to a mouth he guessed ,
And praising virtues that belong
His early gloom had vanished ; time and space
Reserving , human left from human free .
And seal the eyelids of the weary god .
No other landmark it seeks , nor strays ,
Where the rapt heart with contemplation fills ,
Shall bring me as from death to life
Which made thy blood to flow ;
These thoughts passed through his mind the morning after their
Put into them the vigour which sustains
Where hate and greed he 'd never see .
May give the victory to the novarese ,
And nature 's varied voice is tuned to sing .
After this mac cecht followed the routed foe .
And arthur tramped the past . the loneliness
Whence all my guilt i bring , declare and say
Then , mother dear , thy tears restrain ,
And cold old age came creeping on ?
Waiting to do as does the one that leads .
Avoiding things that brought or strife ,
Grief follows grief and on this woeful day
With a faith that will not fade .
Their love enhanced by sorrows they had shared .
There fits some dread , some heavy , punishment
The smoking tower fell on the scorched grass ,
I am touched again with shades of early sadness ,
In the void aire thy idle voice is spread ,
For ony wife i see .
And will wage a war with pohja ,
Even hope had fled ; and as in parting strife
And fair hopes many as the stars that shine ,
That draught where all things sweet and bitter meet --
Trembled with horror when the summons came
This mighty work to which your souls are set .
I see the easterns weigh their kings ; --
Each noble name they blasted with their breath , --
Whatever can to sight or thought be formed ,
A dryad whom clinging ivy holds while laughs
Long column stretching dark thro ' weeds and moss ,
A party to have made thee by thyself .
With dreadful shouts ulysses pour 'd along ,
Yet , though to fortune lost , here still abide
Through the fog it came ;
He wants her chaste thoughts to be taking away ,
For freeing the heart of sorrow .
To lift the curtain of hope 's hidden light ,
Words like bright javelins to fly with fierce
The eyes of the citizens . i 'll follow thee
The year stands still , the tearing winter winds
So are the heavenly statutes set , and those
That told his virtues far and wide ;
Which should extend thy branches on the ground ,
Not i have made this desolation : few
Led by a mighty impulse , bent his way .
Helpless , forlorn , and sunk in his despair ,
Of heavenly beauty , castianeira bore .
It rose to pelham 's princely bower ,
That bring the frost , the sire of all himself
Viewless ; and underneath a bright sea flowed
But here a small delay forms a great crime :
And the next least word true thomas made ,
Where the pilgrim of nature lay stretched in decay ,
In trembling grief his form he shrouds ,
Will move thy wonder , that nor sex with sex
Where giant boughs hide the sky , --
Now cold if radiant did the wife compare ? }
The day begins to break ,
Which for the boundary of the valley stood ,
Gently stirred the wave baptismal ,
And threats in abundance will work on my fears ,
From every word your lips let fall --
And show the path my captor takes ,
Kind , simple souls that stab and slash and slay
Who comes unbidden , making hearts to mourn .
Who from her fault 's due punishment went free .
The grace cup follows : to the president 's health
The ring that choked her finger ... said farewell .
While their clear bells most lively music make .
And high ere the cold moon quenched the sun ,
So saying , to his assembly back he drew :
The saviour felt its quiet in his soul ;
Where armies lie encamped , come flying , lured
She gives him breath of youth awhile ,
Some earlier god placed in the human heart .
The sun still sees the heather bloom ,
While hope and faith the soul thus fill ,
And my heart it stounds wi ' anguish ,
Far , very far , our knowledge reaches !
This world no sweeter thing than this contains ;
The mountains reeled and pitched into the sea .
You with much anger did such words express :
Chill and harsh the year draws to its close :
But no such winds blow hither ,
Not by the grief that stuns and overwhelms
Night , with the woes that it wore ,
An instinct within it that reaches and towers ,
You must show mercy in the name of god ,
And winter holds the world again .
Weakness and greatness alone ever arrive at this point .
Cauld blew the bitter biting north
All my youth in tears was spent ;
Westward still points the inexorable soul :
And made his beast that better knew it , swerve
Sweet peace doth quietly come on .
Plodded and snuffed the fragrance of the soil ,
And strive to fearless meet death with his dart .
There dwells the peace he hungered for ,
To marry her . what mischief lies concealed
There might i make thee many a song :
These words shall speak your spirits moody :
None comes to her release ;
I skim along through silver smoke ,
This girdle serves to bind it in ;
No farther seek his merits to disclose ,
To take the sacrament with all our men ,
Some voices answer and some notes respond ,
Of those to come in choosing mates .
Forth went shingebis , the diver ,
Have glowed and mellowed in your cheer !
" those creatures are tearing each other to pieces ,
Full on our lord he sets his eye ;
The very word that clenched the spell ,
Flowers fall upon each sleeping face
The piper 's face fell , and he cried ,
The wild wind rang from park and plain ,
To do what they had gladly left undone ,
The quiet ages picked it up ,
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead ,
They had been distanced by new-wedded brides .
Tenderly sad , lost youth mused low ,
Which brought him triumph in the sullan days ,
And the strong current flowing ,
So flashed and fell the brand excalibur :
It softly hangs on many a tongue
But who would settle our carriage bill ? "
Maybe , with wings forever spread ,
All under god , each measured by itself .
Will fall asleep anon .
When i venture to remember it , i quail !
She plies her weary task ,
That honor sends him to the fight ,
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
So that in others pity soon may rise ,
Through that unbounded sea whose billows roll
And when night fell together lay
Into stone had changed their waters .
Through all her length the conflagration ran
Thy blush on every floweret lies .
Hoarce murmur echo 'd to his words applause
Ill keeping the command her lover gave ;
Even the southern breeze blown fresh from pearly seas ,
Through crowd there ran a joyous thrill ,
Forever , life , however spent and clogged ,
And keep me ever steadfast to my purpose .
I know what science this has come to be .
( there they alike in trembling hope repose , )
Night should ease a lover 's sorrow ;
It drives them : hope of rest to solace them
Or suffering spirits urge their plea ,
With other wars my song shall burn ,
Then added , turning to my guide his face ,
And in one great sheaf i bore them along .
The virtues whence his follies grew ;
Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal ,
The robins stand as thick to-day
Here memory mocks the toil of genius . christ
Where faith shall walk with science , unafraid .
Thus addressed the ancient louhi :
He heard the monk 's words rise in prayer .
They bring their own reward :
From founts of hope that never will outrun ,
Where cool delightful breezes played
To every vein his poisoned heart to reach ,
For beauty which has satisfied :
May every joy your lives attend .
Each gallant chief put forth his warlike hand
Out on him rushed -- the day was warm ;
Sent up wails of grief and mourning .
What he design 'd , what mischief might arise ,
And flints unloosen 'd kept their lock --
While the late snow blew from bleak lake erie ,
Like incense curling some cathedral dome ,
Stark staring upon the sward lay the clown ,
While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke .
Lend us thy gift of wings .
What widens within you walt whitman ?
Rose the voice of a stranger arresting the tide :
I thought in vice t ' acquire fame ;
The sun with resting pulses seems to brood ,
Till his ill-gained dollars shall roll away .
Every road goes to the town .
She spreads her wings to meet the sun ,
To catch the weight of pity , meet the stress
And in the midst an elbow , it received ,
Demodocus ! i give thee praise above
True things hereafter will declare it to thee .
My heart , dear heart , is breaking ;
Down lay the wind , and slumbered soon ,
All service ranks the same with god :
Meanwhile , do you find that surprising ?
Though to thee a spring shall rise ,
That meant to combat with old time ,
Across the waste of waters towards him draw ;
Through what dark scenes of bloodshed hast thou passed ,
Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow .
But sweetheart indian summer came
And melts within her hand -- her hand is hot
That kindles them within makes them look red ,
And caught the double sob ,
So sprang the light immediately , nor was
Imperial rule may sway their land ;
And flowers have made confessions unto me
I have reveled in joys that you gave ,
For the man 's hoary anguish draws and presses
The lakes are made a tribute to their spoil ,
There lovely blossoms blow throughout the year ,
The mule-track from saint laurent goes .
Green hill-sides bending to thy shore
What mean these clinging loves that bind to earth ,
He rouseth up himself and makes a pause ;
Sudden thrills through my pulses sent .
And hell 's lost company i saw return
A shudder ran through every vein --
I can but keep my faithful watch and pray .
The limpid water turbidly ran ,
Afar to north and south the echoes flew ;
Still with this he faced the flame ,
Far more magnanimous , than to assume .
Spun high , and a south wind blew .
No hand shall take the other , death .
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven .
Comes a recoil of silence o'er the lands ,
Horses roll in a human hell ;
Thy limbs are racked with the fever-pain .
Of brazen sickle into scorn was turned :
But no cheerful notes came from it ,
Thus showed his ready wit ,
I yield , and leave the loathed fight behind .
They strain and they crack ; and hearts like stone
The golden stars in their orbits turn ,
Aye to pursue whatever give delight .
The bells they made a merry merry ring ,
Fame will fade and crowns will rust .
Take my advice when e'er you find ,
Yet shrinking from true bliss ,
But it makes no odds how hard he may try
Nor read the secret woe which caused his moan ;
Made haste the royal court to reach .
Ah death ! what a weakling art makes thee --
Of beauty that thy hand doth give ;
Out of the forest into which it led ,
For some amang the ashes lay ,
Blue clouds of incense dimmed the vaulted height ;
Here justice holds us prison 'd , hand and foot
For tears no more will fall .
By love and warm desires fed , --
What cordial welcomes greet the guest
The choice we make , or justify it made ;
A craven heart each traitor bears ,
And yellow death lay on his face ;
And sank upon my bosom , murmuring there
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy .
At last it came into his thought
That went before ; in these i shall enrich
Might gather from extravagance .
He could hide the summer through
Old memories come ; old hopes and fears ,
That comes from her old dungeons yawning now
Such mixture was not held a stain :
White , eternal lilies stand ,
When the first red dawn came in .
To pass the night , and kill the day .
Such terror bred that late consumed mass :
For in thy womb rekindling shone the love
For with him i must hold converse . "
I felt thy smile and left results with thee ;
Till you 're from sin set free !
And lead his dances with dishevel 'd hair ,
On every side dire objects meet the sight ,
And closed him fast in prison dark and blind .
Pain heroically borne ,
Despairing perished , finding life a lie . "
Even as out of paradise was driven ,
Old churchyards stuffed with buried crimes ,
Once more , to make you listen properly ,
Love , pouting , took french leave !
He meets the hostile cannon 's blaze ,
For shortly heaven will send thee ease and peace ,
His burial may perform . while thus he swims ,
Or of other than wisdom comes victory here ; -
To make his kind happy as he was himself ,
Whose mighty bow still armed his hand ,
That when it came her hearing almost tore .
When winter comes in earnest to fulfil
His vesture clinging closely round his limbs
Dark grew his face and drooped his brow .
A thousand ages have slowly rolled
And stinted by an empire no more bold .
The gentle lady tuned her eyes away ,
Hold subject lest the grand destruction come .
Teach my sad soul to catch her cadence deep ,
I caught the glory of his robe
And though love can not bind me , love ,
Chaunt in notes that hail reunion ,
Take note of thy departure ? all that breathe
You bring back the happiest spirit from spain ,
As never eye created saw its rising ,
And rosy lips shall tell the tale
Where the ancient tepees clustered ,
They longed to share my lofty rank ,
And ever , if bound here hardest home ,
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
With cheer of clarions blown ,
That grief hath slain me , come . '
To-day , he 'd find them gentle ,
Doubtful meanings we examine together and settle .
Can speed or stay things come to birth ,
A spirit from this place went forth to name him
That follows after prayer .
O if my cherished trees might aid !
As death stood francis drake .
Where love lies cold and dead .
As drawn by steeple witchery .
" others are seen to rise , triumphant ,
My love her life doth prove ;
" and tiptoe joys their hands combine ;
Deep sinks thy smile into my quiet breast ,
Some of the pleasures his money would buy ;
't is love that makes the heavens shine
Might set even death 's cold pulses bounding --
A chattering terror fills the place !
Who gave his parents no just cause for fretting --
No nerve twitched in my face , although i felt
Answered in the words which follow :
His soul had seen a vision while he slept ;
That feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks
How the last subtle coil slips round your throat
He passed into the future with a smile --
To where the monastery stood .
The gay wind in the foliage makes ,
To charm his fancy , or his heart engage .
He drew not nigh unheard , the angel bright ,
Will shine on my completed rite .
His sire and lineage to disclose :
Of thronging multitudes the shore rebounds :
The birthright that no sovereign can restore ;
They stand a line of vestals pure ,
Time calls you now ; the precious hour employ :
Perhaps the victory shall not come to me ,
By ye will stand of norway land
So hung the war in balance , as the scales
In their fury , rolling , roaring ,
Can break out thus , think happiness !
One great law controls their being , --
On a wide meadow , which without it lay .
And arthur rowed across and took it -- rich
Feels not the wants that pinch the poor ,
Suddenly all that gloom is gone :
They see those happier ghosts that waned away --
On all who saw came a mighty fear .
Onward through life he goes ;
The columns of the rain went by ;
Nor honor here worth striving for alone .
As the fair path that bliss secured
Then all the gods their answer made :
The rafters shook with cheers ,
The saint vaśishṭha gave assent ,
Flew , and was lost in prayer .
So that thine enemies deal not the blow .
And a shout went round the board ,
And can he leave this heart to break ,
And his grave has got no name .
On thee my pity may be shown .
All these divine philosophy explores ,
The mind contains a world within its frame
The legend of an angel told ,
The snow fell hissing in the brine ,
Visions of the years gone by
Yes , i have found myself in close acquaintance with
Worn empires fill with knaves ?
There came to me in dreams a stammering woman ,
Triumphal pæons shake the air !
The thongs that held me to my brothers ,
A panther 's skin across his shoulders flung ,
The knight has caught the nightingale ,
And i , the weight of woe removing ,
Dice charged with fates beyond their ken ,
And stained are the banners that float above us .
And , in the love and tenderness i bear
So fair a bloom from vanquished winter won .
The unsettled mind its ancient seat regained ;
Of woven fear , distrust and subtle pain ,
Lo , the blazing wheels go by !
Above a bay where fish-boats lay
Nor can past years come back again .
The shadow 's finger points the dismal hour !
With such consort as they keep
And shaped in squadron-strophes their desire
My heart went muffled like a bird that tries
Till the wood behind seemed risen from root ,
" and blinking stars at night that rose and set
I took her dainty eyes as well ;
A joy that enters eternity ! "
The drops that war had sprinkled there .
The talisman with leathern circlet stayed ,
And take due vengeance of celano 's kind .
Gives thee to make thy neighbour 's blessing thine .
Some clustered graves where half our memories lie ;
Draws out the sweetened name of death .
My curse upon thy soul shall press
While over-desolate my heart called out
And luxury of power i seemed to see
If thou the truth wouldst teach ;
Follows the prayer , the readin ' next ,
Then scotland drew the sword ,
From which arises music a hundredfold .
To catch the coming flame in turn ; --
Or shape my thoughts into words with my tongue .
And you 'll find him ever cheerful ,
To shape his life -- if he should live ,
And the eye travels down to oxford 's towers .
His patriotism perished .
" but one , " the captain made reply ,
Still let the poet 's strain be heard ,
Having a heart love thrilled , and sorrow wrung ,
Hence too it comes that nature all dissolves
Who had prepared for her so fell a doom ;
Which urged life 's wave for thee !
Who seek their pleasures in the boast of might ;
Would show the world her vainest trait , --
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . "
Cold , and very cold you 'd get ,
Till god 's own smile came out :
And i blushed for the world we 'd made ,
The understanding meantime suggests , the analogy of experience
Love sought him first -- at dawn of morn
Might raise musaeus from his bower ;
And other wonders cities bring to pass ;
From which distilling fell the lukewarm blood ,
It moved and moved , and took at last
Your dear remembrance will i keep in mind ,
To me whose joy is drowned in tears ,
Unheard , unseen , three years her arts prevail ;
And shouts arise from left and right ,
What never tongue or numbers told ?
Some sweet thieves have made off with our fun !
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow ,
The lids , that on her eyeballs lay ,
Oaths peel like the hammer of thor --
Him the frolic loves have found ,
Even there we plant these banners and this cross ,
And ere the morning bring the light .
Plato 's elysium , leaped into the sea ,
From whose branches trailed the mosses ,
Night brought relief to my sad , aching brain .
My love has come home ,
Blood of men guiltless was shed ,
Through you , wed the thought and felt .
Leaving her hollow cold , forsaken .
Then a single cloud rose up in the west ,
For now he knows his lovely dream hath passed ;
The very fire that from it came
She sank , abandon 'd to the wildest woe .
Is lying massacred and sunk in slime !
They canna sit for anger .
The wildest massacres were kept from him .
Strikes fearless at all evil that it knows .
Of blossomed branches , drifts into her ears .
A monster fierce they 're drawing on ;
As breezes wake and play .
And straightway went upstairs .
Go back as far as sums 'll carry .
This first line let me weigh completely ,
The pledge was taken , the arms laid by ,
For heathen heart that puts her trust
O madly the sea pushes upon the land ,
I feel a music which comes straight from heaven ,
So all my spirit fills
The hours of daylight come and go ,
That this new faith hath founded ?
Six weeks or more a letter came from her ,
Cold its pulse lies ,
And sheds his addling tears of woe .
Not all the gifts that wealth can bring ,
It shows me only darkness .
And when all 's spent that life has given ,
Thus each is drawn along by some peculiar joy .
So this delusion grows from bad to worse
A heavy tide of blood swept over
't is passing wonderful that they ,
Take thou no joy in any passing dream
Where mighty towns in ruins spread the plain ,
Giving their impatience vent ,
And the bathroom set in order ,
Weareth that form , which influence of the soul
Destruction on the people brings :
To lead a spotless life amid temptations ,
Or the steep walls obstructed , round them cast
She would have sunk all blushes on my breast ;
The sky with burning towns flared red ,
It takes my soul with loveliness .
No answer came to graham lee .
Then when it worked for the birth of a star
Joys that _ he _ hath reaped and garnered
All it knows
Girt out the world . the forest lay
Forth he drew , with solemn manner ,
That lies upon the trojan chariot-lords .
Are hither come together , as you see . "
And stirring bagpipes thrilling forth ;
Who gave him rude dismission ; he in wrath
Pale as a lilly pine her self away ?
Joy follows on sorrow like sunshine on rain .
This court , considering the premises ,
Angry grew and sighed for vengeance ,
These teach us patience , we confess ,
Slaying his son , and filling me with woe .
There fall no tears like theirs that all men hear
That hung over mountains and tree ,
If i was feelin ' blue or sad .
Little of april 's anger thought .
Till i dreamed , as his music made me ,
Struggling souls by thee are strengthened ,
You furnish your parts toward eternity ,
Then up she took her little crook ,
Track my feet going in the ways of them .
With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk .
My crimes lie heavy on my heart .
For dissolution wrought by sin , that first
Where flowery wreathes , and twining ivy blend .
The golden thread of courage is n't linked to
So we made for the bold mounseer .
While earth sits ebon in her gloom ,
Its sun shall never more go down ,
Give heaven the credit of a deed
He wrapped himself in sweet poetic thought .
And yet the beauty gave no answer !
Of my boundless sea of hopes , that glittered bright
Grief wastes my life , and makes it misery ;
Their biscuits took and , nothing loth ,
As for the service you will find
Yet the sun will wade in waves of gold ,
Subject , compound them , follow her and god .
Nor long will his love stay behind him .
A spy has discovered a very ' cute dodge .
And there shall the baby go .
What wrongs are borne , what deeds are done
The only throbs she gives ,
Bid cease the battle . bid both armies sit .
From my aching heart she stole .
A dream of mine flew over the mead
The walls of her , cumber her pleasant ways
So to turn back from war achilles awed
Still no word came from afar .
The lark to meet the sun ! )
We seek a gate that leads to life immortal ,
Only the stars give warmth to it ,
Where paphia 's arms have hung in joy .
Just to make living sweet and whole ,
We shall a youthful race prepare ;
Great pouches swing beneath his eyes .
And his faith grew in a hard ground
" revealed on earth by music . planets move
About this spring , if ancient fame say true ,
When we for hopes of honour lose
The soul came to him of his hapless friend ,
Whose pining visions dim , forbidden hopes profound ,
A backward look over his shoulder he cast .
The love where death has set his seal
But being crossed , vindictive , cruel , cold .
And still the cypress-arbor showed
With warmth gives sentence , yet is always just :
Leading to salvation 's wells
Who can within earth 's arms lay the mad sea
Nor reckon small things duties small ,
As with joyous bound , to their mystic sound ,
Will load me with a coward 's shame --
With living stars that chased the gloom .
No farther seek his merits to disclose ,
Whose height misplaced may pierce me like a shame ,
Swifter far is than feet can go ,
In my heart there comes a vision ,
Leave thy day-dreams to thy sister ,
To wail until the night is sped .
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east ;
It seemed that time had passed on otherwhere ,
And in their tortured eyes i stand forgiven .
“ since nature could such heinous deeds permit ;
And made my spirit free .
Tortoise ! whereon earth hath stood ;
And there in deathlike slumber fell .
There came a crowder to the mermaid inn ,
In candid arts to play the critic well .
Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things ,
Contrite i see the folly of the past ,
The nature she took from her god .
Shall catch communion with the past
Whose gray boughs shivered with excess of awe , --
Scatter thy life as the summer 's shower pouring ;
And in the winter keeps you warm ,
Spake the wizard , words as follow :
And to a happier land wafts merrily away !
They could not have brought them better news .
To find my good game so belittled .
We wove the roses round her brow --
Set the clouds on fire with redness ,
The bobolinks fill the fields of light
There is no law to hold
Who hath made the universe .
They reckon pretty rough .
Afflictions sent , dire evils to remove .
Those who find contemplation in the urn ,
Or must pain and sickness make sweet home forlorn ?
For thee the heedless world will give no place .
But a sea of sunlight flowed ,
Hot raged the quarrel ; then came justice in ,
As thoughts of his sweet childhood rose
On which the soft horizon melted down ,
Where wisdom we surprise with shame-dyed lip ,
From ruin-wreaking strife forebore the hosts ;
And makes the reign of sorrow brief ;
When first they feel , with secret pain ,
Which i took for a purse .
To fix the fleeting gaze of centuries !
Were brought low by that swift avenging host
“ blushing she felt it , and her timid eyes
Where silver lakes with verdant shadows crowned . ]
That give but emptiness they served to hide .
Shall come dishonor 's stain .
Crumbled , what only its hands can make --
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss ;
A song can borrow when the bosom throbs
Were one his soul it had not found on high
Then mingling with the falling waters came
Gold unto the mass he added ,
And take the balmy air .
Southward they set their faces . the birds made
And chastened limbs ride round athena 's shrine
' both with one price were weighed ,
But time and toil have marked my face ,
To feed his furnace fires , nor cares
What hope was left for you ? for you ,
Large sums they raise to help the suffering poor ,
When life , and you , went by .
My heart to speechless thankfulness composed .
All wears the ashy hue of agony .
Yet felt my spirit at that word refresh 'd ,
" or , to quiet the fever i feel ,
Of persian hearts or turn its way ?
And those who dwell where pleasing augia stands ,
Old poets have sung , and old chronicles tell ,
The lily-fingered spring came o'er the hills
Deal gently with the leaves that lie before thee !
The ship that is waiting for me !
Drank on , and care gave to the wind :
Sense-bearing motions . hence it comes that we
Bringing calamity to seafarers ;
Whom physic , i find , always makes melancholy ,
While the lay with mighty wing-beats swept
To break a jest , when pity would inspire
Till the tears run through thy fingers sweet ?
But pass for theirs who had the luck to light
Each helm made sure by the twilight star ,
And through my heart a flood is hurled
Yet the rose has one powerful virtue to boast ,
Thy sun in morning splendor mounts the sky ;
Such health do my fountains bestow ;
With pale or ruddy flame ; the smoke ascends
The giants who the rites would stay .
So anciently grayly white it stood ,
War is the arbiter of rising worlds ;
He sought his absent love and grieved .
And night draws near , the sadly sweet --
And seem already to retrieve the day .
Sore shook the grove ; cold horror seized
In fairest light , each borrow 'd grace ,
Were shining in those awful eyes !
The fairy clocks strike their inaudible hour
But night sits monarch yet in the mid sky .
This side the middle met us ; while they strode
Of noble hercules , by pallas raised
The stars already near to bring the time ,
And from their hearts take every thought of hate ;
The prudent greek ) possess the royal mind .
And all the nine with all their warmth inspire ;
But fix thy better hopes on scenes above .
So harsh it jarred , so loud it lied .
He then the moral-mending cat applied ,
The full moon in the end begins to wane .
He felt that lucile penetrated and prized
That in my presence offers such a wrong .
Down the dusk hills the maenads fare ;
That in the heaven appears was there diffused .
In childhood 's scenes resolved to seek relief :
But half can tell love 's feeling ;
Thick fell the snow upon st. george ’s day ;
And thank the morning for the light it brings ,
On other brows th ' immortal rays shall shine :
Upon himself the monster brought
Because their pain spreads neither right nor left ,
And burn with hate of tyranny and wrong .
This deed the burtons made to captain kingston --
And through the lonely night sweeps their refrain
" her " dreaming fingers lay between the tunes ,
With guilty fears the pale assembly shook .
My love went by , as long ago ;
His arrows and the fight maintained .
And yield a pleasure better than gold .
From all sides to her ears there came
And loud as missile from an engine sped ,
The corn was springing fresh and green ,
A thousand delicate fibres reaching out
From founts of hope that never will outrun ,
And slight withal may be the things which bring
But an angel fell in love wi ' her ,
While the first whiteness into wings unfolded ;
To lead me from its solitude .
Begins to gnaw itself with selfish craving ;
And when the black bat slants its wing ,
I doubted if it came from any marshy reed
The nightingales made vocal
Did my conductor draw me , saying : " ask
A sigh that piercing mortifies ,
And freedom 's spring is coming .
In fields where roses fade .
Thy hated name is tossed once more in scorn
The author made almost no attempt to arrange the material
Have fallen by his wicked art ,
And , hurried on by blind and furious mood ,
And lips whereon his lips can lie ,
A raid that came to stay ;
All day the gusty north wind bore
Grows green and broad , and takes no care ,
The shapes of women swayed in ebon skies ,
Despair and wonder spent their passionate store
And golden light shall touch each sacred tomb ,
A weary wight from populonia 's portal went ;
On reeled the battle 's trampling mass ,
Whose art was nature , and whose pictures thought ;
Each seeks employ , and each a different way :
All with rosy fragrance teeming ,
Appointed , which declares his dignitie ,
Turns fell hyena of the ghoulish race ?
Upon the wanton breezes . strew the deck
And weird harmonies they warble
This fond memorial to his talents raise .
And straight with double force the stroke repaid .
Daily its tides of briny freshness leads .
Beauties that the earth hath lost ;
Hands of steel can deal hard blows ,
As though the sun his glorious state should leave ,
Sorrow 's pale hand keeps the key ;
Where the twinklin ' fireflies shine ,
The riches that i held so close and dear .
Before the ice would bear ;
How the old portraits take you back
The spring was coldly wrapped in sullen haze ;
The following verses refer under their dark imagery to the
From sudden hands of boughs that lay
That makes amends for all the wintry past .
Nor follow star-directed ways , nor tread
It asked a crumb of me .
Though dawning morn should only show
Peace is our portion . yet a whisper rose ,
To pressing views , my wishes tend .
Around his eyelids and his senses pour .
Which draws a monstrous picture of mankind ,
And then , with sudden qualm possessed ,
And from distant waters brought it ,
Like the joy that flows from peace ,
White orange blossoms fill the boughs
Jumps into the lists , nor seeks to linger ,
A murmur makes among the boughs and leaves .
Is soften 'd by thy saintly smile ,
No other heart than thine can give ;
Its stamp i 've power to show ;
In pity of my grief it seems to fail .
Yet some who led this mad revolt i hold ,
" with thoughts that ever range above the skies ;
Dawn 's million-colored fountain might spring .
When her heart misses one lamented guest ,
And in our home the magic mirror shines
Its music , lest it should not find
Evil words they heaped upon me ,
Which first love traced ;
" the scattered clouds fly cross the heaven ,
Cemented by philosophy serene ,
The clear white moon sails through the skies
I think far better than he makes a match .
While cigarettes to ashes turn .
How swift its moments fly .
Something about the calling made them start .
I heard the voice arising demanding bards ,
In motive e'er is found the sin ;
But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
Scatter the living coals of truth !
The shout of rapture ere it burst abroad ,
So finding gain in threatened loss , his mind
Where the spine joins it . not more furiously
And there make me a full fair grave
To form this empire gigantic
Music hath called them , dreaming ,
To follow gods that have no power
And knowledge in our own land make her free ,
Take note of thy departure ? all that breathe
Of clubs formed by women to rescue the nation
As pure thy limpid waters run ;
To labour as her lord and master drew .
The tree of life stood , while through the land
Oppression 's iron reign to bear ;
But i felt the flame of their hot desire .
Nor without the helm to guide them . "
How all our copper had gone for his service !
But did leave a fortune in people who knew
Once a week he comes and stands ,
Swishing through the woodlands where the brown leaves lie ;
And merion next , the impulsive fury found ;
That threatens me for claiming what is mine !
More it displeases god ; and so stand lowest
Such force resist , but the huge weapon drove
To which so oft her fancy went
( with which i do not stain my tale )
Love lit a beacon in thine eyes ,
As if all nature went to wreck !
And , when stillness holds troubled sway ,
He 'd sparked it with full twenty gals ,
She only brought us calm repose .
With damp and darkness seemed to strive ,
And to their feet the congregation bounded .
We 'll keep the chorus going ! "
Soft pity to infuse :
And minion 's pride withstand ;
From which no care can save ,
They 'll pay no attention to your tears .
He did n't care what pain it gave him .
Have took thy folded songs on trust ,
By which thou art encircled , i have cast
Like varying winds , by other passions tossed ,
The golden spear went through the pagan 's heart
Down his throat you might happen to slip .
And yet his presence fascinates and fills me
To execute the vengeance of its wrath .
See the hideous forms which thy spirit shall chase ,
Nursing her blind desires , which knew not rest
Tho ' pain flares its fires in my breast .
How long do you think our love can last ?
The plume of smoke would show
Her kindness then but fed the fire of greed
That hung and swung ' mid fruits and flowers ,
The fountain seal 'd , yet life found way .
And straightway came old scorn and bitterness ,
And with a twang her flashing wit descends .
That fills with light our stormy sky .
Him that brings thee countless treasures ,
We strayed through furrow and corn and grass
Fled " where the roses go " :
They make their way -- for where art thou !
Whom fate from lowly cures calls to bear
Faint , and more faint the howling echoes die ,
Her faith to me she nobly held
Hast lost thy ready skill of tongue and pen ?
" to thy priests ' commands give ear !
Clear eyelids lifted toward the north and south ,
No more should light adoring eyes to thee ,
For property stripped off by cruel chance ;
And wake the sun that lies too long .
His children four the seasons flew .
Were full enough to stand such friendly offers .
Take the advantage both of arms and fight .
Indulge me , nor conceive i drop my theme :
I view the constellations quietly , quietly burning ;
Give rapture , mighty king , to us .
Feels the dread stillness round him as it chills
Take part and put the boxers down , lay hands
And through the void air sang
Its perfect stature stands at last confessed !
And with the proud in spirit , destruction lies :
The moony vapour rolling round the king ,
Money goes -- he knows .
But even friends security should hold :
My dreams would grow supremely new and whole .
A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest .
To follow nature , and regard his end ;
Who , lost in strange and sorrowful surprise ,
Far other aims his heart had learned to prize ,
" and priam 's town in ashes lay .
Like shadows round a radiant child .
The book of records read , the chronicles ,
The pure flame spreading high and low .
From my lips would flow
My dead self rises from its tomb .
The kind magician might to us convey ,
Look thou my steps pursue : the margins give
Of waves that fall in onset or that strive .
Unbroken glory , a gathered radiance ,
I gave the boons kaikeyí craved ,
And make high prayer to the great spirit
Follow a shadow , it still flies you ;
Mars the perfect plan that its master meant .
Due thanks are given in a proper song .
Is what her eyes have told the silences
The great hierarchal standard was to move ;
Still holds us spelled with potent sorcery .
It has lasted days , but minute and hour
All the wonder that his soul received ;
Give me the old clue to follow ,
This soften and refine the soul for heaven .
Who turned a piteous face to him
And passion ply the sail and oar .
I wonder where it comes from ; sea birds cry
Which he made glorious , till the nations rung
" i feel that i need some air ,
Nor with those smiling dangers play ,
Had taught the trampled heart to feel ,
To ease the people 's woe . "
There lay three shepherds tending their sheep :
Dark broodings turn to find their lonely lair ;
Had guilt to stain thy spotless innocence ?
No signs of sadness came .
That in winter you come to distress ? "
Rich joy and love he got and gave ;
Thy wrath were better spent !
A master passed in mastership ,
And he tossed his locks of blackness .
Who is it comes to comfort you ?
Her garden 's histories tell of to all near .
Thou and thy children are consumed by me !
That strew the mourning skies ;
He drove his foemen forth .
Have lighted up and led his age ,
And steal myself from life by slow decays !
Sweet all the joys that crowd the household nook ,
But , hark ! there comes a song ,
That i might hold their charms in my embrace ,
No glamour fills her such as ' wildering lies
Then added , turning to my guide his face ,
And cool its pain , o sea !
In charity set free ,
The west-wind finds its way :
There breathed the fairest blooms of spring ;
That feeds on steel and bullet , he that can
Or else what rapture it would yield ,
It blew the stars as clear 's could be ,
Which has gone farther with the soul of man
Than the threads that softly shine
Deeper grew the coming woe and fear ,
For you alone to happy end must bring
And soon , by realms of rushing gloom ,
As only care like mine could have produced .
Can reach the heart of his great loneliness !
So duty urged that hour to seize ,
Even tho ' the shade of sadness catches ! --
My love with him doth still abide ;
Who followed late the sly enticing maid ,
And he gives me quite a headache ? "
O lips that mine have grown into
His loving thoughts to sítá flew .
Some take a gloss of happiness
My lips are locked -- i lean and cling ,
Unfruitful darnel and wild oats have sway .
These make a true religiousness of act .
Eager they grasp the gifts which culture yields ,
The hostile banners blaze against the sky
And thereby made me pity him the more . "
Earth 's yawning caves their depths reveal ;
Are weakened in our trust in thee ,
Her secret love disguised in clothes of hate :
And rests on others ' fame :
While , as thy song rang pure and clear
Their deepening shadows throw ;
And all the sweet buttermilk watered the plain .
With none to give us aid .
Which made thee all that nature meant thee .
I 'll meet the raging of the skies ,
Has long enough been served by creeping things ,
That liberty shall never die .
Sweet laurel with fresh rose its force shall try ;
No grief or loss our lips may ever tell !
It came so slow , so wearily ,
But being spent , the worse and worst
The other form of fraud makes nullity
Feed the heart of the night with fire .
Within the flames ' wild fury passed .
It spoke of those vast labours , incomplete ,
Whose grave could not give him rest ;
To pierce the shield of error through .
For tears to shed , and songs to sing ,
The hymn for morning rites ordained ;
The cloud that flitted o'er the saintly brow
The undying spirit , setting forth from me ,
A heaven-born glory permeating all .
The pricking of a vein to make the heart
But , o ! fell death 's untimely frost ,
Till bedtime too speedily comes !
The mastiff in a slumber fell ,
A fair cathedral , too , the story goes ,
Benign , of calm maturity , she stands
And feel that the spirit forever has fled ;
And armed with mighty power , obtained
A head that held an europe half devoured
Her fame to keep , her fame to recover .
Our intellect is to such depth absorb 'd ,
Although to justice that did first belong ,
The collection begins with two aboriginal songs . these
And came across the senses , like to sips
And more than a hundred spirits sat within .
Will chase mine every grief away .
And the light fell on his hand ,
For such the law that lives for aye . ”
But hush ! for the silent glory is stirred ,
And in the song it mingled . and the dame
And soft lights streamed upon her ;
And the tyrant ’s rage confront ,
And some content to serve and follow and fight
There are two veils of language , hid beneath
But this thought brought with it no fear .
Nor cared that beauty stood in mutual eyes ;
And in words like these expressed him :
Make way then -- life , rejoicing ,
" woe is me , my old life fated !
Here memory mocks the toil of genius . christ
Affronting witches incense burn ;
That had survived the father , served the son .
And the warm purple circled on the tide .
That all a face of burning crimson wore .
And gave the carven rod and guiding bands
And its ruts flow deep with tears
Or raising a laugh with a flash of filthy wit
Will you give me the music of heaven ,
And fair with sculptured stories it was wrought ,
One of those comedies in which you see ,
Which are love 's words , in us mean more
The pages looked blank as they stood in column ;
Answer in the words which follow :
Devout archangels should the name enjoy ,
As though some wondrous hidden thing it knew .
While discord , sinking , veils her ghastly head .
" for ever wilt thou heave the bursting sigh ?
An empire , fashioned by the sword
Where in the spring the swallows came to build .
A dreary moan floats on the wind
And to repentance and confession turn 'd ;
Hearts fearful beat , and consciences feel sore .
And sorrow dig its grave within my heart .
You looked in mine , the music rose and fell
Themselves but shadows , into shadows go ;
Cloud and wind may shift and veer :
Of hopes unto sorrow given ,
My spirit longs to reach the strand
Her destiny should come that way .
Sweetheart , where all the dancing joys compete
Your name falls emptily upon my heart .
The clouds are broken in the sky ,
The trees aspire to heaven , like flame ;
Dying in sand while the tide flows back ,
That war had burned along the unhappy land ,
The cur off with the tidings ran ,
Whene'er he bears a sovereign 's sway ;
If wealth be told in terms of happiness .
Their flesh was sinew knit to bone ,
Yet folly so long has directed their course ;
And cast to earth some glorious flag .
For these thoughts that rise above ,
Can beat his shadder , mighty near !
Quickly sets his bath in order .
Where beauty learned what wisdom taught .
By her maternal strength and instinct gave .
How roses first came red , and lilies white .
And she calls for a toast to the ghastly ghost
Once more the palace set in fair array ,
Thou muse of music , take my thanks ,
From whose branches trailed the mosses ,
Nor all that prattling rumour says ,
I felt that joy would on their path attend .
Grey smoke was shaken , which the faint spring breeze
Look how the yellow clearness , streamed across ,
Through all the compass of the notes it ran ,
And at every drifting cloud that went
Of juno 's eye had been the council held
He saw sad sufferers relieving pain ,
The vast and helpless city while it sleeps .
On bosoms zoned with pain --
As old time makes these decay ,
The space his arm can cover with the lance ;
Some bearded meteor , trailing light ,
As , when his conquering foot he raised ,
Amid the fierce glare beating down ,
And loud the watchman blew his trump ,
To take revenge on his condemned head :
The stillness bred spectral fear
She only knew the dullness sorrow brings .
I tried to think of some excuse to make ,
Whether hope rose at once in all the blood ,
And gave to each in turn a vile caress .
They have won a good prosperity ;
Like some good ghost , and went the same ;
Had he ne'er sought that fatal view ;
I tie the shadows safe from gliding back ,
Which flashed across her lip serene ,
Pressing hands and whispering passion ,
So that my heart failed , daunted by that glimpse
For when of my lost lady came the word ,
This marriage of pilgrims that followed the sun !
Seasons may roll ,
Which made me no less eager to turn round ;
Over three faces a sad smile flew ,
Of those , who load them with committed sin .
Is hammered into fact made strangely plain .
My great travail so gladly spent ,
Across the vacant day-blue dimly trailing !
Dead are the lips where love laughed or sang ,
Chill as a dull face frowning on a song .
God send ye joy and peace on earth ,
And at every drifting cloud that went
Still what a royal aspect he retains !
Stern truth takes flesh in shows of lovely feature .
Of that strong soul now ranked with god 's elect
Take nature 's path , and mad opinions leave ;
Not a butterfly blown from the hills of green ,
Whom with all love men seek to please .
From earth afar arose a cry of pain ,
Contemplating , through all the churches went ;
By athene 's spirit moved .
Then thus , with grief and anger moved ,
Are mortals urged , through sacred lust of praise !
And thus in haughty words expressed
Like sleep , yielding to dream 's caresses .
By whom a friend is made to die ;
The mend will hold until you reach a wright .
The maid ( and thereby hangs a tale )
Due to their wickedness have , therefore , found .
There did i leave abundant store of wealth ,
Of nationalism ; you could throw
The morning comes ere darkness goes .
The tresses leave its brow .
So hatred from my bosom would have chased ,
To where the body sits , and learn ,
And the blue wastes flowed with honey ,
On lands of morn may lie ,
Their words must stay unsaid ,
Though o'er our roofs the thunder clouds combine ,
Ere night descends i shall more surely know
Now with fidelity displayed the clear
In full perfection all thy works are wrought ,
Following down the path the sunrise took .
By high education brought pressure to bear .
Then shall i see each loss a hidden gain ,
Of harmony , in tones and numbers hit
Their flapping wings tirelessly beat and throb .
For well they now can spare their wings ,
" around the town three battles beat ,
We 'll raise the song on highest key ,
In ev'ry hour that passes , o.
Or have we left our marksmanship at home ?
The sleepless arrow of zeus flew straight at him ,
What go ye into the wilderness to see ? "
With colour as of fire , she made response :
And gave due honors to his father 's tomb .
The waves to sleep had gone ;
And drank from the scenery of beauty but sorrow ,
As in us when the news was dealt
A promise asked and given warm from the heart ,
It speaks with such authority ,
That will take him to his slumber ,
Which dying , tenfold terror gives to death ,
She sprang upon the mountain 's dangerous side ,
Pace round the piles ; three times they ride around
Ere pain come in turn .
Slowly the sea went down as the wind fell .
So that his deeds may be made manifest ,
Things truly venerable , hither came
Live and take comfort . thou hast left behind
Its aspect reflected from the eyes of beatrice .
And thro ' my illness watched and nursed me .
And let her dowry in thy wain be laid ,
From whom the answer came unto these words ,
And mend the blunders pride or folly makes ?
Who , when this small republic rose ,
And has stamped signs of this upon the foe .
The kindly thoughts that rise ;
Here from the trees the gum all fragrance swells ,
Too young to feel that i was young ,
To settle her annuity .
In wealth and multitude , factious they grow ;
Where twenty ages gather o'er a name ,
Happy were the days we spent together !
They feel as if their home were heaven ,
Wind and unwind their dances when the light grows cool
And tell what came of dora and her lover ,
In peace a whole long year has flowed away ,
Which his own hard work had bared .
Is made smooth by the calm ;
Trailing your sweet fingers through .
And its eerie voice comes piercingly ,
Where heart-blood beat or hearth-smoke curled
With one wing gone , in most dejected state
And called my willing soul away ,
Its firs , and afar rose the peaks
What shall your desolate nations rise and say ?
The sombre organ prayed .
To feed his hate with bitter food ,
His gaping wounds the fall set open wide ,
It shows , although i ’m hoary
But friendship 's voice shall ever find
His eager mind reached for it and took hold .
From the ocean came the west-wind ,
Which bade her soul rejoice .
Atrides , trembling , casts his eye below ,
And harvest-fields , its mystic splendor rests !
The sunset lit a fire of drift and sat
And sinless maids draw near
I gazed . on a sudden my strange seizure came
Bewailing thir excess , all terror hide .
Whose voices make the emptiness of light
But down the radiant fillet ran along ,
Till join 'd the mohawk , in their course
No path shall lie too deep in forest gloam
He doth feel the sorrow too .
Whose beating heat filled the red heart with mirth ,
And i have winged it with desire ,
And find a cordial in my brethren here .
Must follow my first swift embrace of you .
If bleak and barren scotia 's hills arise ;
My mary keeps the heart i gave ,
And make them tremble at my martial law .
Where no disease reigns , or infection comes
That bears a myriad candles all alight ,
And in your joyous errand reach the spot
Or from the dark recesses where they lie ,
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of may ,
To relate a wondrous tale .
Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate --
And view the ocean leaning on the sky .
And the fathers and mothers had been given their freedom
As thin blue clouds the mountain summits rise ,
My pent-up tears oppress my brain ,
The foe still surged on every side ,
That the bugler yonder prepares to sound ;
And cool its pulse of fire beneath
And streams released from winter 's chain ,
Save to love your heart gives heed ,
And where will your equality be found ?
But above me i feel the rushing ,
As brief a while as may a friendship live
Explored the ancient world , to chain the new ;
Steel them with judgment , darken them with blame ;
And give so good a price that all may live
Where galileo stood at nights to take
Not yet the sword has found its sheath ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain . "
His reversed face may show distaste ,
The headlong coursers spurn his empty car ;
And a bold semblance through their host put on
The white hands bring the poison and the cord ;
Go on , thou troubled memory , wander on !
By the gurgling river that plashes and plays ,
Lips to sing and feet to follow ,
In nice gradations does the chain arise ;
To me he made reply :
It leadeth not by pastures green ,
But we left him alone with his glory .
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
Bright lightnings ; hector glares revenge , with rage
His garments only a slight murmur made ;
Are not able to bear these with grace ,
While january , when half its course was run ,
A thousand blows come from the archbishop 's hand ,
But there are higher ones i may not see ,
Never was blast from vapour charged with cold ,
The half-grown roses caressing
The tradesman now felt sorely vex 'd ,
There 's nothing now prevails but pride ,
No more the vessel plough 'd the dreadful wave ,
He went behind it to make his last stand .
That air between them could not penetrate .
I felt it was your mission to impart
His thunder on thy head , devouring fire .
Sound and entire , mark well the lore conceal 'd
From which all kinds of colours they beget
And he gave him a mortal thrust ;
North is your friend , and now destruction knocks ,
The largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold ,
With richest wealth of penance stored . ”
O keep us , as the hours proceed ,
Her little face still played in ,
Might gather o'er her beauty , and a gloom
By which souls are together attracted and bound ,
Bring all kinds of blessings to you from above ;
May like holy angels tread .
Cups of sorrow we yet shall drain ;
But bid my women form the milky way .
But her spirit lives , and her soul is part
Where hopes have been shattered and heroes slain
From may till october , the apples shone gay ;
Beyond the fences that lined the way ,
" it was the beauteous scene which made
Where a faint light shines alone ,
To beat away the clang of hellish wings ;
It looked as if the deluge had withdrawn .
To hide the smile it made
And ravish 'd thus , it came to pass ,
That sunk so low that angel form of thine !
The sea 's ambitious waves to bound ,
And war 's stirring tocsin pealed ,
Take all the rest the sun goes round !
But for the one for whom it stands ,
The long cold streets extend once more before us .
Fleetly flies the horrid news ,
Of dazzling science shows his wonders here ;
Some keep the sabbath going to church ;
His hand , too quick to execute his wrath ,
Up sprung the spirits of the waves ,
Speaking in the words which follow :
Paris may change ; my melancholy is fixed .
Oliver feels that death is drawing nigh ;
The words of truth which she addressed to thee !
Tear out this sorrow by the root ;
Then she watched the rooks that perched asleep
Thus round her freedom 's waking steel
That all with mutual impulse tend to god .
Where do your earnings go ? --
And thus the hero ’s feelings found
The imperative chorus rises sonorous and fell :
This little moment mercifully gave ,
To measure how far fifty years have brought us .
The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs
A new-born spring has spread !
Where learning next her early visit paid ,
Of mystery and doom . with aching eyes
The time that you felt just a wee bit proud
The moon mounts high , the night is late :
Your conduct ever makes my heart rejoice .
These as a line thir long dimension drew ,
Nor turn the passion into groundless joy
An emblem of the true your life has stood .
By fickle fortune cross 'd and flung ;
Th ' eternal providence , i well discern :
The silence murmured : " marna ! " and without
She 'd give her thumbs to have him back .
Shall our new england stand erect no longer ,
As long as spring renews the flowery wood ,
That all life had to give us is
Leaving us blank astonishment .
Head-gear brings but pain and sorrow ,
That may put life into this expedition .
Unto swarga such doth go . "
The festival yet lasted / until the seventh day .
And the voice that comes from the yonder sea
Dim hopes that come across my mind
What stench arises from some purple gears ?
I show my thoughts unshamed and proud .
Here they lie had realms and lands ,
Would from their scabbards leap at his command
Where such gray clouds of incense rose
So long as man fancies that fortune will live ,
Which bloom this hour , and fade .
Wave upon wave that broke and whirled
Though dynasties pass .
And urged 'em to scatter and uphold the law ;
Ensample take , of that sche strangeth
Warn her , bard , that power is pressing
The lady was edged with the stamp of race .
And holy vows the mutual peace renew .
Deep meanings shall be hid .
These doves so white will lead me far ,
By this the stars were almost gone ,
Yō ' life soon come an ' go ;
But the clear flame betrayed the haunt by night .
And found it sweeter than his honied bees ,
Shade follows shade by laughing zephyrs drove ,
And stronger than my strength can hold ,
Had you one sorrow and she shared it not ?
When it reached the eve 's repose ,
Weep not ; but say what follows .
The victory to her who fills this grave :
Whom the summer evening sees
Scarce had the holy motive lent its aid
Filling the middle space .
The dancing-master shows the step
In shades that wring from rocks a hollow woe ,
Though the tulips stand on tiptoe to hear ,
Is grown the haunting spirit of the place ;
To follow the hunt thro ' the open country ,
Or mark the message of the morning breeze ,
The dark fell on us through our narrowed eyes ,
Has floated o'er the dream ,
And let each grateful eye reflect thy smile .
That worn sail which argo bore .
His eyes , and pointed to the tomb .
And very grievous to be borne , and lay them
And the voices rise as a tempest far ,
Behold ! the golden age again returns !
And the long shout runs echoing through the skies .
Thus goes his spirit the northland before , --
And the lines he well considers ;
Whereby man ’s hope and heart may steer :
Filled fu ' wi ' clavers about sin
Some stormy clouds that play
Made bliss more hard to bear than pain .
Or afterwards , perhaps ; it passes in
The longer thread of life we spin ,
The look of winged mountains wore .
And though our decembers melt soon into may ,
Caught in the web of the years that pass ,
All make oblation at this shrine .
Now my hope has found fulfilment ;
Till the heart betwixt makes sign ,
Well , let them fight for honor 's breath ,
And all they may hold dear .
And make creation groan with human guilt .
And turn his merry note
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
As though it bore an unseen crown of thorns .
This couplet follows in the ms. :
For the years that are coming swift to you
To-night at roslin leads the ball ,
All the sea 's spirit spoken by a bird ;
Benign , and of our merit take no count .
So here they fall to strife ;
Now this at all events must render cold
That churlish season never frown 'd
For care would cool the flush of life ;
Is roof for some frail thing that hides .
Rabia saw some selfish will
A shadow while the landscape lies in light :
And filled them full of gold so red .
It cures its ills , it calms its strife ;
My soul intent allows no other thought
Forth he drew , with solemn manner ,
The sweetness of joy that we feel .
And night brings a new thing ,
That leaves its shining , silver track behind .
What love could ne'er be brought unto .
Now , sinking underneath a load of grief ,
But still my duty lies in self-denial ;
And the red express my anguish .
So pure the light that darkness sealed my eyelids !
And only bounds its blessings by mankind !
Played with the strength he could employ ,
This judgment rolled from the judgment-seat :
Those villians sought their overthrow .
The flower that once is blown for ever dies .
Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
Smote the province house with terror , struck the
The lake 's calm wavelets rolled ,
Where bright-beaming summers exalt the perfume ;
Which hate-enraged can burn a steady flame ,
Obedient to the will it rolled
And laugh for joy when the tide goes out .
Their eyes a horror claimed in vain ,
The shadows sit and stand within its door
Its tender sorrow touched him as it fell ,
And on the blessed air his fragrance spend .
And vainly thought to clear themselves from blame
Level money , i 'll take the cerise .
Or dry the tears that bathe the untimely urn ?
Our common mother , which gives all their birth .
Attended , charged with those illustrious gifts .
Given all itself as air gives life and light ,
Who gives potatoes eyes . "
Or flushed with fierce dispute , a senseless brawl ;
Whose name through italy and earth shall ring .
Could see the white sails drifting on the sound
My lost joys since her baby came .
Only the echoes , which he made relent ,
Were not the suffering followed by the sense
Draw thy killer to the spot .
The bard may make the sad event his theme .
The cock unto the navy went ;
But he only pointed : bade them heed
And draw men near our lord .
And hell 's sensations seized their swelling chests . --
A quizzical thin smile is showing ,
And there she said these letters might contain
They never feel the breezes blow
What then doth make the element so bright ?
Turning her smile to a fugitive pain .
And why he felt so happy scarce could tell
That never any stranger / weapons here shall bear .
To catch the tunes was his delight ,
From our gross selves it helps us rise
They poured their blessings on his head ,
In the narrow pathway of life to tread --
Shall you search for new adventures ;
Being create of little shapes that roll ;
When the dew of the dawn trembles from it ,
Shall bear my hopes on angels ' wings ,
As any tongue can tell .
To purple ; and a swift wind rose and sang
In the days of my youth that are gone .
When england knew thee thou wert passing fair ;
Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell ,
What shall we do when hope is gone ? "
And the sea rises higher . "
The direst blow on human heart she deals :
Exultingly shall rise ;
And his wishes served to guide him ;
The heights by great men reached and kept ,
What sweetness her snawy white bosom displays !
Strong natures suffer more than those
A vengeful arrow cleaves the air ,
False-faces hung on strings ,
Will fix the colour of the dying stream
And gives me sights in water and in air
In that wild moment when a thrill was sent
Whom orpheus subdued with his musical spell .
His ready wit came soon to understand
When evening takes her on her way ,
For this no other cause occasion gave ,
Have been defeated by that pledge you gave
Under the stars , where the daisies lie
To drown their cares , and discontent ,
That in his house no rising race he saw
And thrilled my breast with more than mortal pain .
As soft as though it fell upon his grave ?
To bring rome in unto the way of life ,
Fain would he flee , his fastness seek ,
And almost catch a glimpse of hell ;
To give the sole charm wanting , -- to convey
The strange tears fall ,
To guide them in the way of truth ,
Nature feels no throb of pity ,
Their kingdoms lost , and desolate
Your painting serves its purpose ! hang the fools !
And dilettanti in the parts appear .
While wintry winds whistle and fast flies the snow ,
When the sun has left the hill-top ,
The charms it finds in thee ! "
Lay their war-crests down and die .
Through recollection , make us entertain
This it is that makes
Who made your beauty seem as star to sun ;
Touches the light and makes it fall and rise ,
Exquisite humour ! that gives him a naming
Flowing , set free the limbs ' lithe grace ,
My feet again , some days gone by .
Yet love has found the way . --
A calm that lifts us from our fallen state ,
By sorrow quick suggested , he began .
Ay , faithful to little boy blue they stand ,
And finally there came a threat
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss .
When thy pack would make thee pain ,
The tide and the summer begin to turn ,
-- with feet that firmly pressed the ground
The maiden 's offer profit with it brought ;
Crisply the bright snow whispered ,
Watching the leaves drift down .
They were set by charlie marshall ,
Beyond us some short space , in answer came .
Whence camp and fleet and city met the eye .
It 's coming yet for a ' that ,
To hold the walls of dogma against fact ,
That keeps , till june , december 's snow ;
To voice the phases of his joyful pain ,
Her face is like a light that runs
Strephon 's kiss was lost in jest ,
He beat all other heirs of crowns ,
Around the bellying tripod rose the flames ,
Some tints of transient beauty may disclose ;
A hundred footsteps scrape the marble hall :
And fresh quarters make them seek . "
Which heroes feel in equal fight . ”
Till bliss in heaven his rites repaid .
From north to south the lyric lights that leap ,
That made the rose 's blush of beauty pale ,
The crashing darkness fell ; our painful breath
And lays his mischief still .
But oh , the wondrous memory lingering .
The man referred to was the professor . i caught
If any farther hopes in arms remain ,
With welcome silence gently glides along ,
Which only asks the chance to live and love ,
Leading it more in sorrow 's way ,
Warm broke the breeze against the brow ,
Can bear the load of poverty ,
Changing to pensive retrospect our gladness !
That trailed , a bright maternal host ,
Within his arms encircled and sustained me ,
Winter is fled away , they sing ,
And put to flight the men , whose labor would
Above the greeks his deathless fame to raise ,
It comes too late to ease his fate .
A balm that heals the wounds of my defeat ,
When the graves give up their dead .
As gifts to daśaratha bore .
So from malicious lips slung forth ,
And still we turn on gala-days to tread
With subtle eyes prepared to understand .
To see the dawn of peace ;
But fix 'd affections to my constant mind .
No noise the silence there to break ,
Unsealed the clasp that held it from control ,
No wilful crime this heavy vengeance bred ;
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it .
And the red lightnings fly ,
" these went one night and found the star
Which priests have always found to compass their abuse .
At night when i would go to sleep ,
For the summer time is coming ,
" i will unfold my sentence and my crime .
All others stray forlorn ,
The infernal glare grew brighter , and there came
And trimmed the lamps as the sun went down ;
To tread the downward , melancholy way ?
Which to my second sire i justly give . "
Shaking and waving , vapour vapour chased ,
Old pleasures crowned with sorrow for a zest ,
When i such a glory might see !
And hope reviving sprang and grew .
And passing heavy grew the hearts of all ,
The rain is gone , except so much as we
In prayer the impulse and the force are found
Which makes us stoop from our aerial heights ,
Butterfly-orchis which never takes wing ,
That drove the bails in disarray ?
The people dead to whom the sea was opened ,
Voices that hailed creation 's primal morn ,
The crowd flows past them like dividing waters .
Far otherwise -- of time it tells ,
It lies , the blood of yon northern knight ,
In soul as countries lieth silent-bare
Whose voice comes as the voice of an only child
His yoke to bear , his work to do ,
The merry prattler sank to quiet rest .
That would make your blood run cold ;
Which keeps the sword from biting to the quick .
It caught the jokers unaware .
The more in this you look for bliss ,
But i can feel thy fortune , and partake
Travel the winding road that wends
And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore .
Which finds itself without a fastening still .
A moan of coming blasts creeps low
Though icy cold by day it ran ,
The bravest quailed ; it swept so near ,
The chains the state has bound on him !
Secure of steel , and fated from the fire ,
Who now has gone to bliss .
Shall the old eons bring me no repose ?
Assumes afresh her shining youth 's attire ,
Friends who could give their love and sympathy ;
And makes provision for him as her own .
The bridge leads into the sunset .
The moors were broke and scattered ( this whilere
And in the hall her presence made complete ,
A spell barbaric over all is spread .
As they would gain the time he spent .
And told his follies to the fitful breeze .
Sad , because though a glorious end it tells ,
Our happiness would dwell --
From every other longing was released .
Magic gave him gifts instead ,
Following from world to world intent i seek . "
Give warning to the world , that i am fled
The albatross did follow ;
And the great boons the monarch gave
Like thee , have talents to regain the friend !
At last a change of luck has made him !
And turned to sleep as unto soothing dreams .
And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath .
And every bird that flutters wings of tan ,
With their flames thrust like a sword ,
That fills thy soul , of sorrow bred ,
As smiling she makes all things plain .
Strength like theirs to stay ,
May dwell while seasons sweetly fly .
" deep in the rock to which it clings ,
Breaking and dimming into shreds ,
And such the hopes that fate denied ; --
And still revealed her lovely , and unclean --
Undeformed by wasting sickness . "
Each fiery eye to lanká turned .
The good sword stood a hand-breadth out
To show that one heart was loyal yet .
Touched with the sanctifying thoughts which wait
How it gushes and struggles out
The storm came on before its time :
The balance of her powers adjust ,
The music that assuaged her there was you .
As doth your rational ; and both contain
While chief baron ear sat to balance the laws ,
The ground of grief remove ,
With a view to rise in the social scale ,
Vainly strives he peace to find ,
Years rolled on ; but the last one sped --
A voice arose from the brethren then :
Fresh voices make a rich refrain ,
The vital joy that breathes itself in bloom ;
I made strange pictures , conjured images
Thus my heart trembles with love !
They 'll never let him coinless go .
It held before its ivory face
Its brightness soon exhaled away
Yet sense of native freedom still remains ,
That through his laughter , love and terror run ?
Chokes down the rising agony ,
Now the green corn has sprouted . each new day
“ on our adventure come ; but slew him not
The hour which sees our prison door
For the lord christ came dead souls to claim
Her own dear home was reached at last ;
Minds bewitched that served as mirrors
Your eyes will e'er attain such scope .
Of the quivering lake he spread
Hast broken the slumber that encompassed me ,
That hangs before her all the year ,
That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light .
And there lay their secret cold and bare ,
That adverse gods commit to stern debate
Shaking , confirm 'd the word . but hector found
He followed each hope the heights that would scale
To swell one bloated chiefs unwholesome reign ?
The hours that leave the slightest cause to weep
The life within me seems to swim and faint ;
And even here the money flies . }
O'er this their columns pass 'd ; apollo bore
Through dolops ’ shoulder urged his forceful dart ,
Dawn on its fluted brow painted rainbow light ,
The blast that wakes the fury of the sea ?
To ask our counsel , or our orders take ,
Where she believes the place of meeting lies .
Ah , life grows lovely where you are ;
Within his heart the shadow rose and cried ,
So lone and cold they lie ; but we ,
I see , and pity you ; and then
The big round tear stands trembling in her eye ,
Lonely and wearily life wears away .
No cloud in heaven to slake its ray ,
As the fine touch of blindness makes a page
Lo ! truth and virtue range their radiant bands ;
Where bright-beaming summers exalt the perfume ;
Where grief ca n't reach you more !
To-night at roslin leads the ball ,
Go . each tiny , lapping flame of fire
Had somehow mixed up deus with their theology ?
From every eye , an ample witness came .
The naked and forlorn must feel
Backward he sprang , his courage wholly quelled
The moon upon that dreary country shed ,
And saw a future with all good things rife --
" this morning came your truly welcome letter of monday
Eagerly ask for a hint of the glug ,
Until the grave doth fold us with the dead .
Heavy , crushing , wearing , slow ,
With her had made him loosen from the port ;
Ah , who may all this splendor own ?
The earth shall pass , but love abide .
Their souls might feast upon some mystic sign ) ,
What dreams , what themes they bring --
Thine earth now springs , mine fadeth ;
Is shown through nature 's whole analogies ;
Bright for one moment drifts a white sail by ,
A wicked whisper came , and made
Swells rippling through the aged trees , that stand
In a streight way between two mountains wrought .
Cast him , adoring and forlorn ,
Restoring my lost youth on perfumed air !
From sea to sea -- a nation grown --
Thoughtless and laughing . -- words can not express
Producing fear , doth plainly come .
And calm i feel there quick doth fall
Food that maketh the blood feel choice ;
Forever and ever , where no evil is wrought
External trifles with our sorrows blend !
Whereon our liberties we found ;
They gave him credit for cunning and skill ,
Whose waves that glass the floating swan , reveal
Rough ashes sat he for his soul 's reprieve ,
While yet thy roses stir the lazy air
If his good lance at the encounter flies .
And think of what the years may hold ;
That christmas season 's sales should ever close !
Thy dark waves glide ; and shadows long and wide
It makes the spirit creep .
In the nest-life made for lovers ,
Or nobly face the horrid front of war ?
Long time thy brethren stood in fear ;
He thereon feeds his hungrie fantasy ,
When poverty is seen from them they fly :
In division so were they linked .
Whose poem phoebus challenged for his own ;
Their chocolate gave nourishment and zest ,
But , and this makes the case so sad ,
I dare not show less pity unto thee . "
The piper 's face fell , and he cried ;
What sways the life the moment doth bestow :
My song might shadow forth that saintly smile ,
Scorn of conquest filled like sleep
The job will not bring you to fame
That it can not touch my heart .
And onward went upon his high employ ,
And make my home in forests too . ”
When the ninth month had passed over ,
And made men like thee , though thy making bound
Which on the harp of life sweet music made ,
Forest-mother , formed in beauty ,
Almost three years were ended ; when there came
With groans that make the mountains shake ,
The pure october weather fills
But there my brother lakshmaṇ stands :
His laughter shakes the leaves .
As darkness hides all colours from the blind ?
Builded and fashioned out of truth ,
Mere flitting clouds before the rain .
In the bill we already have drawn on remorse ,
God seeth the flower of france laid low ;
And the truth now i have shown ,
Successive myriads to run their race ,
Wholly passes my patience .
With store of tears this treason gan unfold ,
And life born young again ,
Where the spine joins it . not more furiously
Adverse to these shall then in glory come ,
That we may be able to mount to heaven ,
Lip of beauty , fare thee well !
Yea , not a kiss which i have given ,
The red leaves hang there still , -- but now
Willow-wood gave him a flute so fair ,
That to your friends ye give
When goodness has been gained and truth made clear ,
The shadows lay along broadway ,
Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh ,
Why , yet to show that thou art just ,
The saddest thought the creature brings ?
Dead mouths of many dreams that sing and sigh .
And hold discourse with mother mine . ”
From differing earths his various nature grows :
And thou wilt give me grace of dawn
Then finding that love came not back to me ,
To drive the cold winter away .
Her cause you pleaded and her ends you sought ;
And that the government they hold so dear
The more they incanted the tighter it got .
Dark broodings turn to find their lonely lair ;
And heaven again shall give thee room . ”
Pass away the great traditions ,
The weakness which thus to himself hath been shown ?
So filled his heart with joy that it has burst
Only my heart to my heart shall show it
Breaking upon the midnight of sad skies .
There , where reply to innocence is made .
Before he gave his paradise to fame ,
There set in order my experiences ,
When death takes its young .
Now unto thee can manifest be made .
Her weary body seemed to find repose .
Turning his eyes from my sorrowing .
When word came to the carline wife
It may bring faint relief ! -
Fragrance and passionless music woven as one ;
Our grand army gives ;
The wind 's soft kisses hover on their faces ;
Antilochus by falsehood down , and led
And from the sun the sea 's breath blew ,
Bring home the triumph of our victory :
His old face grew , for self and greed
The silence broke , and thus their errors told :
Pillowed on lilies that still told the sweet
Mingle in thanksgiving
When the foe has reached this trust ;
And froze the genial current of the soul .
Ah , blush not while it flows ;
There lies forever
Should she pay thee no attention ,
To man alone i owe my birth ,
The throne of the tyrant shall rock and quake ,
Where the quick lightning scored its trunk , yet still
Since fame that sides with these , or goes before
By looking on the vengeance which , concealed ,
Lays his whole weight of heat upon
From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the
And let fame blow her trumpet through the world
That envious natures might succeed .
Also , there 's something now , you see ,
Truth never fails , nor beauty waxes old ;
Had already an opening to paradise shown ;
But rather seekes my sorrow to augment
My jeffrey held him up as an example
May show each glow of being with each strife
The charm it holds for the restless rover ;
Twenty curious eyes stared at him ,
And greece stood up to fight for liberty ,
Its pinnacle should reach the sky .
Of strange eyes flashing through the haze .
But it seems to come from a tomb .
The nodding watch ; each to his office takes .
Ere many they of various fashions found .
With deep remorse may read the mournful song ,
A song made in the rebellion .
I see them shining where a rainbow shook .
My soul goes up , with joy ,
Therefore to thee it was given
With no work done , but great works undone ,
See them with bliss-exhaling pinions winging
Yet not for all his faith can see
More melancholy tun 'd its bellowing song .
By lips that never their words betray 'd .
Have filled the air awhile with humming wings ,
It serves its purpose passing well .
Then a long , stealing shadow to me crept ,
Whence i to visit them the custom took .
Blindly yielding herself to the errors of life ,
To shade her face so passing fair .
To pray , repent , and bring obedience due .
Shall hold thy purposed enterprise in doubt ,
And all the shadows fell behind .
This is my choice : for why ? i find
Could close them into forms and scatter them
And pass into the pleasant realms of sleep ,
From what once lovely lip it springs unseen !
When the stars threw down their spears ,
But enough of its glory remains on each sword ,
Though gregory lies where marne runs down ,
The youthful day , the west her dwelling made ;
Two talents lay of gold , which he should take
The victim 's triumph tells .
To the fool that takes him down .
To whom the gentle sister made reply ,
Still must that tongue some wounding message bring ,
The fitful flare of the moon fled fast ,
Where are those darts on which the fates attend ?
So is that step as good as never made .
The duty that lies nearest .
O'er whom such thankful tears were shed
Seen the rosy wine that flows there ?
Just coming from a sedentary life ,
Thy tireless wings yet own no fear .
Me , memory of my loss will only meet .
Makes earth remember , and forget , the skies .
Mourned a shawm 's voice subdued ,
April came to bloom and never dim december
What girl is this i see ?
Valiant , by no fears assailed ;
With life to serve , and , pass reward ,
Once more his blighted spirit was revived
Down the pale cheek moist sorrow steals ,
Not distant , on the happy coast she stood .
His labour and his trials , there was drawn
The day hath scarcely passed that saw thy birth ,
Till you reach my heaven of dreams .
To modern memories cling .
Wars are their gain , whatever cause is found --
With horrid strides , hell trembled as he strode .
The lark sang loud and high ,
Above us storms distract the sky ,
Night , dreadful night , is gathering fast ,
Brighter hopes than his can shew .
And shall death quell that radiant song
She could not bear a jealous heart .
In the very words which follow :
It lives on the lips of the angels
To make the dread experiment alone .
Could ever brave his mighty arm ?
Till war has hushed his cannon , --
My silent south lies proudly still .
To him long absent , to his love returned ,
When that first list come out .
It was a blow that went through every limb !
As if that voice had quicken 'd some dead thing
Fair leaves had taken of the loving twain .
The age is come that shakes your thrones ,
What your own good sense should tell you ?
Of heaven and earth had faded : deepest shades
Pierced with pain the pilgrim lay ;
Design , or chance , makes others wive ;
My heart goes back to wander there ,
She melted into tears --
Dark colors wear the best , it 's true --
Next prussia took his turn to melt ,
Mingled in wild confusion bleed :
Where the miracle lies anchored . "
Supplied such relics as devotion holds
Roused by its voice the ghastly wars arise ,
To do what they had gladly left undone ,
Born for a life that knows no struggle
Yet it a relish gives to food and rest .
Vile treason were it such a pact to make ;
Grotesquely wonders come to pass .
Which tells me , youth 's no longer here !
Her gathered beams , great palace now of light .
Will you bring her a heart as strong and brave
Drew nearer , how our downward course we wound .
Bring the prayer of a little one . '
And never a minute did they stand .
When knotty questions would arise .
May tempt a second wooing ; "
And in my heart i hear a voice that calls
While the sign of battle flew
O heaven -- the solitude thy soul has dared !
Feeling is all the senses joined in one .
And paths went wandering beneath the sweep
In pencil each anecdote noted .
If i e'er took the offer 'd bribe
Which helped the shoe-man make his haul .
When the hand that bears the flag is brave ,
And the duke godfrey , did attract my sight
The luck will alter and the star will rise .
Her witching , terrible smiles compel .
Why should we breathe the sigh of fear ,
Whose intricate fingers beat and glide
Who thither came , to yield her charms
In all her charms set virtue in their eye ,
So we 'll make a mellow hour :
Proud troy shall tremble , and desert the war ;
And nought can richer grace to mortals yield .
Soul for whom the floating forceless ages waited
So follow ! while the flowers break forth
S for the snail that showed
The happiness that we have given partake ?
Keen hopes shot tremulous through every vein ;
No sailor on deck his stand could keep .
With burning eyes bending over a needle ,
My faint spirit was sitting in the light
A train of satin that sweeps the floor --
Her tranquil eyes shall penetrate afar
Sudden the sun dropped down
An orb of lustre quits the height ;
Is therefore fit to have a government ;
And happily had passed his life ,
Let laurelled marbles weigh on other tombs ,
In sudden light they shone and heavenly harmony .
And all for combat fit the rattling car .
That i can hardly follow with my fingers .
Which fate demanded . by the sea 's despite
Naughty little noses , to lead them astray !
For had the martial menelaus found
That through each room a golden pipe may run
So cross him with their opposite persuasion ,
Before earth made of him her sleepy care ;
The marble speaks it , mary stone :
Take care that it be so .
Of luminous hair and supple limbs combining ,
The nations from their fear have freed .
But my blind ways destroyed the cords that drew ;
Of adverse battle , their encampments form .
And zone that clung around her gentle waist
Born into life ! -- we bring
Within the stall , pierced by her yearning still .
As that which makes thy whisper fate ,
And scattered sunlight flecks the gloom ,
Curses came mingled with wails and reproofs ,
Thither flies her heart to join her treasure ,
The managed winds , now forcible , as best
I 'd rather feel thy trust in me unbroken
This is the armed troop that represents
Where late affection 's sweetest pictures smiled .
With jeers of many pouring on to them .
When night came , all worn and tired ,
That the question to pop you felt strongly inclined ,
But what a weary length of lingering toil remains !
To bind the loveless joyless vow ,
His black eye flashed an angry fire ,
Cheering each other on to face the fight ,
Take heed that in thy verse
Low stooping from the cloudy gray ,
Life passionately rises under the sky !
As they through the forest are soaring away .
Wave us away , and keep thy solitude !
Of their own loveliness , some violets lie .
The future tenour will to thee unfold . "
Whichever path he take , will find that goal
Which will not let the guilty rest .
And in did come the strangest figure !
And the form of youth he stole .
Our human touch did on him pass ,
With no lost labour or dishonoured name ;
Of wantonness and blasphemy go up !
Sooner the sun bedimmed the world should view
They shut him in , and set a guard ,
Formed long ago , yet made to-day ,
" to those new , rising states belongs ,
In her chaste current oft the goddess laves ,
They settled to the slot and disappeared .
At thy hoard , take care to spread it
Till death shall lay you low .
Till heaven unsealed its hoarded springs ,
Courage , if sorrow come , to bear it ,
That my soul knows its own
And there came a smile on his face
They never felt happier up on high .
Will gather the whole nation , recruit all creation ,
Unwelcome the waking which ceases to fold thee .
So long , till the relenting marble wears ;
But there came no cry from a new attack ,
Who held a warring nation in his heart ;
But how with them whose memory makes them sweet ?
At one end one , that gave upon a range
Little flames came wading out ,
At night our souls are mingled and made one ,
With shiv ' ring anguish passed before my sight .
The gay who find aught to wake laughter ,
To lead to reason this most erring daughter ,
And all the twisting art that but astounds .
And of how near i come to tears . )
Nor stand subdued with reverence and awe
But a wondrous change came o'er them ,
Put trust in plighted word ;
And feel the rapture which delights their breasts :
He keeps his vow with constant heart .
That show the womb shall thrive ,
To heights that know no wrong .
Tears unlock my heavy eyelids ,
The frown of the great spirit fell
Ghost-like and gray loomed the eternal snows .
And the sins of the dying seem passing away .
Were fashioned as the sort we see ,
With honest pride the gift i take ,
The wind blew words along the skies ,
That only serves to make us grieve
They 'll think that i 'm gone mad ,
A readier way to heaven may go .
And good hath followed , -- may it now !
At last the boys had found a cushy job .
Heed the words his law commends :
-- that only serves to make us grieve
In silence shed the sympathetic tear .
That brings us the delicious scent
There 's a grief too hard to bear ;
At england 's mercy ! could that force but grow
That hath begun to show her bloom ,
And after him the wretch in pomp conveyed ,
Yet the love i bear to thee
There comes a voice that calls me from afar :
Nothing flourishing , flimsy , affected , or vain .
The tree that bears apples all the year round .
That say thy sweet is bitter ,
Nor to sleep will they conduct thee ;
Because a saint had stood in it ;
She left her joyful harpings in the sky ,
The mourning from our hearts shall not be taken ,
Which is followed by union , among our tribes .
For , since no deep within her gulf can hold
Or by the medicine restored , gives signs ,
This which goes cleaving the audacious prow ,
My thoughts hold mortal strife ;
Thus to blunt the spears of wizards ,
They plunged again into the wondrous torrent ,
This thy desire may bring us bitter woe ,
No moon flows up the satin night
But why invoke the ages long gone by ,
The lark will make her hymn to god ,
And left the rest to fate .
The radiance of the morning , and now stood
Through which the soft white fibres peer ,
So meanly passes , that all other lots
And earnest thoughts within me rise ,
In answer set ? what agency doth this ? "
Music has put her triple finger-print ,
Mark what proficiency in that he made ,
You take a cloud of a silvern hue ,
Of those who hold the kingdoms in control
Shall open wide to let each sorrow enter ,
He 'd fight every foe he could meet ;
And , marked with sanguine sweat and tears ,
Half conscious , caught the tinkle of a rill
Here sweetly spread a landscape of lorraine ;
This made the angel call at reeds and thatch ,
They get your coin the neatest ,
And for all nourishment he brings his heart .
Upon the desolate waste itself had spread ;
But i , whom griping penury surrounds ,
Oh misery ! to climb the steep of life
Of earthly life , that swells and breaks
Or pleasure 's substance for its shade to miss .
Their silent influence added to her store ;
We gave him justice as the ages rolled ,
Then on the delicate air there came to him
Filling their souls with fears .
And , smouldering in the breaking brown ,
The thought is past , the dream is gone ,
Of striped agates struck her like cold frowns
Slighting the petty need he showed ,
She thus might give the welcome of the dead :
And holy joy about the earth is shed ;
And the world went past her , and said
The winter season broke before the spring .
On the rising wind the banshee cries --
Reckless of wounds , in that grim toil pressed on
In that blissful abode , brightly shines forth
The man of prayer can only draw
Love only can these wonders show .
It wraps and enthralls
Would swallow him , and so his errors hide .
Grief was our minstrel of things that endure .
That pity which for terror thou hast taken .
And once again , where the wide tides ran ,
In love and peace they measured back their way .
Life i must bound , existence sum
Until the day when life shall bid it rise .
Old colonel bogey laid it out .
Said young werner , " could i venture ?
There enter moments of an azure hue ,
Where wisdom 's mines hide their pearls and gold .
In scorn of nature , art gave lifeless life :
And yield a pleasure better than gold .
And mourn o'er joys too bright to last .
It holds some fairer woman for your bride ;
Turned the language inside out ,
Still on the fearful monster passed ,
Health suffers , and the spirits ebb ; the heart
Had touched the deep , mysterious chords ,
Thy countless stars in heaven shall stay :
I feel that the summer is all for me ,
A moment yet , with breathing quickly drawn
I tracked my comrades through the burning town .
The hour was come that called the second watch
Sends out its melancholy cries .
The heedless world hath never lost .
And brought the tears on a happy day ;
Goes straight to the ears of god . "
And sowed a wind of shame
Thro ' misty windows bend my musing sight
To find how very badly she selected .
Who think to make us good by rule ;
And they who do make mention of the same ,
Until the hours of absence should run through ,
I feel myself quietly falling in love .
Shall this vast sorrow spend itself in vain ?
Rise and fill the air with anguish .
Where the field-lark lifts his cry
You should find favor , too , at rome .
And offer of his royal person made .
Shivering i catch sight of them
Pierced by some ambush 'd archer of the night ,
To follow ever with insatiate arms .
To pallas made , meantime the virgin , drawn
Whose own example strengthens all his laws ;
A shout cried by a thousand sentinels ,
Till fell the evening damp with dew ,
Each aiding each , their joyful tasks pursue .
And there lie the joys were so surely expected !
( whenas the dirges pierce the gloom )
And in his magic fetters gladly lies ;
But to bring -- so ran the tale --
Whahl he hiz sacred office does sustain !
A full sea glazed with muffled moonlight , swell
New hopes , old yearnings winging slowly
Whose flight can give what men never give ! --
That gives her entrance to the blissful bowers .
But god gives his beloved sleep .
That voice is round me like a bursting sea :
Or take from fire the power to warm ,
A change when fortune either comes or goes ;
And bitter fate . to speak he made essay ,
His sword and pen defends the cause ,
Near to the monarch ’s palace drew .
Has the wilderness told it thee ?
Let cowards beat the breast and wail ,
Swift as the eye can mark ,
Which comes to pass each moment of our lives ?
And dusky faces passed and woke
The welcome load of my dear father take ;
That there at every season / was pleasant pastime found
The rue of tears now paying
Fair to the eye that injured honour rise --
The image came of my majestic swan
The gnat lit on her master ,
And that diviner fountain whence it came .
Though never yet in any fault you lay :
Of comets which had gone astray ,
" the danger is easily braved :
Low at thy feet renew her vows ;
Before me lay the desert way --
No fear more fearful than its own may find
And god gave answer thus :
From the stones the parched corn taking ,
They never yet could find my measure .
Until the sea gives up its dead .
That held serene a limned picture there ,
And weighed with spoils of vanquished foes --
And that at anchor before portsmouth lay .
From the ceiling it reaches the floor ;
No sound comes from it .
Making new year 's calls .
Drive all thy fear and doubt away ;
Met that racked visage with his own unmoved ,
Their golden urns reciprocally lending ,
By reason of the wrappage following it ;
O love that passes the love of woman !
Do thou turn thine eyes to north-west ,
Man 's nature tends to universal rest :
Had drawn me wholly , to its burning top .
My eyes from out the shambles where they lie ;
And we 've life and love to spare ;
Whom they called ursula . the moonlight fell
All the world over , nursing their scars ,
Far fall the day when england 's realm shall see
Freedom asks your common aid , --
The ivy clambered and the rose-vine ran .
There with him to offer battle ;
That with their weight they make the balances
Amidst their weapons i had found my fate ,
But kept the aching for its own .
No mystic dream could make their fates appear ,
Laugh or not , the tears will fall ,
Our way will lie through forest ground
Chain him -- he 'll the bonds remove :
On thy wings bring sweetest honey ,
Hear the woes that infants bear --
The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned .
To feel cold hands at his heart ?
That has sent it rolling downward ,
The smile that comes like a starry light
Which led him safe to his abode .
And all that comes is past expectancy .
When lo ! on board a fond debate arose ;
The playmate given to glad my way ;
Vigilant , i make haste to close
Not dreams of empires shattered where they lie ,
And lay you straight , the fools that loved you
Beneath them years and ages passed . he said ,
Delay not : ere the western sky is hung
By some gone winter 's blast -- in flashing lines
Spending faster than it comes ,
Rich blessings come to those who thee maintain .
Horrible creatures stir amid the slime ,
That 's lighted by the bright flame of thy hair
Shadow cast by helicon 's rustling forests ;
But keep your fancy free . "
It threw its odors on the sickly air !
Two rude cut letters mark the owner 's name ;
That on the window lay .
Oh , ponder what it means !
The gracious footprints of his love i trace .
And bruise the seed first risen from our line .
Balmy and soothing , bringing us relief .
In songs made up of whimpering cries
While simple melody pour 'd moving on the heart .
So the quarrel arose and i went to law .
' twere best : to give him pain ,
Oilean ajax rises to the race ;
And bless the toil through which the victory lay ,
Nor the time is given to chanting . "
My eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears ,
Of spain at last . onward the mountains came
When brain and spirit fail , and laziness
The flow of his deeply drawn sadness .
And heavenly talents make infernal hearts ;
We have found that the faithful father created
Their loss had made them lads apart .
Where the old flotilla lay ,
Autumn , thy rushing blast
To whom should fall the prize .
Sure such another never yet was made ;
What fills my soul with gladness ?
In her hazel eyes her thoughts lay clear
His heart one prayer did make :
Till lust , and wrath , and pride depart .
Our hearts shall breathe the old refrain ,
Now again he hunts the lost-words ,
A balm to all other hearts may bring ;
And kill them when it serves your ends .
The smiles , that follow shine more brightly .
That beats for thee alone , in vague unrest .
The languid music swells and falls .
And holy recollections through domes are straying .
Which put off business to the ensuing session :
Love wrought such things as bred my smart ,
And his bullets whistle .
A gloom that gathers silence looms more closely ,
So many years the toils of greece remain ;
And those whose snares the peacock caught ;
And drop cold rains , then lift and show
An orange-bellied turtle scooped the mud ;
Down below there creeps a viper ,
Is made the velvet touch of her .
To get that title by the sword ,
When the calm twilight leaves the heaven most holy ;
Every heart now yearns for glory ,
The waves lie still and gleaming
It comes from the glen on the gale ,
As that shrill clarion the silence broke .
The mighty baptist that way marks the line
Shall brush the placid flood , till thou arrive
And hope shall be crowned , and attachment rewarded ,
For darkness comes with night , his paramour ,
Gave me to face the orient . nor our way
The paths run swiftly away under the lamp glow
Again it was morning , but shrunk and cold ,
Of the true city should discern the tower .
" but accidents like this , you see ,
God give us grace in every place
Then when his swelling heart had shrunk ,
The graces that attend her .
So many weary miles had made him steer ,
A golden star hangs in the night ,
None to give the hand of welcome ;
Where is the golden hope that led
Their words come to .
Dark hills whose heath-bloom feeds no bee ,
And tripura in death laid low .
A dull repose , indeed , might find :
When the worlds have passed in night . "
Know , therefore , when my season comes to sit
Who deems that life has found a grave ?
Each night they held a coterie ,
Their courses , gliding through the silent sphere ,
Did not believe , accept , found in him little
Forsaking mercies which our father gave .
The gloom that blinds the view of human souls .
The cross of fire should take its road .
Fills me full of joy and pride ,
Men to follow kitty to adventures strange and new .
Flashes the lightning , bringing in its train
Who hold in their hues cool dawns ,
Is that which gives to sin a livelihood .
The simple to the common brings ;
The pennons fell bedewed with gore .
The moving whisper of huge trees that branch 'd
Has it been conveyed to strangers ,
Horizons firm that faith and hope attain ,
And scarce their rulers check their martial rage . "
Seamen their records keep ,
The happiness of man lies in pursuing ,
Forest-mother , formed in beauty ,
So round the gin went , hot and heady ,
In pushya ’s favouring stars will dwell :
These years have made me turn to lamorak
These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake ,
The amorous bee will spring upon the lotus .
And lend to the rhyme of the poet
The winds at night had made a rout ;
Its ready succour gave ;
Dread persia whose fleet chariots charged and won
And seek the closer presence of their god ,
Where roads are made i lose my way .
The old road i have taken ;
Strong consolations ; leave them not to doubt
Without him , made directly africk 's strand ,
And mountains rise , and oceans roll between ,
The frigates were with vengeance stored ,
My spirit bows with mighty grief oppressed ,
In ships within the stream that lay ,
From which this desolation came ; --
A power to stand through shock and stress ,
I watch it rise and set :
But all at once he got a shock --
Of joyous days ye bring the blissful vision ;
To bliss alike by that direction tend ,
Where three roads joined it was green and fair ,
By love so vainly fed :
That swept across my startled thought 's abyss !
Each time i take a second look ,
Gild the melancholy gloom ,
The hand which still held juan 's , by degrees
Will they be touched with the verisimilitude ?
Methinks love 's very title says enough :
Taken from life while life and love were new ,
That the sound together drew .
Perhaps his tiger 's blood cooled then , perhaps
And a flame that shook from the rocks overhead
E'en truth itself he put upon the proof :
Lie open to thy searching eyes . ”
With fog , and made the heaven above intent ,
She moved to the notes of a magical song ,
In what he gives to thee , this paradise
For spring to pass along here !
Love summons them here straightway to divorce
The reverence struck me ; o'er each head
Not _ then _ alone 't was felt ,
Baffled , bewilder 'd , they stray .
That made the west a fairyland ,
Blending of lute and voice that drew the souls
And , filled with sweetness , as a shell
Thereby regaind , but sat devising death
When we say " the blast is gone ! "
The southern breezes die that blew with vigor ,
Where is the lore the baptist taught ,
Can make the bitter draught go down ;
While greece a heavy , thick retreat maintains ,
And yet it shall not make the finger sore .
Some take comfort from a star ,
Of madness havoc-breathing , and it passed
When sorrow darts direct the feverish ray ;
As comes to me or cloud or sun ,
Who sage reserve in her demeanor showed .
Shall all unite to swell the mighty song ;
He gives no strength for coming ill ,
And youth , still flashing from his eyes
That sweeps old ocean 's strand ;
Must miss what other men count being ,
That what their lord devised made and wrought .
Him that brings thee countless treasures ,
Finds happiness unblighted , or if found ,
How merrily it goes !
The spirit 's might shall o'er thee rise ,
Though thunders roared and lightnings glared ,
And here they love to weave their dancing ring ,
The guard his message bore , where at their ease
Thence to the bait of women lay exposed .
Though moments of sorrow to all must be given ,
Of heaven 's increasing bright allure ,
Which would not ask me to admire ,
I sink back shuddering from the quest .
Which fills a poet 's eyes . beneath his robe
Half blind with gathering tears ,
The boat pressed ever through the weeds and sedge
Her smile is the sweetest that ever was seen :
The rising storm forbids . the news arrives :
With dawn the tide went seaward , bearing her
And the hills and valleys answered ,
Then replied in words which follow :
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore ,
Her nursling 's speech first grow articulate ;
And easter sunday gleamed upon the sky ;
But must the witness of thy guilt be made ?
The blossoms slept , -- i sought a place
Of stream and zephyr stole into my ear .
And each had shown how light we far 'd along
A crown for the cross which here they bore ;
This evil came on william at the first .
It grieved when the forest was forced to fall ,
Will truth explain , or mystery confess .
A year has passed ; the forest sleeps
The wind that blew from cassiopeia cast
And the wretched council 's bosoms beat ,
I see how victory , how conquest flies . "
Such slender dimensions go somewhat to show
There to get the lid in colors ,
And to my heart such kindly courage ran ,
What pleasure thro ' my veins you spread !
Whose dancing lights contract the deep
Seemed only to be tarred with evil --
That feels sensation 's faintest thrill ,
't was pity nature brought ye forth ,
These ears shall catch the music of thy shades ;
Let these clouds bring snow and
Within the court , around their father , sat
And catch the holy fires that burn
Memory sets the bells a-ring !
Brought to her the thought of sadness ,
In charity 's espousals are made one .
Making arrangements for their bright vacation ,
It calls , and down the old church aisle
The place you look for it in vain ,
Which passes through the veins itself to make them .
Thus men who saw him move among mankind ,
And every shore it circles thine !
Which in the final judgment thou shalt see . "
I see make room for thee to bide
And where his radiant arms lay on the field .
It whispers in the summer breeze
Where long extended plains of pleasure lay :
And in this lonely spot , love found
At the symptoms i feel of decay .
( and took his post behind the heavenly guide )
With moonlight fallen in pools of light ,
Cards make not the children cease to weep .
Like a mating bird that hails the spring .
" he rose from dreams of war 's alarms ,
He took his place upon the double throne ,
Which a man may take for a rest .
Hath covered all the labouring villages .
A night of sultry clouds involved around
There came a softness in the air
The time i 've lost in wooing ,
My voyage , ere i reach my native land .
And making them giddy with passion .
And again captain sword in his pride doth come ;
France goes rolling all around ,
From heaven they fabled , thrown by angry jove
That which my speech no farther can declare .
What rites they follow , and what god adore !
The vision of the agony would loom
Was but a vision that would soon depart :
Ablaze , and black smoke hovered on the air .
Shine the volumes in gold and browns ,
And find sweet employment to fill up each day .
From bondsmen 's tears and lash of slavery .
And get himself in dreams the vatican ,
Love , -- love and truth forever shall prevail .
When life went so like a dreamy rhyme
And steps that met the breaker ! there was none
Where camped erewhile the moorish forces lay ;
The brave malprime has pressed his steed across
No slackness there was found ;
The brightest wit can find us ;
To ages following ,
But held his own in the fight next day ,
For tidings of glad sound had come ,
He , from his face removing the gross air ,
And other flowers lay upon
Then silence fell ; and mr. long was born .
Do you remember how the tears stood in my eyes
And , sweetly tuned , his praises sang :
Such tears would make it flawless ,
When severed darkness , all flaminical bright ,
Sorrow itself shall sway him like a dream .
Do you say " she gave consent :
There flowers and flowers and flowers were traced .
Till supreme sleep shall bring me bloodless ease ;
Our hearts unto each other , even in childhood !
The neck that made that white robe wan ,
That with fresh grief her bosom stirred .
Unendingly till england 's empire come ; "
Here where primordial fear , the gorgon , sits
Into an angel whom no grief can sap ,
And soon the ball was lost .
A whole world lies cryptic in each human breast ;
There 's a grand , grand view unfolding .
The left arm , as for battle , bears again
Which rattle snake has lent the crowd ,
Such chains as his were sure to bind .
And rolls the ocean lower than the land .
And a low breeze crept moaning by , --
Which stir the fadeless foliage dreamfully ,
But yonder see where the rock-plants lie !
And mist blew off from teme ,
But no -- their hour is not yet come --
Who see no hope that can elude the doom ,
Time is dealt out by particles ; and each ,
And more than a hundred spirits sat within .
_ and now the columns stand a forest speechless
Into fragments that bunch as they run --
If they continue rational , as made ,
Thy father ’s doom which sends thee there ;
Excuses , turn not from the proof , but bend
And his whiteness mocked my sin .
Which misled albion proclaim ’d afar ,
Before whose heavenly hues all sorrow disappears .
And several artists claimed attention there ,
With high desire made musical and fleet .
Nor pain nor anguish feel .
Formed his frugal fare and feasting .
Until the weary lagging ship reached shore .
Makes us feel our mortality in fact
What cowardice in her valour could reside ;
Between the lofty tombs could mark
Of god hath left its mark sublime
" what good gift shall god give us ? "
The wandering breeze that stirs the grove ,
Clear as the swallow 's voice . keen anguish seized
A word , and straight the play had stopped .
By steaming bolts that tamed their pride :
The peevish cricket raised a creaking cry .
I feel once more the eyes that smiled ,
Nor yet content , she strains her malice more ,
How like decaying life they seem to glide !
In what our deeds shall say ,
My sight directed , and on either side
Days and weeks and months they sped ,
Of fiercely-breathing war . the truth was felt
The unseen ocean surging close beneath .
The power to judge all subjects which were brought
Nor to evil purpose turns them . '
Of spring with which it circles you .
What joy then filled thy bosom , father dear
What talk they held soever , for they thought
Where ships had rode and breakers roll 'd
And the smooth handmaids pay their vows
When our glory has passed ,
But when the even brings surcease ,
And chanting the rhyme that was graven there
And in my breast thine eyes have lit a fire
Much gentleness and courtesy appear ,
And distant from each other burn 'd the lights ,
Shall bear thee to the bosom of the sea .
To hold their peace is all the wayes
These lights that catch the mountains crest by crest ,
Alfred vargrave , in tracking a mountain abyss ,
And such joys as these she 'll bring . --
And ellen felt most grateful to the lord .
If any one had seen what passed ;
" if the need for food should seize thee ,
And windless sky and brings no dreams
Steering thro ' heaven , as tho ' she bore
I 'll soon put on my womanhood and marry
Whole ages of heartless and wandering bliss ;
From his calm eyes there gleamed a little fire ,
To me alone there came a thought of grief :
Until the final orders had been passed ,
Sorrow renewed , in mournful repetition ,
He counts it as no sin
Heart of him melt there ,
Since death is ever pressing at your heels ,
While all her pulses rise
But treasured ever you keep the pain that causes
The waters chant their requiem ;
But death is the worst that comes of thee ;
The narrowing rails that meet to pierce the distance ,
The sky lay on the deep ; within the clouds
Smash ! went the windows all :
With proofs here flowed the sea profound .
Protuberances rank with lust ,
The party closed at sundown ,
They gathered strength enough to stone the prophet .
And bubbles rise to the fountain 's brim .
Ten leagues and four the structure grew ;
The roughened sea brought nigh , across him cast ,
With frantic valor fired the crew
And the question heard again :
Their fortunes stood .
He for their weakness shall give strength ,
Our faces shine with kindled sense of god
Except of sighs , that made th ' eternal air
That blew to blazing all my hate ,
His fate had crept below the lifted swords ,
And see how his stock went on .
Whose deeds tradition saves ;
Loving his lusty youthhood yielded to him .
The old rhyme keeps running in my brain ;
Immortal things still give us dream .
A voice clung sobbing till he questioned it ,
' mid sweet interpositions moves along
While folly took
What numbers fell ! what numbers yet shall fall !
We rest our hopes on thy free grace alone ,
So grossly woven , and ill set ,
With such fell cruelty were seen , their goads
Rushes in horror out to seek his death ?
Take love from it , you take the whole :
And let punch and tears be shed ,
Unto a wilder grief his soul it wrought ;
When fires were bright , and lamps beamed gay ,
His longing spirit homewards would return
Where rests peace that never dies .
To niels stretched the count his hand ,
Great the payment that he made him ;
Till the life-long thirst give o'er ?
Such answering passion in her heart could rouse ,
And in an age of faith grown frore
Which led him on till now was sorely dim ,
The mandate by her angry husband given ;
Who follows nature . never man ,
Deep lies the snow by the castle-wall .
' mid tears that none could quite command ,
From mouth to mouth through ages handles down .
The little voice rang thin :
And found the calm i looked for , or returned
Yet among the shades may he not take comfort from
And love which lead us towards the infinity
The shadow of sleep inexorable is cast ,
That holds the sultry , naked dead ,
The richest is the one we lose .
From him should pass away the influence fell ,
He marked the tilt of the pagan camp ,
To stand a trophy of his fame in war .
And while soft luxury made show to strike
Which oft a healing balm has brought ,
And light that took no thought for gloom ,
To see the coming year :
Sharp envy turned her wine to blood --
And must the church in helpless anguish moan ?
She owed him that to keep the balance straight .
Until it reached those barriers elysian
Life bent to breaking , while their great souls grew
But this exploit of no such weight i hold ,
The walls gave a shriek .
Without any spell he broke my wrath !
Fate cuts us all in marble , and the book
Answered in the words that follow :
The heads and leaders thither haste where stood
His slender frame and pallid aspect lay ,
The shades , ere yet our destined hour arrive .
They were made for men you see .
Like tipsy joy that reels with tossing head .
And some -- the sighing pines sway on
And heart that yearned and knew too late .
Nature keeps for flowering may .
Passing that way his benediction give .
For a brief space a holy silence fell ;
So much the thirst of honour fires the blood ;
Shouts of applause resound from side to side .
Forth bursting from imprisonment .
All other fate i could have borne ,
And all their swords are dipped in poison strong ,
Great displeasure i take lying alone in my bed .
Black chaos , blindly striving towards the word ?
As on his prey to waste a passing blow .
The clash comes sheer hereon ;
And such a fate to him would fall ,
Who 'd take the trouble to dispute with fools ?
Fails , and he sinks in mortal agony .
As for invading armies shoo ’d nothing to fear
Against such odds the tiny fleet set sail ;
And in our royall thrones , which lately stood
Which kept the country-folk alive ,
Never could evil enter thither ,
That we 'll be friends again ere summer dies .
The work is divided into four parts :
Goes to the feast that 's now provided .
Too heavy for mortals to bear .
With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing ,
Erskine 's english lines may follow .
That faced my three-plank bed ,
Into a deep and pleasant sleep is thrown .
Glory of youth glowed in his soul :
While nations , ere they pass 'd away ,
Horror , horror ! the fair town is burning ,
He reap 'd no common gains from both .
The which redounded to my good fortune .
I gave all comfort . i am very weary .
Whose steadfast faith yet never moved :
Hoped for better times to follow ;
And mould the world unto the scheme of god ,
To breathe the poems and hear the last red rose
More hearts are breaking in this world of ours
And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt .
Such health and gaiety of heart enjoy
New vigour from his rays obtain ,
While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke .
Deeper , darker grew the shadow ,
The song her charm 'd attention drew ,
She stuck the yellow wings .
And the days went by and winter came ,
Can make the place so dear ? "
And memories float from some forgotten place ,
Of vengeance that descended ;
There to get the lid in colors ,
Laughing from heart grown light .
And could not even raise a park ,
Under the burning abyss where abandoned it lay ,
It captive , and set kisses on its mouth ?
Silence held sway , the sin was mine ,
We caught the tread of dancing feet ,
That round my writhing soul wraps as a pall
Of the sad news thy servant now makes known !
Has seized and soiled my soul :
Part of the christian people should be set ,
From the deep fountains of her eyes there flow 'd
In port the bickering pennons show
Whom juno calls to high triumphant fame ,
That not dishonoured should thy soul go down
In tresses each his hair was bearing .
Her eyes have caught the dancing of her feet .
Till , fed with triumphs , you subside ,
And no proud honour to thyself redounds .
Perhaps it may turn out that all were right .
Who work their ransom out with tedious toil .
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow
Washed by the ceaseless tides of dark and light .
Enough the example that before me stands ;
And trample dim foreboding in the mire !
And overboard it pitches !
When these things following be done to our intent ,
As each brief line wherein her joy was told .
We were sad we could not follow
My soul intent allows no other thought
Strength 's wish to keep what strength has got !
Such names without a capital to spell .
Either a vengeful fury i should stalk ,
Return -- and spend your life in sports ,
Within the waves in softer murmurs glide ,
Must i take sample how the gods can love ?
And at her feet sink down with shame .
The eagles floated , struggling with the wind .
The ashes drew together , and of themselves
Through the golden gate where his loved have gone .
The hills swung open to the light ;
To fill the armada 's maw .
That with such perfumes fill the breeze ,
Wilt thou forgive that sin which i did shun
High confidence in her whose aid is lent
Slowly the darkness falls , the broken lands blend
That is a lonely grief that must go dry
Outrageously cornered by fate as poor crusoe ;
All lovely things that meet my sight ,
And find her fascinating ,
That that he took , and that was all .
And the big tear stood trembling in her eye .
Eyes that could melt as the dew , --
Had it brought my son beloved ,
In this our tale his part he plays .
And none can read the comment but myself ;
We take the arms that heaven supplies
That perishes , pledged to decay ,
Unconsciously he raised his cry ,
I made response to him with bashful forehead .
And days and space are between us drawn ?
Long vistas opening through the streets of dark ,
The feet of weird faced waves ran up the beach
The seas with swelling canvas cover 'd o'er ,
And another brave soul winged its passage ,
Their light by hers relief might find ;
In trance pantheia lay ,
These sounds i 'll strive to catch ;
And nightingales took up the strain .
And stood up firm for " right divine ; "
Of heaven 's own glory stamped upon its work ?
O'er this wide globe what darkness broods ,
Divers births of godheads find one death appointed ,
Of passion in me that strove up and stood
That pleasure fills with tears and feeds from flowers ,
Or rather found that it was all a lie .
The moon be wrapped in gloomy pall ,
The gifts we tender , and our names declare
Singing , she wrought , and her merry glee
Yet from his face flashed lightning on the land ,
But would not change my sadness for a life
And they patiently follow wherever he goes .
Upon her wings presents the god unshorn .
Lies buried there , no truth thereof we find ,
The schoolhouse stood with pines about
And honorable wounds from battle brought .
To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark 'd !
Love 's message , blown on every wind ,
Now through their breasts the chilly tremors glide ,
And fill me with a buoyant doubt .
Had felt her sorrow as her own .
To the gold gems of afric , bound
Where tempests gather o'er our way ,
And party feuds forgot , joined to agree
From the rude rock the side-walls sprung ;
And there perfect quiet and rest thou shalt gain —
It makes my heart feel glad ,
Their darts flew equal , and the people fell ;
And the high gods fell humanly in love .
No brothers gave relief ;
For the quick spring spirit urges .
And he was moved by all that loveliness
Bring wine to quench the fire !
That wrapped the dingy town .
I long have had a quarrel set with time
Or what the grace of heaven 's designs explain !
Brings a third of magic import .
Forced back my scream into my chest ,
Wherefrom the snows of duty flushed to rose ,
Filled the hushed , rustling stillness of the wood ?
Tom whiled the languid hours away
Puff 'd gently back the warm assailing breeze .
" what means this frantic grief ? "
And atheism and religion take their turns ;
How come to resurrection without death ?
For i was sunk in silence -- lost
Let 's make it full up by our sport .
Ere clocks and watches came their way .
Lay the monster mishe-nahma ,
Then , springing towards a grove that spread
Put life and mettle in their heels .
Making thy peace with heaven for some late fault ,
Till eve bring rest when other good things pass .
Smoking flesh the thresher washed down fast ,
The accustomed smile comes up to call ,
But see how oft ambitious aims are crossed ,
His fortune came to nothing , all she got
Suit with the splendor that surrounds a king ,
Seized with the horrors of the world to come .
And the length of night overtook them distant
Dim-backward as i cast my view ,
We made a turkish merchantman our prey ,
When overcome by gentle sleep , to rest ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
And strange swift eyes where the soul sits free .
Let not thy heart with fear be filled ;
When life was fled away ,
My robbed hands lay death 's captive ,
Till thou appears well struck with years ,
Thy love within my soul doth burn !
Since living virtue is with envy cursed ,
The death of woe , spaed long ago ,
Straight to her own white-budding bosom went .
For new love sees , here
And so two citizens who take the air ,
These bold rinaldo broke and overthrew ;
To battle came the carthaginian host ,
The burning billows surged and rolled ,
Little sorrows sit and weep .
So years went on till jimmy was a lad
And no one passes any judgment thereupon :
She drew from them what they derived from heaven .
Kind nature 's care had given his share
Would ' st thou the pangs of guilt assuage ?
Giving his lust the sacred name of love ;
While all the wrath within him made him grey .
From what once lovely lip it springs unseen !
A hundred chambers , where the shadows lie
Enchanting daughter , thus the silence broke .
Interprets , all it knows not into ill .
Down the marble aisle they bore him ,
And , being thus coupled with full restitution ,
That his brave look with awful boldness filled .
Is this the justice which on earth we find ?
The trampled steel that springs ;
When , while the world was clad in flowers ,
Which brought us hither ,
Working your will with the stroke of a pen ?
And i myself on a swiftly tilting planet
The tears that down their faces rolled ,
This found i true by proof , hearing that spirit
To show their deadly rage .
As far as ball players goes , at least ,
Thy sacrificial wine we press ;
From her fond eyes summoned to join the array
And we , too , find the fighting sweet ;
Men 's secret thoughts that most concealed lie
' these omens ; render vain this prophecy ,
Thou lovest to bear the sweet melodious sound
While circling time moves round in an eternal sphere .
When change itself can give no more ,
Who was absorbed in duty ; and the mother
This fancied medicine heightens the disease .
And a terrible stillness came :
To dew-eyed pity brought the tear
See youth commence and age depart ,
Friendship in either will bear equall share .
After one comes two ,
By beauties which the heavens displayed ;
His life-blood as the warrior sank .
And they felt past handlers clutch them ,
In the brief lines that hurrying time can give ;
Her breath coming quick as if all but spent .
His giant foe no answer made ,
Where nature stows away her loveliness .
The hour arrived , no matter where :
Now did the hour of sweet repast arrive ,
Not fit to come into my degree ,
Forth as the long-armed hero went ,
And old warehouses poured their purple shadows
Thrice shall the morn arise ; a flight of bombs
Freedom called , and called in vain .
And all within and out , she bore away ;
In tears , or sternly strive to conquer grief ?
The troops pursue their leaders with delight ,
Smote the province house with terror , struck the
Lived on , nor from their memories drave
The crackling vessels burst ; hoarse groans arise ,
And one long rolling fire of triumph run
Her undecisive scales . in this she lays
It is not aught that seeks reward --
Which stretched before me , lifeless , and the stream
Coroner merival took the hundred letters
With voices of the wood that drones .
Tingling frost falls through the air ;
His days in penance rites he spent ,
To indicate the death she met . who saw her
The king ’s example all his greeks pursue .
His bristling beard just rising in its might ,
I looked throughout the vista stretched between
Or touch the magic chords .
Which truth and falsehood seek alike with fear ,
Of him who held in life a dozen thrones ;
Who stand ' st among the nations now
And pass not crownless to persephone .
Of powerless hate , with tenfold flames conspire ;
Him did the winds and waves drive hither . him
That seize ye and make fast with thoughts enduring .
When scarce his chirping bill had broke the shell .
Courage came to you with your boyhood 's grace
As though it feared to be too soon forgot
A shadow of annoyance set at naught ,
Of a heart to be given , --
Who sought and found the truth ,
The couple made their wedding as they might ;
So he sought shelter till the morning dawn ,
The spanish balls came whizzing fast , --
The blow has fallen , yet i can recall
Swift to the monarch ’s hall he drew ,
But god bath led my dear ones on ,
Your lightest touch went thrilling ; and began
Thy feet she leads to glittering peaks , while mine
A sigh or tear can not that boon impart ,
The laugh runs loud ,
My flaring heart gave plenty light ,
The frozen deeps may break their iron bands ,
Such rage will typhon make boil over
Yet 't is my first that tells us now
The night comes down on a restless deck , --
Bound , and to torment sent before their time .
Sure the worst pang the lover feels !
That are withered now and lost ;
There to perish by judgment meet ,
The years that through my portals come and go .
He said : experienced merion took the word ;
And forms his shelter from the tempest 's power
With hope 's tear-drops to blend ,
The gods of greece stand marble-pale
Each other 's shadow see
And roughness o’er his skin was spread .
And save thy soul from coming woe .
And press them to the heart of love ;
Which make life worth enjoying .
When god made music through them , could but speak
To the nourishment recently taken ,
Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead :
Had lately stirred to wild unrest .
And a fear i could not name ,
He vents his fury and inflames the crowd :
My mother placed me servant to a lord ,
Death holds the vale as his demesne ,
And upon us the crime is laid . ”
Then your courage should appear ;
Though it should ring with clash of steel ,
( it is a soul that struggles so . )
The spirits of the seasons seem to stand .
" and these wings , lying darkly now ,
And slow the hands that carry on ,
In hector ’s blood his vengeance shall enjoy ,
Whose thoughts , whose deeds find rest in you ,
The very charms it tries to hold ,
This cause made him who in his fury shared ,
Which made , alas ! sad month of may .
Wearily i track my pathway ,
And rocks and mountain peaks , they stood .
Mark how the blood of caesar followed it ,
He knows dreams never kept their promise yet .
To this the queen her just dislike express 'd :
Jove gave the signal of success to troy .
Where the sun has sunk to sleep .
Revolving i should feel the dismal joustings .
This question put i ; and he answered me :
First came thy passion 's flood and poured around her
About the trees my arms i wound ;
As march turns april , and the hours bring
While seas to chafe of foam are beaten ,
And it spoke the words which follow :
Made sure that his scent had failed the pack ,
The universe unfolds ; all properties
That i might once more reach that plain
Our gain we held . up flamed the sun .
Feel i not always her distress ?
But seldom meet a change ; think you a tear
To be the cheese i hollowed .
When he speeded her parting soul .
Then rush 'd the steed , to battle driven ;
But through the dews of kindness beamed ,
One night to drive his cares away
That i could read from his brow and bearing --
The ribbon of road ran straight ahead ;
His babbling tongue his ruin wrought ; and chang 'd
To mourn for youth we 're not inclined ;
Then came a cry , a groan ,
Through the fair city took his way .
He lost his all be bein ' rash !
Though now the sun has mounted high
The light of her sprang and sank :
To me alone there came a thought of grief :
God heard the prayer ; his answer came --
To italy came charles , and for amends
How foolish they whose faith is fixed upon
And thus with gentle words addressed :
Where life found refuge or despair a grave . "
Thy mortal passage when it comes . ascend
But flung his gaze back with a fearless eye ,
Amid the mountains steep so laid and placed
To the forbidden field he takes his flight ,
Bearing away from the vacant shore .
And dawn 's grey eyes were troubled grey ;
Through the day smeared in sooty smoke
Not to be followed ! falls the cloud again ;
To my soul now approaches awakening ,
Beth gave a fearful shriek --
But all of the things that belong to the day
Till god 's own smile came out :
Green glow pours down . the houses ,
Rocks and trees make strange grimaces ,
And the green scene goes on the instant blind --
The mournful voice sings on ,
And to endurance isabel inclined ;
That i laid by in lavender so sweet ,
To whom the offering to bear .
His arms about his friend he threw :
The pine-tops rocked before the evening breeze
A land breeze shook the shrouds ,
The wind is rising ; it seizes and shakes
Ere yet his heavy blows had ceased to fly ,
With mutiny had fired the train ,
I have no stay . only obedience holds : --
Give a single spark , my husband ,
" give us bright though broken rays ,
The young life comes , bound to the cruel rocks
And pity took me which were more than love ,
Stilling the woodland singer 's note ,
Heard the trumpet-echoes rolling
Came a stone with rainbow-colors .
As the wide earth unfolds thee .
And lost in jungles of confusing creeds ,
Soon shalt thou feel the rein 's control ,
So meanly passes , that all other lots
The mingling notes came soften 'd from below ;
As comes the smile to the lips ,
Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise ,
The brotherhood of nations met .
The army i resolve to lead . ”
The injian ocean sets an ' smiles ,
The verse that told his grief , renewed :
Or of revived adonis or renowned
Raised the broken heart above ,
Whence neither silence , nor plain outcries flew :
To fetch delights for luxury at home :
Thus to close the path of bleeding ,
Of heaving hulls and burying beaks .
In yon dark niche ? before his steps can gain
And other that which the soul keeps entire ;
And never breathe a word about your loss ;
Had tinged more deeply , as it flowed ,
But an image rose in his heated brain ,
Down her throat did rush each snake .
Yet appear to give no shock
Drew nearer , how our downward course we wound .
And many a doubt perplexed him as he wrought .
The ploughman ran and gave a hearty shout ,
A chance but chance may lead where i may meet
Hath brought them to wo mysfortune and damage
The phantom armies marching go !
Each one has got its popper 's nose !
A footstep seem 'd to fall beside her path ,
But from its song is gone a note i heard
The sinking stone at first a circle makes ;
While the wavelets whispered " welcome ! "
And reach that summer of two years ago
For humankind stirred in her gentle heart ,
I 'll gladly work my way through life ;
Tut ! bah ! we take as another case --
And yet i dare not lift the voice
Sorrow was there made fair ,
Loud , deep , and lang the thunder bellowed :
And give the goddess to adoring day !
And fain would lure or scare off fate
To where the wild , mad rapids run ,
Will turn to pity thy forsaken son ,
" they ai n't no tears shed over him
And i bring to god no record
The power to make our own supplies ;
Which made haworth folk to tremble .
God in externals could not place content .
So swiftly will life 's race be run .
When human rights are staked and won .
Now summon all the fury of your might !
Our light , from god himself the rushing fire ?
And hours shall give a future to their past ?
Her rippling laughter floated through the room ,
And breaking waves in a rhythmic dance ensue ;
How husbands make love to their wives
Child of mine you fill me with anguish ,
How jesus ' blood for your redemption flows .
It hath caught a touch of sadness ,
There stirred and beat a golden glow
Beyond the eastern road that leads to wu .
Some breast that glows with virtues all divine ;
In stormy pride to lay full low ;
And will drive away their care , --
Till the last dear companion drops smiling away ?
My heartstrings almost broke ,
I see . what i admire
He gave a gasp and thought to run ,
Down the hurrying world went i ;
My lord 's protecting hand alone would raise
He gave him the vision of prophet and priest ,
To try and find a snug retreat .
But in the german tongue held he discourse
What were these gales of which the stories told ?
That filled the prisons and the nameless graves ,
Peace charmed the street beneath her feet ,
The distance widened like the sky ,
And here is a kiss for the treasure that lies
And all at once their breath drew in
And lay his life beside the other sinners .
Reason shall steer , and shall disarm the gale .
And celtic feuds are lost today ....
Nor winds that the thunder bestrides ;
Then up she took her little crook ,
Their standards bear .
Love her , o thou rash lost soul !
Drew all eyes on him , giving them to guess
Take care thy lofty powers be wisely used .
The sweets of a swinging full-blown rose ,
Serpents and fiends , the conflict dare .
In regions where his maker shed his blood ,
Can hold a winking light o ' love
In such words as these addressed her :
Bravely strove the young soldier to look in the face
Nature mocks both , and wit still keeps ado :
As fate does lead or draw us ; none ,
His red eyes showed his wrathful mood .
His form , dilating , swelled and rose .
To be drawn upward to the infinite --
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn ;
No mind of man hath found the perfect truth ,
And of his hurts did tell .
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth ,
The brownies never go astray ,
Who burst the sinner 's yoke . "
I see her eyes shine through the mist ;
To walk and pass our long love 's day .
Of nature , and not fill the world at once
New meaning every hour i see ;
But a zigzag fire leapt in our sockets
Their armies and engines on the walls they spread ,
Where olive-trees make tender the blue sky
I found what gall beneath thy sweetness lay . "
And called to the stars to give him light ,
Through the land where the dead dreams go ...
Then thou shalt find what grateful souls can do .
She sank within my arms , and cried ,
To share awhile the labours of his guard ;
The full fruition of these hopes that move --
For her alone my fervent ardour burn 'd .
And wondered when i made reply ,
Where maids have spent their hours .
Whose cry still hangs and hovers
The season when the rain descends .
" and with unusual rapture sings ;
Where twilight gathers , wan and gray ,
One made reply which went to william 's heart ,
And shakes wrought dice-cups in pagan temples ,
Its calm day darkened , and its music gone ;
Folded in sleep , as if its soul had gone
So when the furious billows raging beat
With steadfast gaze to scan my master 's face ,
Laid on the brow of the dusky night ,
When a sunny day is given !
So her warm blood , flowing beneath the kiss ,
And friendship oft his numbers move ;
" his song was only living aloud ,
Peace and heaven lie all about us .
But what d'you think had followed ? --
Which brought us hither ,
And with the thought of god imbued .
The blood of children smoked on earth ;
Died -- and took the finest grave .
So year by year the music rolled afar ,
Or stir thy gentle vows of faith in me :
Of all things that go utterly to death
Which made the haworth folk to tremble .
If love , which doth all things subdue ,
The myriad wonders art hath wrought
Even gods must yield -- religions take their turn :
Seasons revolved ; and saw the great achilles ,
Where hissing snakes run to the flood below .
Shall they sink in death 's terrors nocturnal ,
And time was caught in a glistening pattern ,
To show a heart grief-rent ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
Cold winter 's ice is fled and gone ,
That leaves a doubt of softness there ,
And luminous white eyelids tremulously slips ,
Learn 'd things , that to his victory gave rise
That all things have to go
And with new fervor filled the hearts of men ,
The wanton winding dance he traces .
Restless with throbbing hopes , with thwarted aims ,
When my heart failed -- the spell was broken --
Are chas 'd by certainty , and terror turn 'd
Wild beats my heart to trace your steps ,
Appeal unto the laws of mine own nation !
First made the nursery rhyme .
Thither comes wisdom from the thrones of earth ,
And force me to a smile .
Yet sure when the world shall awaken ,
Learn 'd sages tell why all these whims arose ,
And the chilly clouds are hurrying away
I fix my soul on chloe 's eyes .
And the murmuring pines sing a soft lullaby .
The comfort of thy strengthening love ,
Had melted , and fresh winds began to blow ,
And thus made way for liberty .
Though happiness around thee lay ,
Now christmas comes , 't is fit that we
Dream that in her absorbed my heart must rest ;
No caverned hermit rests self-satisfied :
The only one ; then tears my grief confess .
Haste , join your forces ; from the gloomy grave
Such as i own i entertain a dread of ,
Grew glazed in death there came in them a gleam
The new king 's praises fill the land .
In this wise then my leader made reply .
" this river does not see the naked sky ,
That onward came some space from whence i stood .
And the storm has ceased to blow .
Or where your sad and gentle reveries pass
Thy foeman came in wrath and pride ,
Beneath her feet the waves swept to and fro .
The brave epeians gave my glory way ,
Which others often show for pride ,
Against the wind there fights the eternal fire .
As soon the rooted oaks would fly
The light that , flashing through the immeasurable ,
As if his spots would give contagious fevers !
Shall in the life to come have bliss ;
Seek with thine eyes to pierce this crystal sphere :
So psyche felt , as sinking on the ground
That all find rest who will obey
There might still misfortune find thee ,
There where the mountain-side folds back
While tumbling brown , the burn comes down ,
Unknown is wavering fear or dread of death .
The warm quick tears do run :
And lead thy way with heavenly augury :
Yet when thunder roared _ too _ loudly
_ break your bonds , britain _ !
Of sensual life , bringing contrariousness
The all-prevailing fee lay nigh ,
Content , thereafter , would i meet my fate .
From the loathed object every sight shall turn ,
To carry burdens on your backs forever .
All the grapevine swings are curling
We weave the marriage-veils of a queen .
And breathe a prayer for his soul .
Till sleep takes place of weariness .
The whiteness it reflects from god ,
The crooked was straight and the rough made plain ,
Recklessly we sought for vengeance ,
What trap can hold such cats ? the romany
From a foul spirit dimmed his eyes --
Heard in his infant , happy years gone by .
But for comedy these never make use of themselves .
A morning full of happiness any boy may find
Bradamant made the worthless traitor bleed ;
Tears will gather hot and blinding
There comes a tremor in the drops , and fast
And nocht remained but an infernal smell
Could it be so ? my heart stood still .
How all that water , slipped beneath the bridges ,
To fight the battles of the lord !
To make which marriage first was made ?
What friendly voices tell --
That sent into pale cheeks the blood ,
A coon-song gently strikes the ear ,
Gay epilogue will shine where prologue fails --
Captive led by beauty 's power ,
For lo ! the sense thereof is passing sweet .
Of one whose naked soul stood clad in love ,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim ;
Wherein so many sufferers met their fate ,
He for jerusalem was bound by vow .
To see what my black hen doth lay .
A worthier match i give thee in exchange ;
The shadow that he made .
Thou shalt not bow to graven images
Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies :
Give him poetic place again ,
“ their poverty on souls unmurmuring weigh 'd .
The whirling ways of stars that pass --
Like sparks of fire above the wavering grass ,
The other fixed his gaze upon the light ,
In a reaped , rich harvest of grief .
Who the blest gospel 's peaceful page explore ,
You almost feel the date ,
Thou art not dead , o sweet lost melody ,
My life shall pass as pleasant there
Where ellen 's hand had taught to twine
And rivers glide , and healthy breezes blow .
From his footprints flowed a river ,
Of human gloom are lost against the gleam
He turned to meet his fate ,
I 'll thole the doom that lays me dead ,
That can inform the mind or mend the heart ,
He that turned to stone the giant ,
The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth
The solid oaks forget their strength , and strew
Take heed lest his beams fall on you ,
Authoritative of that elder , sprang
Where i obscurely pass my careless days ,
That all the lights are gathered in your eyes ,
She manna thole the marriage tether ,
In one there grew an alsace rose ,
White over with its flowers -- the grass that lay
Beneath the moon which links his thoughts with home .
To the ashes whence it came .
And martyrs that embrace the fire
Round come the race-horses early at work .
And they lighted a torch of hope and intuition
One kiss to the eagle he gave .
Within me i could in just numbers cast .
Than he who joys it following thee ;
A fellow made of genuine flesh and blood
There is no truce to this drawn battle ,
Where the trembling indian brings
" thou hast then all the solace death allows ,
Guess of what my songs are spun ,
The season for the maidens ' dance drew nigh ,
In days of danger courage gave unbounded .
From the high tree the blossom wavering fell ,
For when her trouble came , and darkness pressed ,
You made your footpath by life 's flowers ,
Answered in the words that follow :
By mourning beauty crowned ! "
Above a world that burns ,
The record of his life must stand .
To the sad ear of grief from distance blown ;
He made his soul go upward
On monsters that make boil the sea ,
From gods of heaven and fiends secured .
The enchantments that recall the dead to life .
Not a shilling left to him !
My mercy shall attend .
Oh , bring again my heart 's content ,
Oh , ponder what it means !
Yet unto the word he gave i cling ,
The neighbour shades wear , and what forms are seen
Which monster made it first and next a prey .
Of the lot that lies before thee ,
Dimension 'd equal to his size , express 'd
But if that blood by faith 's applied ,
That is , to thy obedience ; therein stand .
That hides the " strangers ' pew , "
The road runs rough and silent , lined
That comes soft creeping o'er the flowery field ,
In him the light of hope began to peer
One day his spirits sank extremely low --
But came with less of fear ,
Where a solitary sunbeam might have strayed ,
As autumn to winter resigns the pale year .
If wealth be gone , and kingdom lost ,
When earth lay still beneath a waning moon .
The thick sobs choking in his breast ;
The doomed one drew his breath .
And meet with simple hope and trust
On whose sole arm hung victory .
And he loudly read from the law a clause ,
It seeks its own life-blood to drain ,
The castle of martha was wrapped in fire ,
I 'll set my foot in a bottomless ship ,
Where man is made the plaything of taman ,
Such an one as women draw away from
His pleasures with thee wrought .
Their standards planted ; and the trumpet clang
And the good south wind still blew behind ,
She gives thee ire , by which not courage flies
Yet from the places where it used to lie ,
Thy tears shall idly soak the sullen shores :
His eager mind reached for it and took hold .
Not distant , on the happy coast she stood .
The trees their mournful branches lift aloft :
But take it : if the smack is sour ,
Even so you fluttered , followed , floated ,
Their gathered hate and crowding darts oppose .
I thank you for the pleasure you have given ;
That give but emptiness they served to hide .
Was touched with lines of beauty , till it grew
A heart that finds the best in every man ;
Almost three years were ended ; when there came
No hint i see of damning ;
Not with the anguish of hearts that are breaking
But these sharp questionings mean strife , and strife
As though it strove to utter that one word ,
And give the war-cry wild and free
And broke the heaving ranks of battle !
All hues and forms , combining with one tone
Then -- leaving his blessing upon each brow --
And seek the angelic image to adore ,
Of silver hue the shining waters run .
What joy to breathe the morning air ,
Though banded europe stood her foes -
Nor any breezes blow so light .
As though the weeping had not eased the pain .
And voices in her rising storm ;
Darkness about her swirled , but , with a fierce
The wicked love he to that lady bore .
Her rivers run ; her hills and meadows fair ,
Ah ! made for earth 's delight , yet such
Should there come the best of suitors ,
It takes the world 's eternal wars ,
And now , after long years , it comes
Year after year will pass away and seem
This old te deum , rustic rites attending ,
Still fortitude and hope shall keep the field ;
The loftiest of life upheld by death ,
The nearer heaven they rise ,
But lost , dissolved in thy superior rays ,
Since , winter gone , the sun in dappled sky
I love to lay me by their side
His mistress , who had followed fast ,
And never his love could see , --
There charge our mother , that she go direct ,
Astonished i made answer ,
How nature works in field and dell !
Earth helped him with the cry of blood . _
Eastward the gradual dawn prevails
The birds upon the shore were cast .
And oft i catch them smiling as they pass ,
Than served to make the loathing sense a bond
Of strength : and gave no light to lead :
Though in her ear love sings a song sublime ,
A sound came from the land ;
Of grace hath come , without baptismal rites
The shock of it made me settle down
Retained my nature -- but he shaped
It made him take a knot !
The blow that blighted hopes have felt ) --
The heart that would have leaped for joy --
Pat as a sum in division it goes --
Faith alone can interpret life , and the heart
He also found that he had lost his dinner .
Which with the words came then and there ;
My manhood calls its brother !
Go on , to flourish while thy paintings fade .
Of six months back , and comes too late .
A wet yew-trunk flashed the peel
Praying still , by faith sustained :
Trees on their path cast densest shade ,
Where dreaming nature fills
This desolating radiance cast by swords
These hung as honours o'er thy grave ;
By tales of dirt and danger fondly thrilled .
Hath left me broken-hearted .
As far as fair augusta 's buildings reach ,
Stabbing and wounding his soul each day ,
Their own sweet bloom regain .
When sacrifice absolved our earth .
And the cherry blossoms burst with snow ,
White woman that passion has worn
May find as dear a nurse at need ,
His skilful suit , which leaves her free ,
That keep initiation 's holy rite ,
Thine evermore ; youth mingled with thy youth ,
Be valour , prudence both united here ,
Where water-lilies spread their oily leaves ,
Find time to breathe again , replace in haste
Milton gives a similar couch to adam and eve .
Kindled within his breast the love of fame ,
Too lofty for language to reach .
Which says that though young love is strong ,
The hours slid fast , as hours will ,
Hot july brings cooling showers ,
Seen by the light which penance brings .
With slackened sail she feels the tide ,
The tempest may madly rage without ,
To bind faith to her , herself bound .
To whom shall i give glory
All night it lay an ice-drop there ,
Between her lips the breath was blown as fire ,
That fills religion 's last retreat :
To see how together these yeomen went ,
Like kings , we lose the conquests gained before ,
Her garden 's fence white lifted
So she went to gaze around her ,
And yet your touch upon them will not pass .
Only , as the years went by --
Till tearful terror , struggling into might ,
And swelling clusters bend the curling vines :
See the whole vision be made manifest .
While chief baron ear sat to balance the laws ,
In countless numbers stand , at milking-time ,
That with thy glory comes to cheer
And from the moss white lilies rise ,
Then nigh the place of battle drew
Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe ,
Where is laid the lord arisen ?
The brazen shield which once great abas bore ,
And blew the sparklings into deadly flames ;
Hath made the sinner 's peace with god .
Or sleeping , walk a restless world of dreams .
Which shows how deep are all of our desires ;
And i hear his bird heart beat its story ,
In charity 's espousals are made one .
For fear would draw behind .
The limbs she bore and cherished tenderly ,
Is slowly strangled by remorseless pain :
Would i tear me from her boldly ,
One honest jack would make amends for all . "
Again , it comes in full harmonious swell ,
Love flew to me , love fled from you .
O bid my feeling heart expand
Beside it sits the soul
Loud with ancestral shame there came the bleak
A mournful feud alive , which else would die .
But the balm of his breath hath healed .
Takes pleasure in a net , by cunning hands
Where the great wall round china goes ,
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
Which showed alike thy french and sense ; --
In after times , a ring they made ,
The noble frenzy feels that mars inspires
Is never flushed by blight or bloom ,
To give rest unto the roaming ,
Breakfast prepared , and charged their cups with wine .
Then heaven appear 'd to shed its kindly rays :
Passed his life in sweet contentment ,
Thy rosy lips still wear a smile
The moon that saw gethsemane ,
That followed mother eve 's unlucky apple ,
A million worlds leapt into radiant light !
While moons and stars their courses run ,
The paths that round it pass .
Our hearts are made glad when we feel thee advance
When noon 's fierce sun the breeze hath laid ,
And bring us nearer to the final day
She plants the forest , pours the flood ;
Which holds fast other pleasures great and small .
Crimson the armour ran with blood of men .
He sprung the gun and he was slain ,
From moslem hands did strive to clutch
So long thy honoured name and praise shall last .
As a sick child waking sees
" when virtue only could support the fray
And the salt sea it came in .
Grinds all things meet for his transforming fire ,
He brings a train of brighter years :
Of bitter memory that stings and glows .
Silently mix , and make an unseen stay :
With many a wound that often back them sent ,
To take a lonely way .
Scarcely the year had flown . one night
Where move the powers in whose dread hands may be
From the fields came corn in plenty ,
That sweet spring comes to him .
I wish the times would change their cry
Thy genius fondly stoops to softer themes ,
That screaming parrot makes my blood run cold .
Yours came but from the breaking of a glass ,
Wearied himself , one gave himself to ease ;
Soft 's the band that winds the rose ;
By their own fears made bold ,
Such causeless fears when coward minds do take ,
And mellowed day comes o'er the place ,
Make haste before a wasting life is gone !
Since last we looked upon its haunting grace .
Nor lose ten tickings of thy watch ,
With it mounts her own fair face ,
In bitter hate of blood in fury spilled ;
He fought with numbers , and made numbers yield .
They scarcely need give you a moment of pain :
Her truth and constancy , which bind
Some semblance that their reverence might claim .
And like a callow eagle spreads its wings ,
On tender feet that scarcely bow the grass ,
So when aloft the gold moon broke ,
Burns , that the sunset catches .
Nobody weighed the baby 's smile ,
Our andy 's gone to battle now
At last one night it chanced
A monster woe lies in my breast ,
Thy phantasms grope and shiver ,
When her waking thoughts through the darkness grew
But still as wilder blew the wind ,
And wasted heart there leaped a flame and caught
Produce great persons , the rest follows .
What fort against cupidity can hold ?
That the predictions he had given were true ,
That drives the vast and energetic earth .
Let not that wisdom idly fall .
That lay in the house that jack built .
" what , though so many years are gone ,
Then herself was brought to weeping ,
And tampered with his changing mood .
From thee the violet steals its breath in may ,
Made perfect , a great joy and trembling took me
Lest i fall unawares before the people ,
The infant colony sought no defence
All the songs i give you
Was given the charge of a young foreign knight ,
And loathe the life i may not leave ,
The glistening dewdrops hang on bending flowers ,
But with the winds their prayers mixed ; far away
So if the truth can not make her white ,
't was touching that his gaze was set
Go -- take refreshment now that we may march
The gracious odors that her garments shed .
It came through the silent night ,
At length the awful revelation came ,
And a cold chill shivered across the lake .
Nor by division was vermilion made . "
Thus addressed his fleeing people :
That follows the fall of the year .
They bring you memories of old village faces ,
The king of day mounts the ethereal height ,
Each winding path . and sweet youth ’s memories fell
Ye sages , who shine in my verse ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
By fortune , till her native realm was lost .
Came the happy bells ' refrain .
To italy came charles , and for amends
To ráma next made known his wife ,
But godlike his unwearied bounty flows ,
For extravagance makes all his assets away .
Which bharadvája pointed out ,
On this altar 's steps were laid
All through the garden , drifts of skirling leaves
With happy face of plenteous ease possessed ,
And all birds ' passion-plays that sprinkle dew
And to my heart such kindly courage ran ,
His wrath was turned to swearing .
Or the pale moon embraced you with her beams --
And helps his wit .
Following my spotless guide , i stood apart ,
His eldest hope in arms to ilion came ,
Nations have looked and seen the fate of kings ,
Ah , take the season and have done ,
Sudden there burst a fearful cry ,
May let in light , and how the smallest bird
Burned steadily , as fire when the wind dies .
And faith remembers promise ,
And felt that all was well .
He fought with lance while his good lance stood ;
It guided home the plunging boats
And the summers go by .
A summer night , whose shadow falls
" i am here to time , you see ;
" who put the french to rout ;
And as she fetched breath , away he skips ,
Floating about my heart , which only comes
Your drooping eyes with soft impression seize ;
Reproach is cheap . easily might we cast
Fail in the combat , and few blows resist ;
Horribly serpents coiled with flickering tongues .
And the sweet year before thee lies ,
Heroic trump should in her praise be wound .
At length collecting , zeinab turned her eyes
That should mean other gifts than bags of gold ,
The fragments birds , that mount through middle sky .
And streams of lightning pour down far and near .
An ' i thank my stars i took to cricket
When days were gane and months were run ,
Beneath high walls we flow in the sun together .
That rang unheard through the stormy sky .
Across the sky a glittering path have worn .
Where they who seethed were raising loud lament .
Then , crouched within , ulysses waxed afraid ,
And climbing shakes his dewy wings ,
Hope 's airy prospects banish griefs ,
The white procession through the moonlight streamed
He looked , behind him lay the bank :
Sigh for the big fool 's paradise to come .
( where many others would have hatred sworn )
That fills the circuit of the world around ;
Blisters of love , wherewith they swell .
The loneliness that dwells inside .
Man 's works shall follow him !
The past is closed as with division great
The name of worth will stand ,
To battle , a fair breeze broke out anew ,
And crude serpents chased in silver
Which makes the creature we name brute
In the weight of cold lead they respectively carry .
~ perhaps the men will find me fair ! ~
Again his pulses beat , his spirits rise ;
Like the waves that break along the shore ,
If once your vessels catch the trojan fire ?
Here justice holds us prison 'd , hand and foot
And strip themselves to make you gay :
Perhaps , when christmas brought the holy guest ,
The virtuous path before him set .
That at a glance betray this horrid treason .
Innumerable voices , rising , falling .
To my sage counsel therefore did i turn .
The burden of the months he scarce can bear ;
And the sixpence went for wine .
And they whose firm endurance gained
Let streaming floods their hastie courses stay ,
And the sea rises higher .
As in a lottery-wheel are shook .
But not to tell of good or evil luck ,
With jesus , ere his flight he take ,
Weeds of forgetfulness soon choke the way ;
As echoing back another 's bliss ;
Vengeance to god alone belongs ;
Or wakes the spectral forms of woe and crime ,
For ony wife i see ;
Gleam on a chaos that startles and scares !
And beauty came like the setting sun .
Our gracious king gets all he wants , --
The easiest port and fairest bloom i bore --
It breaks in thunder and the whirlwind 's roar
When dark misfortune comes and woe ,
To shadow forth thy strain of woe ,
Or a sigh came double ,
A gloom that gathers silence looms more closely ,
A thought of joy that blossomed into being
The gloomy volumes , pierced with light , divide .
Nor make them heed you , dead or living .
Wainamoinen thus makes answer :
That 's the first-cabin comfort i secure :
Men , this it becomes to bury in darkness .
And clashing wars spun hecate round
Your over-confidence had led
It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction ,
Courage take , and fly her coldly ,
Is freedom 's altar fashioned so ?
" or spent in reading , or in leisure ;
( and smell came up from those foul openings
May he find a place for the tears !
Abundance reigns ; and comfort sweetly flows ;
Christmas comes but once a year .
Pay you for the love you gave .
He thundered with a voice of fear :
And her heart was touched with pity
No peace , no comfort could i find ,
The blessings which to her we owe !
I set my trap , built round it fence ,
Of diti sprang the daityas : fame
Stirs the wavy coverlet
Flame lit on their hair ,
Even the shadows , that they throw
Another as sweet and as shining comes on .
His name shone bright through blood and pain ,
They had gone but little distance ,
Death now stares them in the face ;
Shall twine their glittering hair in mournful braids . "
Its power was felt ; and while my eye
But wherefore linger on those days of peace ?
A wreath reflecting of eternal beams .
And we will make you glad with good remembrance .
And near me rush the healing waters out ,
Within , two lovers linked innocently
They follow thee , -- and they abhor
But sorrow 's sel ' wears past , john ,
Farther than sight can follow .
Erring as fits the mother . some will say
That drew others ' grief so near .
Sleep will come when thou art fled ;
To thine , which now absorbs within its sphere
From us by the blast thou art drifted ,
And waned the antique light prometheus brought ,
Turned lakshmaṇ ’s prudent speech aside
For this the day was made .
And voices rise and smiles grow broader ,
To such entreaty answer thus was made :
By her is pity sought ?
The blast which cold november sends ,
And a smoke when his dry day is gone .
The sumachs spread their fire ;
He brought his soul , expectant and elate ,
The glorious sage his way pursued
Take this lesson for thy guide , --
And give you half my fortune too . }
For great round organ tones that rise and fall ,
An angel in a dream brought cheer :
And soon the breath of morning came and fanned
To blast the fury of oppressive might ,
Cast himself headlong downward in his fear :
Now to his home remains they bear ,
To lift the bright disguise ,
As that the old world thought it fit
The blowing rose , the maiden 's mouth ,
Of a diviner purity than comes
Where the hedges sound their lyres ;
For thee through hell 's eternal dungeons stray :
My scolding wife has gone among the rest . "
This painted falsehood , this most damned lie ,
And sunk and sad was she !
She a long season wandered through the world .
At hector ’s breast a chosen arrow draws :
Save that the growing trees so thick were set ,
That 's newly sprung in june ;
The ground-pine curled its pretty wreath ,
And fortune leading on , and favouring fates ,
A holier silence thrills and overawes ;
And faint , worn , bleeding , hailed at last
Beseech her to take me in pity ,
Her heart was troubled yet comforted ,
Is founded every virtue , came to thee . "
He found his wife and children overjoyed
That mocks the tear it forced to flow ;
Take heed , that in thy verse
Suffers worse pain where thicker fumes arise ;
Bring less of bloom than in days gone by ?
For you are bound to tell the truth ,
Pondered deeply and reflected
And rode triumphant through the civil broil .
But the god fostering her chilled hand ,
And the soft babble of their talk comes to her
I felt the love he once inspired ?
He set a shrine , all holy and possessed
And follow 'd quaking where the specter led .
Say what strange motive , goddess ! could compel
Achilles suffer 'd not to share the fight .
The blame of falsehood lies ;
Waits for the holy hands that took
No circumstance can make it less ;
A tempest , on thy head to break .
Such burning love she bears !
The clouds hang over it , heavy and gray ,
Eternal as the sun whose radiance wakes the day .
Nine long years may he be worn by sickness ,
Where our bright windows made day dim ,
This morning the parson takes a drive .
A lofty hope , if earnestly pursued ,
And thus in turn his answer made :
Whose talents to fill any station were fit ,
Since life and death in cycles come and go ,
No hint of conflict entered in
To all the joys that can be found
Then off there flung in smiling joy ,
Nor is there one sure cause revealed to men
And swarthy vervain , tipped with violet fire .
Yet some there were who truly grateful felt ,
Till closer , closer come the two ,
That palely comes and covers all .
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three : --
The stars to look our way and honor us .
We felt the minutes crawl :
And they who stood to welcome
And lay secure , thinking of all it meant --
The sick sound aching in a lifted throat
No happier task these faded eyes pursue ;
When those glories gave her joy ;
Ready to seal the prisoner 's fate .
And towns and temples star his shadowy sides .
But seated ' neath the milk-white thorn ,
Just as god leads , i all resign ;
Kept bravely back he makes a rainbow shine ;
And militza gave this quiet answer :
Her blush was rippling with a smile
Come on ! well slip a little nearer .
No sound of thunder fell upon my ear ;
Of her eyes , electrified by wine
Were i to give thee baptism , i would choose
Like sudden rainbows spread their arching wings ,
Embraces our low earth , he would adduce
But i -- i feel i 'd rather cry ;
Wherein the lamplight , scattered and sick and pale ,
Arriving with the marriage-treaty , found
Have dealt the swift and desperate blow ,
And makes a rival of her worshipper .
Yet shall my white arms hold thee ,
And long in bitterness to reach the goal !
Would echo the groans of despair ,
To follow truth -- wherever it may lead ;
Nor the joys and pains of it told ?
Here hector , plunging through the thickest fight ,
And i made answer as by him controlled .
Before her ran an influence fleet ,
Adown the dim valley glides slowly along ,
Tears harden lust , though marble wear with raining .
And leave thee wild and sad !
With speedy drops spread tracks often
The force of the passions which inwardly dwell .
His fame in arms not owing all to me .
To mix in rural mood among
To breathe my soul in fragrance there ;
Making the silence terrible with voices ,
Heaven kindly gives our blood a moral flow ;
Hence comes the joyfulness with which i flame ,
And now my heart jumps up and throbs ,
And eyes like stars that shine in sunset hour .
In changeless angles fixed and bound ,
Where all things bear a laughing face ,
That spreads its magic o'er the female face ,
If i could bear this prospect , i shall find
When through their high tops swept the sudden breeze !
No longer dear vesey , feel hurt and uneasy
That prosperous commerce shall again bestow .
I ne'er had raised this coward cry
The just fate gives ;
Chilled by the rain , the tender lotus sank :
So young and tenderly her footsteps pass ,
And oh , we feel thy presence here ,
The fox looked back as he slackened past
To set much store by it . "
It wavers to a rose .
For a loving friend hast thou found in me ,
Lashed with terror , leashed with longing ,
And we departing left them to that broil .
He was made to tend an infant ,
There are still gross wrongs to set right ;
The following winter .
Is laid not on our substance , and while yet
And first in hushed repose the hours fled :
That they our heavenly joy should share
But find him still so constant to your words
On the shut door that let them in
This beauty that the mind has taken home --
The father , who of this made observation ,
How from earth came vegetation ,
Thus , weakness to chimera turns the truth .
Her dark foundations , and too fast had bound .
From lofty heights their colors flew ,
That is granted by thy grace ;
The lusty bridegroom made approach ; young man
Yet the wild grapes you crush make life divine .
And inspiration flash 'd from what was thought .
That a father beneath them was laid :
Each parasite , then , as in duty bound ,
Awaiting easter 's benediction falling ,
Yet they made no answering sign ;
Long ere the dawn comes a-creeping
Which by and by black night doth take away ,
Assail it , but those talons hold in dread ,
How dim and strange your features grow
And trembling at its new-found being ,
Home turning as a conqueror turns home ,
Contagion , and disseminating death .
Two furry rugs his lordship bore ,
And is warbling the jorram to you .
Death lay revealed in all its haggardness --
Together sailed they fraught with all things fit
And as they lean with pain upon their spears
And as it went my tortured soul
Is love so sweet , that comes to this ?
She fell in love with an irishman --
With fears that all their ardor chilled ;
O , may thy peaceful arts still flourish round ,
Who through the rings directs the feather 'd reed .
There lie memorial stones , whence time has gnawed
To pour our hearts in prayer .
For to prolong one joy , or even to dwell
Silent yet spake , and breathed immortal love
Received the cruel , plunging knife .
For royalties that pay .
From his lady 's white hand caught ;
Filling the air with song ,
The dawn which pass and never passes .
My beauty , which the loftier it climbs ,
The broadening moon , made ominous with red ,
Bereft of a soul ; the spirit went elsewhere
Bright clouds like golden fleeces shall be spread .
The white will tell you how i languish ,
Here spread the fields of warlike macedon ,
Nature 's pulse has ceased to play , --
The women 's cries rose loud and shrill ,
How a life has been led from the wild
And over the blue where the river rolled ,
That opened in the midst a woody scene ;
Till the shower passes by .
The valour of her offspring boasts ,
Guard thou its folds till peace shall reign , --
And i felt her sorrow , weighing
If but to keep thy credit as a mower .
My spirits waver , like the trembling tower walls
And sirens meet and mock its straining gaze .
When death hath poured oblivion through my veins ,
Horrid to think , how horrible to feel !
And my wild record closes .
Shall , in the vengeance it dispenseth , find
Its doctrine follows after my discourse ,
The end is come of pleasant places ,
But now what further hopes for me remain ,
The oak leaves trembled in the breeze ,
Stars unnumbered drifted through the sky .
Whose glance is fixed on those that flee ;
Who bears the brunt , or pays the bill ?
And see the rising tide a ruling empress ;
To guard the liquid fires that shine ,
Of that new life which man might win ;
But tell of days in goodness spent ,
Armies that famish , that bleed ,
Let the line stand fast in the west ;
One slowly creeps to unassuming grace ,
As now my veins receive the pleasing fire . "
Missing full credence -- overboard with them !
Women whose lifted breasts call unto him .
I scorn myself , that put for such strange toys
Then holy night o’er heaven was spread .
Silence and horror fill the place around ;
The hand that into his heart she thrust
New ramparts raising for the town 's defense .
That lay in the house that jack built .
The spirit of a god my breast inspire ,
Then , restless still , it makes its lair
Weeping another 's death , my grief atones
Tapestry woven of wonder ,
Close as the fondest links could strain ,
Her tears they flow apace ,
This having known , let us a union found
O sun-burned hand that bore the lance ,
So great the faults it stands encumbered with :
And trampled on triumphant rome ,
Of provocation given , or wrong sustained ,
And the press groaned with licensed blasphemies .
And stave off _ britain 's _ sullen fate .
That follows after prayer .
The trust that in their souls was laid ;
In gawayne 's heart such subtle magic wrought
There remained be many summers ,
Ye have spilt the blood of guiltless innocents .
That free love with bondage bound . "
And every sparkle shivering to new blaze ,
And all my doubts at rest forever lay . "
But luck may change , and valor fail ,
To him your summons comes too late
Slowly the shadow on my path descends .
That lay in the house that
Thy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover ;
Through fair and through foul went captain sword ,
The wooden table gives wine as good !
Were we designed for daily toil ,
That something stronger than my love could come ,
All vanished hopes , and all most hopeless bliss ,
And the fierce soul came rushing through the wound .
And while yet filled with breath melodious ,
The occasion which the furious strife had wrought ,
And a brook that goes tinkling clear .
A man went before a strange god , --
There will come a peace within your heart ;
Holding their breath and thrilling his blunt nerves
Her brimming eyes with tears ran o’er ,
The inquest must be changed . "
No love which to the paladin she bears ,
Here goes the clown .
To thee the priesthood of the lyre belong --
No evidence gives he .
Whom thus the sire with kindly words addressed :
In holiness ; but since that tares are found
The toil of men grows near .
And would have flung the fear of death behind :
It found no more the force it lost :
Who thinks of marrying hath already taken
His ardent feelings felt love 's holy calm ,
And pour thy tale of sorrow in my ear .
The gallows shadow rising dim
The wain bound east , the hearse bound west ,
The sunrise shook from fold ,
The sky hangs low with its weight of snow ,
Soon as the arrow left the deadly wound ,
Climbing to fire , receding to hoarse despair .
When they together short discourse had held ,
Dreadful as a battle arrayed ,
Sickly and weak , strayed from the fold ,
't is morning , let the daylight come .
The field appointed for so fell a fight .
And find it leads to an ocean ,
Lest i be found as faithless in the quest
Nor we in her find cause for jealousy ;
And he felt his bane approaching ;
The little deeds that , living , come and pass
His weaker hand the banner held ;
Ere they take thee sleeping ;
Marriage would only add your bills to mine . )
Would make fit sacrifice ! so fortune deemed ;
But inward on my soul let sorrow prey ,
His magic steals in darkness , o alas !
An ocean broke upon thy strand ,
Only the clinking forge the stillness broke .
And all that fills the hearts of friends ,
" pass from thy purer soul to mine ;
That wrought the deed of shame .
And stillness deepened , but the cricket 's song
He broke the bonds of flesh , and lust
Each king or leader whom he found he thus
That admiration grows as knowledge grows ?
Some trace or token that might tell his story ;
To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares ,
The lesson writ in red since first time ran ,
To wreak such punishment ? fame told , indeed ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Thence sprang and bloomed those wondrous trees :
Greatness and happiness is seen .
Something he may recall , some counsel give ,
Now entering his great duel , not of arms ,
Then lightning flared with vivid sheen ,
When thou shalt take our sins away .
The stroke that so had stirred .
And , all mutation over , stretch me down
Is able to prepare thee to see christ . "
Where a slumbering smile lay hid ,
Their gates wide open threw .
To people strange the falling empire went ,
Aside he laid . a different vengeance now ,
Give taste to fruits ; and harmony to groves ;
The pictures left by old jack frost
Governed the fates and fashioned out the war .
New added joys ? dost think thy sire
A lightness came over the tongue ,
Again i seize the theme , then but begun ,
I chanced upon an early walk to spy
Speak man immortal ? all things speak him so .
To share with her the heavenly love .
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears ,
Too few the tears that day and night are shed
Thy church shall praise .
My eyes can scarcely bear its glory ,
Slaughter beside them , struggling in the smoke .
But horror filled her of the holiest depths
For whom all change must bring alloy ?
To feel the passion of eternity ?
And that the heart of italy must beat ,
When winter dusk is set with stars ?
Without showing law for ' t or reason ;
I have and miss the thing i crave .
Is filled with anxious terrors through the woods
That made him lord of other chaps ;
The life that was given for mine ,
He fell to earth with rage inflamed .
And found his voice above it like a shield ,
Lay all our wrongs beneath this peaceful sod ,
And found but shadow laid
Morocco 's lord commands the dreadful train .
The sun has gone down , spreading wide on
And , it cheers my heart to bear it ,
Swift , darkening clouds are gathering in the west ,
It only works and twists a stronger chain ;
To follow nature , and regard his end ;
Which was acquired while weeping in the exile
And follow both the bridegroom ; so the bride
And he spoke the words which follow :
Anuther disaster would laff ’em to scorn ;
Has youth displayed such arrogant pretence .
Bring all your energies to the trial of her .
Now hither comes ; his end the same ,
That it can not touch my heart .
Then the veil lifted from the trembling blue ,
Yonder he hastens to diffuse new life .
Where the wings of the ragged clouds went by
The men make for the house with decent haste --
There is something which always gives pleasure . "
Sweet -- how softly sweet ! -- it came ;
And arts still followed where her eagles flew ;
The tyranny of kings , combined
Thy waters , murmuring as they roll ,
To meet the charge that treason hurls
What strange note hast thou caught from these ?
Of shaking fame and fortune by the hand
And make a vast monopoly of hell ?
Confetti and fair roses fly ,
Beheld th ' approaching war with hateful eyes ,
Now that grey-bearded winter makes autumn resign ;
Of greece was laid ; this witness gives
Or only grief-notes from it wrung :
Eyes made magnetic by some angel wise ;
Long beaten by autumnal rain ;
From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly .
To raise thy monument in lofty place ,
And even wait this night to take possession .
Who marshals us our upward way , unsought ;
There are morning-glories dripping with dew ,
Out of it all there comes a flame ,
To choose a boat to carry him south .
Calm in the halo glory gives the brave .
Called on the clans to rise .
Filled every heart with joy .
Indulgent to his prayer , the goddess took
Ere this was found , the ruling power of all
Achilles , stood , but standing , felt his mind
For war was flaming upon every side .
When empires rise where lonely forests grew ,
Where they pass a dread existence ,
His words , more calmly thus pursued .
Of which the coming life is made ,
Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide .
My hope rests all on thee .
And such a moment made you wise ! "
Familiar things stand not for what they are :
Scarce could the heavy weight her womb sustain ;
The holy grounds of soma tread
Of earthly blessing added on ;
As they take the aisle ?
That do n't restore me confidence a bit .
So , giving me its benediction , singing ,
A charm that is never evaded or broken ,
Converted foes should scorn to join with those .
Where elephants were struck with dread
So found they each his several evil fate ,
And the frost brought bitter sorrows .
The dust has gathered on it --
Which turned a good wife to a better .
No -- long as life this mortal shall inspire ,
The ford , and of it self the water flies
Some blowy pines toss tall and fair ;
There came the shuddering that the twilight sends .
This fatal road has dared to show ,
To thee no light is given , --
That made his sword so wan .
That to itself such perfect concord made .
Then speaks the other , moved by fear :
By showing joy , then hiding it againe .
And yet , such joy does in that craft abide
This truth will make regret the less :
The people should look for their guide ,
Did make exquisite music flow ,
How long it takes you to arrange each bow --
That thou shouldst keep such company .
As when the months are clad in flowery green ,
When , lo ! the coward fear is gone --
Such power was given to right the wrong !
By crafty knaves these rules were framed ,
And draws slow music from those strings .
Everything changed , and life came back to me .
How can i ever cross the sea of longing ?
Fits life to love like rhyme to rhyme ,
That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel ;
What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand !
Thus on each part the sinners stood , but soon
To catch one glimpse of heaven 's blue
He 'll show his allegiance ,
He found me weary , faint and worn ,
Are but old prospects drawing near ,
Came as silent as the dew comes ,
That moment lives forever , and the sight
That pass their tranquil ears . "
And roofs , amidst a blaze of glory burn !
And sees how human is the dismal error
Was forced to make believe that he heard his cry
But hers to whom we glide .
The petals waned paler , and shriveled ,
How the marshes they spurn ,
The thoughts of ruin made 'em dare their best
To rise above the thought of burning wrong
The spirit is bound by the ties
Fleeting years of time have sped -- hurried by -
At length a lofty steeple caught his eye ,
Come boats and ships that sweetly ride ,
The groves and meadows swell with flowers ,
" well may i weep and make my moan ,
The god of battles thus before us lays ,
For love has set my breast aglow . ”
Mix with the tears and kisses of a wife ?
Next follow 'd courage , with his martial stride ,
A flight of martens met their eye .
Alone my sorrow i must bear .
To swell the tide of hours forever gone .
The dark comes close and calls . that 's why
With yells of rage they sank beneath the wave
His face was furrow 'd o'er with years ,
My lute , we twain have idly strayed ,
Each the same conclusion reaches ;
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell .
And gives the gale the silken sail ,
He would give a life or take it ,
A fantasy that came to me
" where may i secure a swordsman ,
So i am with you to take your kiss ,
Decay that comes to slay in open love ,
Carries the tune , bids men rejoice ,
Had followed him in his prosperity ;
' fore the autumn cools it !
As transport took them and surprise ,
And stars that swim beyond our stuttering reach
Comeveden , and amorous him made
I added ( as a trifling jest ) ,
Those whom virginia 's vast dominion sends ,
That destruction may o'ertake him .
But to each other brought life 's aftermath ,
How could i feel myself alone ?
And from his chariot cast him to the ground .
Which makes the southern autumn 's day appear
Meantime , in shades of night aeneas lies :
Outvotes them , takes these silly lies that move
Over the wild strange waves , they shudder and creep
In the light made clear his counsel ,
To her lips from chin arose it ,
Taking a heart that beat with love most true ,
In which they found their kindred with a world
With such great fury met those armies twain ;
And death weighed on her heart like stone .
Canst thou wreck his peace for ever ,
And , counsel from their lips obtained ,
A little over us his station took .
Our feet would fare did each but care
The song he rumbled lowered . round and round
And every thought a scalding sigh did raise .
Soon in smoldering ashes lay
True love , and which thereafter grows by loving ,
Makes the vow he will not keep .
But , ere the nuptial knot was bound ,
Her teeth put tom in such a fright ,
That makes the barren branches loud . "
Where the timid violets hide :
Which came and went beneath me like a sea ,
Centuries passed like a mist away
Renewed his great ideas gone to smoke ;
The bells beat softly on the midnight air
Shouting clans , or squadrons stamping .
And close about me pressed a grieving throng ,
The pale , green moon is riding overhead .
They 've wrought me dole and sorrow ;
A score of stout hands rose between
To urge him to rebellion against god and good
But my trouble would not vex me ,
The threat ' ning terms he could bestow .
And demands that sleep must go ;
To them , when warmed by love , they glow
To yon bright mansions where her saviour led ;
And oft to blows the rival houses came ,
That pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim
With sure brute scars that tell the story
Fly , driven by lucifer , -- himself the last
O when may i cast off this weariness ,
That mankind 's torment waits upon my teares .
As nearer came the time of dread ,
When the world with faith was filled ;
The lustrous clouds trailed proudly by :
I shuddered when the clock began to strike .
Create his might , direct his aim in strife ,
The seeds of empire there he 'll sow .
The green earth takes the plow .
The beauteous wanderer pours her gushing tears ;
Viewing his putt to find the line ,
The morning comes before the sun .
With this i close my verses .
In silvery arches spanning the air ,
To feed his hungry heart and brain .
No angry hands shall rise to brush thy wings .
The long light shakes across the lakes
To his dying mate went he :
He gave heed to no great power
Though all unseen the fictions that they wrought .
The islands feel the enclasping flow ,
For in thy womb rekindling shone the love
For the road that over the moorland lies .
His body lies that was so fair and young .
Innocent of the mud from whence it springs .
" they lead you out to die ;
Such caution in thy breast always prevails
But let us not darken the landscape with gloom ,
Of that sweet indweller he held in store .
" time will fly on equal pinions
The tear of bitterness allowed
Their cruel strokes well nigh fell harmless all .
But hear no murmuring : it flows silently
The westwind brings a swarm , refreshing first ,
Laid a warm hand upon him , as he stood
For if the darkness and corruption leave
Thus while she breathed of heaven , with decent pride
Shall hapless prudence shake its pow ?
Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal 'd .
Was to the thinker 's mind revealed ,
A voice came sweeter , sweeter than all tune ,
Villains would compass it by guilt .
To-day is not wholly lost , beside ,
The cobbler comes the slipper to condemn ;
Until we came where down the pathway went :
’ twas she brought much mishap to pass ;
Can reap the crop so bravely sown !
By her our god began to build ,
Of tamasá whose waves run fast .
This union knit with marriage ties .
Whose crimson roses burst his frost ,
Hoping by siege or fight to break the foe ,
And my spirit to god arise ;
Let thy shafts be sped . "
The cow jumped over the moon ,
So privileged to sink where his has sunk ,
As leads the galaxy from pole to pole ,
A moral lesson this might teach ,
On the main sea to ply the daring oar ;
Of hope yet lingers on her face ,
Were sons indeed . they felt a filial heart
The fleeting hour , may bring ?
Let love restore the fallen to his home ;
Which in the very thought renews the fear .
There they may warble as their poets write .
And then a revelation came ,
Spent in the home his wealth had won --
Will bring the highest bliss at last .
To the terrace slowly wending .
Heard the sharp crackle , caught the gleam
A white fawn pushed its dewy muzzle
Beneath an ample portico they spread
Like myrrh upon the locks of cupid shed .
Or can such friendship fail to move
Of such , when death oppressed the weary soul ,
To keep our hearts from growing old .
Gives added fragrance to the summer flowers ,
Which showed that the reasoning powers were strong ,
Forth from thy breast the memory throw ,
And all alone went she .
She only feels she moves towards bliss ,
The flower that once is blown for ever dies .
The laws that give all beauty being !
Shall draw down blessings on you from the air ,
Your down so warm will pass for pure .
Below this broken life , he ever wove
His nephew benedict , lo ! there i see ;
Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee ,
The billy goat went for the gemini twins ;
And for the heart that thou hast caught ,
For him the slaughter to the fleet they spread ,
It gives one 's feeling quite a wench .
For well he knows disordered speed makes waste .
Scepter and power , thy giving , i assume ,
And flowering forests come with dewy wings ,
With their fiery breath made answer :
And let your eyes scan all the records there ,
Straightway thou must rise from slumber ,
Thy silent wings enfold
Must follow where our duty leads ,
And gives leave freely to carouse .
A promise the youth gave which bore
As yet was weak penetrate half his scheme .
Trees that the wind shook terribly ,
Then beauty following till my heart was filled ,
The chaste lavinia feeds the sacred fire ,
And we can bear all trials that come after ,
The clouds like swans drift down the streaming atmosphere .
Exposed to foes my lands are lying ,
Now sits with those around whose hearts
Or make it whole ,
Who shall give sorrow enough ,
And found it the abode of grief and pain ;
When they together short discourse had held ,
And turned my strength to dulness and decay .
You 'll know what justice comes with suffering then .
Which in their way that moment chanced to fall ,
A thousand years contained thee , from thy head
My hands lie for my breasts to soothe ,
The yellow windows darken , the shades are drawn ,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear ;
She leads the most lovely existence ,
Already one strong hold of hope is lost ,
For their love lost , their only gain
When forth my love to duty went
Full on his shoulder the rude weight descends ;
Have foes and fire found passage for the slain ?
Let me but my freedom find ,
He found her taller than tall corn
The breezes their own languor lent ;
That bore me headlong on my path ,
Her woods resound wi ' music mellow .
Might suffer woe , while these devour his wealth ?
And press the rue for wine .
My soul remembers its lost paradise ,
We regard all signs of sorrow as unsightly
Unto the lark that , pouring music clear ,
By tangled dells and waving meads ,
Its turrets indistinctly touching night ;
Or , all enjoying , what contentment find ?
Of lofty grace that caught your love ,
Life and death have come and gone !
Like trampling feet that beat .
The only throb she gives
To search the issue of the grand debate .
Thou place thy trust ; let not the entrance broad
And old remembered songs came back to greet
Whose soul that fiery flash had scorched away .
Nine days to public mourning would we give ;
Each could have made a river with her tears .
And the imperial votaress passed on
Breaking the silence of the seas
Nor to pursue the atoms one by one ,
In climbings upward inch by inch , lies now
Come to the first things ,
Bring comfort to her tedious days , forbear
And in terror would fly from her presence ;
To that high saint her speech renewed :
That is the soul 's dead darkness , making clutch
In devious tracery that passage lay ;
Shall fortune all your actions well to speed ,
Yet madly raging for his ravished bride .
But he sighed , and in accents that trembled ,
That her brave eyes do not command ?
Trailing your sweet fingers through .
That should our prowess and our praise dilate :
And i spread my wings for a flight as free
The tongues of men may wound thee sore ;
Through all the abysmal depths of space were blown
Of nothingness and wasted days which blights
I fain would look for help from god above ,
Who drew the sad sicilian maid ,
That yearns till dawn find voice and rise ,
And found his void of spirit growing things --
And will reign long as life shall last ;
She flew into a dreadful passion ,
That still , when fancy , lost in bliss ,
The courtesy and cheer that fill your day .
He , whose transcendent wisdom passes all ,
Will send his grace from heaven .
Such need of change i see .
He heard , though pity took not heed ,
And the verse now will briefly show .
His immortality alone can tell ;
Their pashn touched the noble sir john ,
The firm resolve thy soul has made .
Yet for all the gems that strew thee ,
Passion and ignorance , once overcome ,
The face that faith alone shapes into form ;
The cricket has called the second hour ,
To fold the flags of war , and lay
But my mind piercing fear disturbs ;
Than lifelong years unroll of bitter or black ;
Strange voices issued from her husband 's tomb :
What hand and brain went ever paired ?
The debt is paid ; salvation 's free ,
Songs that were made of yore :
Of rugs , while her languorous fingers caress
As if my bed were stuffed with stones ,
Streamed the light of the rapture ,
And yet his words mean more than they ,
Friends , when the summons comes for me
At last the boys had found a cushy job .
I 'll wear you till you drop to pieces ;
Though the cab crawled it sped too fast .
Security hast render 'd me , and drawn
And every night , as night came round ,
All things are working for my good ,
The seasons must have turned
Is made to bear the mortal blast ,
Part of the bottom forth , and went his way
More radiant than the summer 's sunbeams shows ;
That voice is round me like a bursting sea :
For man , from want and pressing hunger freed ,
Rage had not stormed his bosom yet .
With life 's thin song are merged ;
Beside him low in dust old raymond laid :
Where man seems reduced to nothing ;
Gives comfort to his country 's foe . "
When that comes , then work is put away .
Gilding the foliage , glorying the flowers ,
That stands by the water ,
With pearly robes that wave within the wind ,
As on his thunderous legions swept sublime
And for that was a curse on him raised ,
And nature 's hymn swam o'er the earth !
And cast our hopes away ;
Like quicksilver came on the flood :
The land takes colour from him , and the flowers
The blush upon her cheek soon spread ;
Of the twin peaks standing guardian
The morning came , the chaise was brought ,
Love gives us this ,
The punctual tide draws up the bay ,
The mules that drew the litter of the dead .
But right or left as strikes the player goes .
And there to lick th ' effused sacrifice :
And all the gates sustain ’d an equal tide ;
So to the throne the pageant came ,
In terror she cried , letting sink her
With love 's first echoed vow ; --
The purple shadows crept ,
Where swords sow seeds for pale death to reap ,
How , when my girl 's last moments came ,
And since ( for grief unlocks the secret heart )
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
Since we never admitted a clause in our creed ,
The violin drew wefts of sound ,
Which of old time from fesole descended ,
Let 's break this habit of despair
" learn to place in christ your trust ;
That concealed the fear in esther 's heart ;
And tempt from truer wealth that shines within .
All dark the torrent of their fate hath rushed ;
That lost with her i lost might be ,
It showed your understanding , that you know
A brighter world , and nobler strains belong .
The yearning of the tones which bade rejoice
These things produce your waste and suffering .
A goodly bower of thickest trees had made .
And how his madness went away ,
That not dishonoured should thy soul go down
Where gentle thames his winding waters leads
Heorot 's battle . the body sprang far
Thither by evil chance or error led .
But to the pagan herd thy wonders show . "
Their missiles with his arrows stayed ,
A lucid mirror , in which nature sees
Sound is the knot that chastity hath tied ,
But to his pious bile gave vent --
This will make you someone 's friend .
That turns the world to fairyland ! "
To minister and give the master joy ;
With pity my soul on it lingers .
And winter wears the smile of spring .
Yon little brook that sings a pleasant tune .
By veneration most profound , thrown off ;
Is indistinct , and puzzling doubts remain .
To praise that fits thee , clear
Viewing indignant by the suitors made .
That set my northern blood aflame ,
Of old forests echoing round ,
And many a long hot sigh he drew ,
Thy patience then fail 'd not , till prudence found
Shine on him , in moments of anguish .
As a veil drops time dropped away ;
It would give me joy unceasing
Soft sound the strains now flowing fast from mine !
Her light feet tripped to the lilting tune ,
It was not always wrapped in gloom :
There came into many a burgher 's pate
It might have graced a rosy bower ,
From street to street the fiery deluge pours
And i forgive the wrongs that live ,
Still could they not force back this coming cloud --
Thine earth now springs , mine fadeth ;
I meet the gay temptation , as it falls
In me life 's longing win the victory .
While trembling forth she sent the gospel sound ;
He thinks mine came to more than his ;
The red light of morning had scarcely betrayed
The saviour bends from the opening skies --
Than one which daily meets my view ,
But his sagacious eye an inmate owns :
A mighty treasure buried lay ,
A man , whose sober soul can tell
When she had felt her heart 's impassioned swell ,
When the dead man went to war .
Out seaward hung the brooding mist
And phoenix felt a father ’s joys in thee :
The lark that sings merrily over the lea ,
They next obtained a shop which answered well ;
Just as the hunter left his stand ,
Old nod , the shepherd , goes .
To free the hollow heart from paining --
Do not thus give way to sadness .
By love and pity bound : till fortune brought
New wonders to my view are brought :
Burning darkness and bitterness that prey
No hideous sign proclaim 'd her surely dead ;
To join the mass of ages gone ;
Summer has come , winter has gone ,
Alone she sits , nor marks the dying day .
Comes a train of little ladies
And turned him to his rites anew .
Nor fear we poison should therein be thrown ;
Shall be every added new year .
Even while we hailed as fresh from birth
A whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side
A thousand battles have assailed thy banks ,
For from god the terrors come .
March brings breezes loud and shrill ,
That charm , whose virtue warms the world beside ,
Whose savory hand gives turn to common meat .
Answered in the words which follow :
Which bid the saxon king go whistle , --
Then went her sunshine way : --
Has stood above all deaths and all delights .
When the night 's first dream hath flown .
The fair teresa shines his blooming bride ,
Breaks the silence that fills the celestial roof .
My turn to laugh will come some day .
Of mountains , raised each towering crest .
“ it crouched beneath my scarlet cloak ,
In my eyes makes olympian glory dim .
The goblet circles , and the music flows ;
The heart-felt pang discover ;
Its marble walls bedecked with flourished truth ,
Yet strangely pining from the curves it came ,
To himself and the gloom all hollowly prate ,
I see make room for thee to bide
And when the sun was sinking low ,
Thrice , swift achilles sprang to the assault
At kershope foot the tryst was set ,
And the forest gives this answer :
Age is on his temples hung ,
Alarms the pylians and commands the fight .
How many were the changes they had brought !
His colombine that flits and flies .
Mabel 's heart gave a great bound .
Down weighed the god , and in the rolling main
I hear the cries that follow birth and death .
To mark where england 's province stands --
Little time was spent , ere fatal sickness
Who squander time and treasure with a smile ,
Where lost in folly 's idle round ,
These words prissilla 's heart did reach ,
I leapt the breadth of time in loving thee !
Here laura goes , my own delight ,
Here some seek peace and some wage glorious war .
Blind before the end came from his burning tears .
Deep groan ’d the waters with the dying sound ;
Has made the vision of his mind obscure .
The sun draws heavenward the ocean wave ; --
And day must follow night .
In crowded tumults heard and hurled .
Must make a bit of exploration .
There is a garden lying in a lull
" one feeling -- turned to utter anguish ,
Such utter love went throbbing through her name
His radiant armour tearing from the dead :
Without a cloud to fleck its radiant glare ,
And thus the listening throng addressed :
And dawn put on a livery of tints ,
Some wandering arab crept from death to life
Then answer made that presence sweet ,
Me as the tremulous tide tracks the meandering moon ;
Stamping for warmth and shaking off the rain .
Little care i how the gusts may blow ,
Rather than he his wicked will should gain ;
The dew that lay upon the morning grass ;
And so sweet rose the voice of his breath ,
And blessings seen that are not given ,
And on his mind such horror came ;
There came a day at summer 's full
Surpassing , who themselves did make the crown ,
We 'll take a sail around the skies . "
Then moving homeward came on annie pale ,
Close to medina now their stations took ,
Some softer counsel to my ears impart ,
They guide to valley and ridges ' end .
Till resistance giveth over ,
A cicada 's cry deepens the hot silence .
And gory sabres rise and fall
And take the lovers unaware .
Old joy can lend what newer grief must borrow :
Of what right is , than arrives at birth
And waits , in snug concealment laid ,
And time restore him all you take .
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall .
He pass 'd his hours among his books ;
Of every beauty grow in power ascending ,
" when heaven would kindly set us free ,
Death holds them . in our wretched hut remains
He left many mourning comrades ,
We cast the shapes of holiness and sin .
With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night .
To ages following ,
Such was for arthur made by morgue the fay ,
With all sails set .
His fame soon spread around :
Which made gradasso seem of greater force .
And of a holy life that leads above ,
And so the roads they twist and squirm
That praise reserved , that he should slay the son
And rivers leaped from out the snow .
No sooner to my list ' ning ear had come
With stolen hope steal memory ?
So argo , rising from the southern main ,
The burden is too great for me to bear .
The drops of heavenly pity glide ,
Attention must be made to woo ,
Too quickly comes the evil day .
The lesser beasts whereon his feast he makes .
To cling to when the heart takes sanctuary ;
The coast-line melted into tender blue ,
The shadow lying only where we are .
And he spoke the words which follow :
So to sydney once more went poor billy barlow .
Through the din the clarinet flew ,
And led by silence more majestical
More than a slave can shake aside the chain ?
All nature , he holds , is a respiration
Answered in the words that follow :
As the engine moved ahead ,
I bore him , burning with my wrongs ,
With his bloody crest erected ,
't was law which kept the lover 's vows
Then he directed to the friar this voice :
Bring rest to his aching head ?
Lest haply thou shouldst harbour any dread
Even juno sought her sorrows to console ,
But , ere the answer came , all vanished like
And trees , all spreading to the sun ,
Of heart which makes her fancies law ,
The trembling maple 's gold , and frosty-clear
Upon a light gust came a waft of bells ,
Seemed blending with my joy .
And happiness too quickly flies ?
The winds their mournful murmur sent :
Our eyes were drawn together , and the hue
So they made the place comfortable with straw ,
The melancholy poplars sway .
Oh how the tears of christians fell that day !
That makes it hard to be so brave .
I tried to make him talk about his travels .
The glory , that the wood receives ,
“ shall follow you to battle ; when the east
To stand the trial of that hour !
And riper seasons shown it ,
Above immaculate distances that lie
And catch me steeped in all this misery ,
Marked with the only sign on earth that saves .
Glanced at the fact that love was blind ,
Behind the ancient who lavinia took ,
But firm through all to him would cleave :
Nor what shall follow death . man 's imperfection
Be pressed our reeds to fill
All things proceed , and up to him return ,
With their last gladness filled his dying eyes .
And tearful broken whispers , steals the tide .
To set their worth in truest light .
Pressed firm the unfamiliar soil ; and she
Thrice bitter if death 's chains could bind eternally .
They burn with an unquenched and smothered fire
The tears a happy bride may shed ,
To leave you bare of pence or pay , --
Their untaught melody around it make ,
Had traced the story ’s outline o’er .
Time fanned me with his breath ;
The poet comes the last !
Frosty wind made moan ,
There are fair flowers that never came to fruit ;
The care that pitying skill could give .
We find a violent ending against a sturdy tree .
_ springtimes _ made him thataway --
To bright cecilia greater power is given ;
Oh , the whispered confidences that are poured
Great willing heart did lay .
Elapse and others share as dark a doom ,
Whether its spirit laughs or weeps
The dread of death , made lesser dangers light :
Nial stumbled on with sob and sigh ,
On whom returns the blood that we expend ,
There came a day when on her heart
A clear assurance that no doubts eclipse .
O soft and true the notes that flow !
And the young winds fed it with silver dew ,
And glorious tidings come at last .
Pointed at her in derision ,
Her hand may sow the seeds of light --
Issued , and chased the darkness far and wide .
All the sorrow comes out of the shadow ,
His song his soul was winging .
Till lengthened on to faith , and unconfined ,
Feel a heavy sleep approaching .
With his war-club smote the doorways ,
Does earth her happy youth regain ?
Then to unearthly life arise ,
And the red rose would but blow more red ,
Be glad , whatever comes , at least to know
The lore it gathered in its awful age ;
Heard the clear song of orpheus come
The little time which i can freely spare
Where the endless narrow road swept onward ,
From him the glorious kukshi sprang ,
And a mighty wind had swept the leaves ,
I bid them softly follow me .
Took the command , and bravely led them on .
From rainbow-clouds there flow not
With the fires that were shed from her feet ,
And makes a lottery of life .
With us , who through our course will run ,
Till the heart had been broken for sin
The plans of war against the town prepared .
Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame ?
No pledge can hold , no promise bind ?
The sexes sprang from shame and pride ,
My loveless eye unmoved may gaze on thee ,
Dream that in her absorbed my heart must rest ;
Tears shed for proserpine to hades borne ;
So in the water-fields till blue mists rose
And i am beaten . having found defeat ,
The perfect arm that o'er her body lay .
Making my very blood run cold .
What offerings bring , what treasures lay before thee ;
But lips where smiles went out and in ;
Those sullying truths that cross the track
Good the bride that ukko gives thee ,
They kept the faith and fought the fight .
It remained till morning time .
From meadows green , where morning stays ,
A shivering voice that calls in fright ,
And her last sobs came bubbling up in air .
Not once cast back a homeward look : --
And all her passions kindled into flame .
Foul dissipation followed , and forced rout ;
A hush fell over the shore ,
And admitted andy regan -- and a horse !
Unto the ships , and make great slaughter there
Drawn through arid veins of manhood ,
The wind blew from the south ;
That fools butt in where angels fear to tread .
Which painters hold , and such the heritage
The face of winter wore a crueler look
Sunlight to point the path that i must go !
When nought save uses held the street ,
The oaks forgot their pondering ,
Then came a lover 's fancy in his brain :
He thus made answer at the close :
-- no , no , this sorrow shown
The generous prince who made our cause his own ,
Though madly fierce their spears they plied ,
Is the pure soul , that rests not , pent
A soft look came in her hardened face --
Your image , while this life remains ,
And make it thankful in its lonely nook .
Limbs that a veil demanded , as she sank ;
Wisdom , scorned , knows no relenting ;
Then gloomy thoughts rose up in dark array ;
Of that sweet music which no ear can measure ;
Winter passed , and the summer came
His name yields the richest perfume ,
But with your regiment my marching soul belongs .
May here be prisoned by the frost ,
His kiss fell on her mouth .
The skies will not open for us
Nor any squire attendant 's service willed .
Achilles sees his country ’s forces fly ;
Bring their tribes to fell destruction .
As the shoe waits for the snow-fields ,
The ruddy leaf washed by the fresh falling rain ,
Such as the slightest breath of air might scatter ;
My soul , disdainful and disgusted , sought
Darkness has gone away and light is coming .
And so she went to her eternal rest .
A beauty able to undo the race
The summer like a stranger comes ,
What terrors from her frowning front arise !
Seemed only fit to yield subsistence to ;
Known unto thee , shed a tear ;
Now listen to these chords i take from bach !
And white lips moved and moaned . a father tore
To fire they burnt the offerings meet ,
That tear fell not on thee
To blast the blossom in the bud
To give him power as coroner to probe
Through warm provence had marched and menace made
For you of late are carelessly inclined ,
It turns to slavery 's parish beadle ;
Tears fill 'd his mild blue eye .
The lashing storms that muttered , overcome ,
Where the cool airs from fountain falls ,
And health and hope have gone the way of love
From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red ,
The birthright sold , the blessing lost and won ;
Thy steps make music , measured music , near :
New , unknown chords of melody awoke
Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep ;
To turn their backs , or meet their doom .
Around each prince an arm he cast ,
In days gone by , the poets wrote
Our voices feel along the dread to find you ,
Even yet there came no healing ,
Whose faithful love the loved heart holds so close ,
Where was the motor that made it go
It makes the parting tranquil
And with a fresh assault come on againe ;
Of vassalage might well recall the tale .
And thus avoid that hellish dread
Set thy guard over us ,
Ring the gruesome sounds of savage strife --
My soul would gaze
The still of dawn and fell on ears
Who wail or hail the death of god
And made him anxious those two friends should pray .
Him pallas placed amidst her wealthy fane ,
Here found she sun and shade and gentler heaven ,
But , oh ! what liberties she takes
If any muse assists the poet 's lays .
When the twain shall be made one ,
And cleansed of wisdom , let us see
And all its moods which his sweet singing raised ,
A poet 's burning mouth had touched your eyes .
Had raised to count his ages by !
A month or so gone by ;
When drooping pleasure turns to grief
While joys above my mind can move ,
The death that knows no waking unto life !
What woes my wretched race of life attend !
She draws away -- there comes a bitter pain .
But which the wonderous feats well testified ,
That -- the world watched o'er .
Light flowing , from whose amber-seeming waves
Friendship from passion stealing fire .
Who takes the fatal odds in fight ,
On flesh of men the monster feeds :
Learn then what morals critics ought to show ,
Though baser metals pass for golden coins ,
Thus hath that beauty to her face been given !
To whom old fables gave a lasting name ,
His town in flames , his falling monarchy .
Touch 'd the hills , the strife was done ,
The last snow-cloud is lost .
To look for petty loot in obscure hovels .
But counts that gain which others reckon loss .
The wise will let their anger cool ,
But passion ambushed by the aerial shrine
Which with his tears were bred :
And the brightest blessings brings .
To keep the conquest than subdue ;
Three brother deities from saturn came ,
Anticipation forward points the view .
Upon the which is founded the high hope ,
As not to know or feel some grievances .
His master 's hand had led .
Sometimes there comes an hour of calm ;
Outdoors they scamper to their play
In summer she shovelled the snow ;
To give the poor man wealth and joy ;
In all the worlds shall bloom or bear .
And cut the twine that bound the package , found
To shine on thee , and lead thy son
' and when mild evening comes with mantle grey ,
Then frequent rubbing makes them shine like gold ,
A temple of freedom shall rise instead ,
To hold the flood a local scare ;
But now , alas ! the spell is fled .
Listened , and felt thyself grow young :
Ere marcus claudius lay hands on her .
Here sprang the healing herbs which could not save
The spring is come , the flowrs appear ,
Where he for debt was laid .
And when i make this confession ,
And to the quick the cruel weapon broke .
The sigh to rise , the tear to steal .
The evening sees us bath 'd in tears .
The conversation swayed and turned .
Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark .
Valour and courtesy used to be found ,
Thus with the help the monarch gave
And flowering forests come with dewy wings ,
Hearts open like the season 's rose , --
Then age comes on ! to habit we
Could we have got our brood away ,
Perchance , his want of skill they saw ,
The whole proceeded swimmingly ,
Gently it said that i should stay my steps ;
Tell how with gloom he strove ere glory dawned ,
That giveth me the captain of the church
The bruised reed hath pierced the hand ,
Thus prepare a look for surety ,
" and lay their triumphs low .
And let there follow sleep ,
Your little hands were made to take
He takes his fatal arms , and in his shield
Filled me with ghastly terror and affright .
Tam did na mind the storm a whistle .
Can beat his shadder , mighty near !
That my reins good fortune fail not ,
Reaching upward to the sunlight ,
The heart that bore the whole weight of her pain
And here they stretch to the frolic chase ,
The heart of each man moved in him
The clock struck seven -- in social compact joined ,
And lit my altered eye with sneers .
While upward through the east the great sun rolled .
And many mouths must drain the dregs of it .
And wholesale errors swallows in the next .
Onward move where god can save .
A scene of sorrow waits them now ,
Which fondly feeds a hope so vain ,
To keep him mine , and surely now stands fate
Now with what dismay i see
They made us of our pathway confident .
It hath made ready at its hidden core
Rose to proclaim a trace of faintest hope .
The law and prophets , searching what was writ
Thy husband ; whom to follow thou art bound ;
When thoughtless passion 's fetters bound me .
And flames wrap hill and wood ,
But autumn stops to listen , with some pang
Peerless amid the fair she went .
Fingered and lipped and proffered the strange store :
The dream-ship dreams do bring .
And strain for glory when thy die was cast .
What force has formed this masterpiece of awe ?
The linked and flickering constellations climb
Thou ' lt nothing find but disrespect ,
O all the spirits of love that wander by
The atmosphere of anger is at last made sweet ;
Of knowledge , planted by the tree of life ;
And found new shores and sylvan settlements
With feelings mixed of wonder , fear and love .
But makes each heart its home ,
Long , long ago was lost here ,
His order as śatrughna willed .
And vowed to follow whither he would guide .
It is not quenched the torch of poesy ,
To purple ; and a swift wind rose and sang
Who choose to follow where thy pathway leads ,
He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away .
Slaying , and still pursuing , urged them on .
To found thereon , or else a revolution ,
Which mutely told her spirit had been there ?
Youngest green transfused in silver shining through :
The moonlight makes upon the sea ,
Cupid for thee shall spread the swelling sails .
But on your eyes hard films there lay ;
That , shining from the sweet southwest ,
No sorrow we shall find :
The mansion stood which he desired ,
While they the instruments of death prepare ;
Their mingled breaths from out the darkness stole ,
Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight .
His eager mind reached for it and took hold .
There rose a man on the mound alone
The choir of angels caught the word ,
It drove , and through the breastplate richly wrought ,
As the silver rain flashed by .
A corpse to resurrection caught .
Then my dream did waver and break and lift --
Already around me his shadow falls black .
Must pierce the searcher with the curse ,
Thus to take an early potion . "
That struck the trembling eye with fear .
And turn sometimes from busy haunts of men
So still the ruler by the ruled takes rule ,
Of death hung darkening over him there played
Aurora , bright with saffron , brought the day .
Shows nature 's savage riddles kindly solved .
Cast thine eyes upon the sunrise ,
Till we shall hear your voices , mild and winning
And , quelling thy maiden fear ,
A servant added to his absent lord ) ;
To wrap their darkness round the human soul .
And souls recover to our holy faith
All the water flushed with crimson !
The palm and may make country houses gay ,
The stars make the sky sparkle like gold-fish
The fate that my sovereign has met ,
Each gallant rubbed his smitten nose ,
To the sea to work his vengeance .
The ruffians turn their backs and take to flight
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice ,
With fluttering pinions beat the air ,
Set there some dying king to please
And mystic splendors weave .
Of his -- there ran a rumor poisonous .
She 's lost its fellow , so golden yellow ,
And when to stifle and kill a grief ,
Shed light that can not change or fail : -
The counter spirit found in some gay church
Faster than the hunter ’s eye could follow ,
Abundantly his gifts hath also pour 'd ,
That all my sense in ravishment was lost .
It sang to her through the door .
Take from my life the beauty that you found ,
Which providence assigns them . one alone ,
Instant revolt ran riot through my brain ,
Embracing foes they sunk within the flood ,
O'er the blue lake steered his vessel ,
Tenarus , his own dear home that held ;
They spread th ' endearing warmth around :
Nor rush to ruin . justice will prevail . "
They first charged me with disorderly conduct ,
Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown
There was a jockey ran a race ;
Yet with an inward beauty , that shines through
To where our love can reign uneyed .
And , the recital made , all wept aloud
And let my heart join with the song ,
It was the scene which passion must allot
But its music is showered over earth .
And fortune gave to us an heir ,
Whose rosy beam shall point my sun to me .
It never gits good day .
" when indian summer smiles with dusky lip ,
But closed on earth thy blessed ministry !
What spirals of sharp perfume do they fling ,
Nor cruel death hath snatched him from the light ,
The clock struck twelve , the noon had come .
Has died by flames of grief consumed .
Have sought your bold and fearless skill ,
To you from failing hands we throw
In the chapters now unfolded ,
Find the same sense of exquisite delight ,
Which gave a beauty to my loneliness ?
The pine trees toss him their cones with glee ,
England 's blest laws will set him clear ;
Giving thee an air that 's somewhat better fitted
Twelve golden beams around his temples play ,
Sees the last lamp extinguish 'd with cheerfulness , goes
That age must mourn for what is lost
As flowers love the strong , brave sun above ,
Such as the tree itself shoots forth ,
That evereach an hundred knights should bring ,
Thus to a phantom form he gave command :
Ere fear find breath to cry or crave
Full fifty feet a man might mark its breadth .
She fell asleep on christmas-eve :
The lordly lion still maintains his ground ;
It softened torment , in the funeral hues
She rose from her untroubled sleep ,
Shall meet the eye of traitor
One guilty day when god stood man-condemned ,
And feels the charms of every various kind ,
And the sneering glare is gone
My any sense of joy to smother . '
I 'll meet the raging of the skies ,
And give the name avernus to the lake .
When death 's dull sickness comes , in vain
Have followed freedom 's flowing pennon ,
The appointed altars reared , and thither led
Which chalk had given to the dame ;
The lord 's great work sits idle too ?
He 's there alone with green seas rocking him
By woman ’s wile and passion ’s sway ,
Unto the place the guilty soul had lost .
Deep where thy petals drift i , too ,
When fierce war was raging ,
Now towers and trees rise on his sight ,
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
Such truth he to my intellect reveals
Uncertain of the wind , yet seized with storm .
He hath take it fro me ;
Twisted by whispering malice .
And felt her magic lore ;
And all this work men 's hands have made
The affluent foliage of its branches made
A noble dowry meet for her ;
That idleness had borne to pride ,
Her abluent winds shall spare no sin ,
Rejoicing that to him the task was given ,
As his tough oar the rower plies ;
Shall the risk of a dinner be run ? "
I see no fault his fame to dim .
In the last knot that love could tie .
But came with less of fear ,
Hath shed a new and deathless ray
Into the temple swiftly passed .
Nor can they render them other care .
For my disease has reached the very bone .
To where the long strong grasses lay .
Like gambling pledges raked from earth 's rich hoard
Which lies between romagna and the realm
My conquest and the kingdom that i keep !
And thrice like a wounded dove she came
Moves and directs thee ; then no flattery needs .
" all times have shown that man has still pursued
Or make one mourner weep the less ?
It 's more and more i pine for --
She with one finger and a thumb subdued ;
You 're bad enough to manage without her . "
The first drawn blood of freedom 's veins
Since all your life seems meant for fails ,
Were rounded for this paradise .
Some war or some rebellion would break out .
The cactus that trails over trellis and wall ,
That speak of elements unknown on earth .
Has put the giant crew to flight ,
It will enfold him in the air .
Before the world went mad .
May find a summer 's rest ?
Of forces darkly whirled
His place take , to arraie
Two christian bands this while came to the place
The bravest minds , till glad success appear 'd ;
My spirit stood , and caught its glorious hue --
The nightingale that in the branches sang ,
That i may purge away my grave offences .
The world with hands raised , evil to destroy ,
And empty channels ring with loud complaints .
She sees that paynim monarch 's passion blind
With sighs , she thus expressed her anxious love ;
And the glugs saw no escape ;
Like mist to drown all nature , blot the plain
The hours , by stealth advancing , bear away ,
While resignation gently slopes the way ;
Sorrow our comfort , -- lend to those who live
Crisping the ripples that dance at our side ;
Comes winging , comes winging ,
On every side the dusty whirlwinds rise ,
And still the inspired singer held rapt sway .
Yf ye take welle therewithe ,
The fire 's bright flames only painted
Fearing to lose the honour of the fight ,
The crusaders having completely defeated their foes and secured
There where the deep blue into sand doth fade
To make sweet song thereon ,
She gave me love who only asked for death --
So tangled in its custom 'd toils that smile
And storms vindictive intercept the shore .
From holiness , missing the perfect rule ?
Under the shadows the hill-tops throw
My searching rapturous glance i throw ,
Then came the autumn all in yellow clad ,
As merry and bold the chorus he trolled
Wherever now a sorrow stands ,
Live but on what thy poverty bestows . "
And into my heart came he ;
Holding so fast to life . i grew so old
And on the mere the wailing died away .
How did it graduate with a courtly ease
Of rendering up his charge . he further added
And if any painter drew her ,
" always deceitful , " filled with profanation ,
Four years come this christmastide ,
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep :
Would vainly hope with life to make retreat ;
Should make your heart beat high ,
Those titles vanish , and that strength decay , --
The peach-bloom fell in showers of snow ,
( counsel she had a thousand times bestowed )
With this soft wreath the sacred altars bind ,
Silence , and with these words attention won .
And on the land great ruin brought .
The shade of solomos like magnet draws thee ,
Only the water , whispering in the shadows ,
And hope reviving sprang and grew .
It takes my life and gives a little dream .
By fresh airs blown , drifted into sleep ;
Filled with deep surprise ;
The generations pass , the ages grow ,
His beaded eyes stared thwart upon the road ;
For times to come i 'll make this vow ,
And the fresh dew of heaven that there descends ,
One false step our fate may seal ,
May any day drop in to tea ,
Like nandan with its charms displayed ,
From the heart it was hers to hold .
Though heaven alone records the tear ,
The rich earth from her surface threw , but deep
To let him have them . never show surprise !
A slight wind shakes the seed-pods .
In the golden dishes laid it ,
Where evening closes dark and chill ;
My buried flesh should have directed thee .
Its darkness and still fairer shows the sea .
No story i unfold of public woes ,
And left her dying blessing on the twain .
There to conquer , or both lie low !
It comes in full and rounded shape at last .
And the big waves alternate lash the shore .
Breathe back the life you kissed away ,
All suddenly came , charged with tears ,
Soft steal through the rushes , and comfort find .
Familiar to their hearts , who felt that heaven
Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain ,
Grief tried his love , and pain ;
The spear flew back the way it lately came ,
Many a longing heart goes out to you .
Shall , in the vengeance it dispenseth , find
That in my saviour 's presence ever flows ;
And all to yield to britain 's law .
We owe to fog and dust they fumble through ;
Five bands , each following its appointed chief .
Counteth its wasted ingots . life stands still
Ye warriors rise , ye chiefs give room ,
The dandelion shows , and yet , and yet ,
But soon they 'll turn to ghosts ;
Nor potion found he to purge sadness with .
Many a foot is bathed in blood ,
And fates have so cruelly spun .
Like the water ran the silver ,
The entire issue of the short stock sold .
How should it endure that long time all ?
And said , " i feel a little bored ;
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet .
Trial competitive should guide your choice .
Though not by a sound was the silence broken ;
What streams of tears she spent ,
And the heart 's horror stirs the silver hair .
How could i leave the sound of singing winds ,
And laid in dust the proud bastille .
Praise to him who gave us sight ,
Now i have broken beauty 's wall ,
Their setting hour of darkness had not seen ,
Where victory rent the welkin-dome ,
Disciple steps on earth when sole they lead ;
He took in fight , and living victims led ,
But now a shark must share !
Greenly sifted through the trees .
All this toil and traffic tend ,
Death at his portal came to knock ,
When my pilgrimage is made .
Fields waving high with heavy crops are seen ,
To his assistance he had vainly pressed .
Pity from blustering wind or swallowing wave .
And even when it dies , to pass
But solyman ran thither fierce and bold ,
But won her young heart where the angels heard ,
For the may wind strews the blossom ,
Peace , peace ! my wild song will go wandering
Now lifted loud with pain and now brought low .
And show what good men are .
Of crags , where birds took nightly rest .
Born in sin , and nursed in folly .
Assumes th ' organic powers its seed convey 'd .
When she awoke , she found it a joke ,
Flowers expand their light and soul-like wings ,
" the ladies share one common bed that night ,
" midnight comes , and all is well !
My soul which yet that ancient quarrel fills .
The son of raghu onward went :
The faith is gone such miracles which wrought ;
And happiest he , that greatest haste could make .
When it stops giving , comes in death .
A wondrous harp his bosom swung before ,
My feet were wasted , and the gracious air ,
Time out of mind erected on the frontiers
Do n't lose faith in god and man !
By whom true love 's regarded ,
Are these the walls whose echoes then return 'd
Who crowd into one finite pulse of time
On desperat revenge , that shall redound
And grief and sorrow fill the soul ,
O health , why make me inhabit heaviness ? --
Planning to pluck the armada plume by plume ,
He drew the earth up after him .
Our intellect is to such depth absorb 'd ,
The land spreads beaten by the billows wild ,
Another version ran thus :
Softly the blessing of god came down .
Whose was the fault whence grew the parting pain ?
And now what lands between us lie ,
I see the poetry of earth .
Their watch through the darkness shall keep ;
And to dark oblivion join thee ! "
Possessed me so all strength was gone .
To some enchanted castle is conveyed ,
Garden-girt his fortress stood ;
Answer i gave not . of that form
And longings thrill , and memories stir ,
Break down the superstitions of all ages --
And must it come to me
As pale it lay upon the rosy couch :
In sympathy of levelling woe :
There power doth take from him his liberty ,
And those twelve damsels bearing forth the soil .
Where hidden it had lain a mighty space ,
Of hideous death still following as they turn ;
The gay bridegroom resistance made ,
For him gray neptune smooths the pliant wave --
A vessel was granted to bear her away .
Tam did na mind the storm a whistle .
Come in this tumult of life to share ,
But it turns out to better use ,
Charms may wither , but feeling shall last ;
That tempt him on his desert way
Yet britain set the world a-blaze
These quiet lakes , these stretched dreaming fields ,
Wuz a caution , now , you bet !
She has dappled grays to draw it ,
I summon up remembrance of things past ,
Do not pierce me through the navel ,
That is american , that stands for youth ,
And still we pay a deference to his name .
A bauble held the pride of power ,
The sun has set , goodnight .
To view the spoils thy beauty made ,
Two planets rushing from aspect maligne
To make an observation on the shore .
But may shed her beams in gladness ;
But poured a sweet and thrilling melody :
That had moved the congregation so .
Are vanished , beauty thrown aside
A land our fathers bled to save ,
Is lost , not found in dancing blood ;
The spices of araby over it lay ,
That nods beside the fire .
How sweet you were , they warbled on ,
Shall all our nation stand in song ,
Inquiries none they made ; the dreadful day
Before the slow sun climbed the eastern peaks ,
Not the fair tree that _ india _ bears ,
Over the ghastly light it found .
And he spoke the words which follow :
The golden pomp is come .
To show their deadly rage .
And sudden sighs precede approaching woe .
Then well may this long stay provoke their tears ,
And the stars did sweetly shine
The lake 's blue wavelets wore .
With the head bending over and brooding --
And found such fair assistance in my verse
Never flitting , that vision of mercy was sitting .
Such the pleased ear will drink with silent joy .
For only thus the perfect life stands forth
When they made feast of joy ,
With open arms the world embrace ,
And i contend the souls who found god , told
As from her eyes the waters ran ,
And drop the circus when the sane folks leave .
There were some things she could n't get .
" let yourself slide down among us ,
And al this made avant of pride :
And the music the heart gave the tongue .
Seldom departs so wholly i content him . "
And playful wavelets gently float
So i , with youthful passion fired ,
Still the words came stealing round me ,
His face was quickest through its clay to flash
I still may seek to act a proper part ,
Which make all bodies anxious to get out
The man debased , the dog put first .
Hope is truth , -- the future giveth
That leads unto thy sacred street .
Far from you , far as goes the breeze ,
Or leave a gap in the creation void ;
Exempted from the mighty mischief goes :
Cast off this body and complete my soul
So till the dusk that followed evensong
Thee i beheld , upon that highway drawn ,
For spring , their perfect robes assume .
This land that reared me is my dearest love ,
Truth stands alone ; thy coward lie
Which flows through love undarken 'd by remorse .
And ranked plagues their numbers tell ,
And shadows gather on thy brow ,
Still ran the stream to the river ,
We see how reason calms the raging mind ,
I read her yearning and weary sigh ,
Those that find lodgment , while his life within
But my prayer would bound back to myself ; --
God 's hand had taken away the seal
All that is good in the past i see :
And light unfading meets our gaze at last .
And lights , that tell of cheerful homes , appear
But eagerly sprang forth to claim the prize ;
That a false smile should play around the dead
Sobbing as if her heart would break
And marked the attentions lavished unto her ,
The go-cart dashed upon the scene
What makes this hour ?
There comes a word like one of old time said
It made its home in my breast ;
And make thy present with his past life sweet ?
At last the doctor found me growing mad
With kindness i your prayers receive ,
Vanquished a thousand times he still finds zest
Into the trap his folly laid .
Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes ,
The succeeding events which shall glide in its train ,
What strong emotion fills my soul ,
Let thy soul make mine reply ,
Reflected in thy waters lie .
True patience , and to temper joy with fear ,
He to those deserts brought his favorite art .
Was when he took notice .
Thy tail end came to terminate so bluntly
Mould their own lives , and feel their pulses filled
For while i wait for love to come ,
My parent 's ashes drank my early tears ;
Of god and of the world , made manifest .
Angels , i know , had fallen as low
Nor sound nor motion made :
But frantic keeps the forward way .
And hope fell sick as the witch drew nigh .
In the courts of truth tread softly ,
His head touched heaven ,
What feign 'd submission swore : ease would recant
A pretty while these pretty creatures stand ,
Nor can find the way to westminster
The leopard skin about her shoulders flung
Will ever his heart feel faint and cold ,
Which had once from heaven descended ,
And swore , in the darkness of fell despair ,
Her beating heart that not love made so full ,
Ans . love , gifts will send ye .
Quickly set at liberty .
And shook its beauty upon us and died away ?
But their bold fronts to chance of war expose ,
But vivien , gathering somewhat of his mood ,
Which at the final judgment thou shalt see . "
And meet that mighty flood of vehicles
The sunlight makes the dim dunes hills of snow ,
The great waves of cheering came billowing back ,
It takes a hard frost to make it sweet ,
Thy fairy footsteps run .
Is this the thing the lord god made and gave
Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears .
He said that rhyme hath little skill to lie :
The rebels thine in triumph led .
I feel as if the organ here
They stood above the world ,
In flashing arms ; louder the thunders raise
And the brave race that you spring from ,
Casting away their fear . man leapt on man
Marked freedom 's pathway winding through the land --
Now : the change of hours that roll
Had moved a fiend to sorrow ;
" thus the information reached me ,
The frost and ice soon held it fast
As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake ;
The sun , descending to the zones of denser
Till a fair flood before him shone .
“ soft pleasures mingling : sole intent to bathe ,
Jefferson so cheerfully supported . it reads as follows :
And each forgets that his youth has fled ,
Hands whose great pressure hercules once felt .
And clattering and battering and shattering ;
Puts on a look of injured innocence ,
While the eternal ages watch and wait .
Our way we held , more rugged than before ,
Were it not sinful then , striving to mend ,
Something lives in every hue
A cold sweat glued the shirt upon his back .
To check the progress of his growing love ;
The uncommonly deep snow has made him think
And pain of life i found a song above
With head outstretched in fearful , straining haste
Ourselves , to meet her faithfulness ,
Who prey on your distress .
Oh , loveliest there the spring days come ,
And when evening came , he moved it down
That moves its holy eyes , and sometimes speaks ,
Blind poverty would stalk the land ;
Till well toward noon when the storm settled down
He soothed and found munificent ;
Gone is life 's primal freshness all too soon ;
To bring one joy to soothe my pain .
The sunset spreads red stains as bloody proof ;
The east put out a single flag ,
High fame throughout the world has bought :
Which , seeking not the praise of art ,
Such counsel that when time got wing to fly
Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky ,
A monument which worth alone can raise :
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light ,
Things that steam can stamp and fold ;
He drives his chariot , there arose a night
Seeking that peace the sceptre can not call ;
Who gave me freedom with the air and light .
On the coast the waters left it .
Where secret tears have left their trace .
This gives you a safe pint to rest on ,
Which hesitation more betray 'd than mask 'd ;
A guard was set that he might not flee --
Put creation harshly out of tune .
Chiefly his fury prompted him to sate
Great glad mouths open , and fair cheeks made red
This stood while hector and achilles raged .
His heavenly form defaced with dust and gore ,
In living box , by cunning artists traced ,
The mild italian winter was half spent ,
They made to be the cause of holy thoughts ;
Body 'd ideas , and could form a thought .
The driver may just unhitch his team ,
And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts ,
He prayed and fell asleep ;
Have soothed or burned in manhood 's breast ,
We owe to fog and dust they fumble through ;
They drove into the sea . it lay
" my love lay bloody on the strand
Would swallow him , and so his errors hide .
He took delight in tracing in her face
The heart 's echoes render
Shalt find acceptance , for a while suspend
She plucked the boughs to make her shade .
Gazeth through tears that make its splendor dull ;
My hand sought hers as in earnest need ,
Touched with concern for his unhappy guest )
Resolving the tangle , pouring through your song
Of their best armed made a squadron strong ,
Woman assume , for grace to womanhood .
And take the path thy destinies allow .
Long generations may hold them ,
See sorrow 's pageant homeward creep ,
Before her shrine , to whom all things belong ,
On purpose to give us their noses .
Shrill cries arose ; the arrows from the nerve
Whence from those steep 'd within loud shrieks arose .
Which tells of jesus bearing his own cross .
A sort of horror ; as the veil withdrawn
And the buds which danced in merry measure
Whose lip hath drained life 's cup of pleasure ,
By artists builded and by genius planned .
Would be departing from the truth . san gallo ,
On the black rocks twilight comes ghostly down ,
He made a luster in that leafy place ,
Nick saw the ghost was getting in a passion ,
Now follow ; but take heed lest passing hence
Whereon so many stately structures stand :
This way it passed : the scent lies fresh ;
" this my message to marsil take :
Like arms with manhood ’s tried and steeled
Marking a beauty like a wandering breath
Our ears must watch and wait to catch them .
A while the deadly fight was stayed :
I find my punishment . oh , dreadful doom
And at thy side his couch of slumber made .
Just as the setting sun made eventide .
This enderday , as i forthferde
In passion tides would ebb and flow .
I sink beneath my sorrow ’s load .
" still to pursue this western continent . "
A riot of roses entangles the year ;
Thou pretty bird , how do i see
A prayer -- ascending from an orphan face ,
For he pursued a lonely road ,
Passed by , and dropped their tears upon the tomb
My wonder grows , since knowledge came
And throttle-valves do n't take to such ;
Answered in the words which follow :
That moment joins them with celestial aid ,
Flowering vines folded their soft leaves around the trees ,
Nothing went right . the champion 's bat
He is the freeman whom the truth makes free ,
The years that lie between us
It made , and forto telle thus ,
For though my heart went doubting through the night ,
The justice called to him a ladde ,
Then suddenly there came a shock ,
While his free spirit , soaring high ,
The leaves , instructed by his grief to smile ,
Lip of beauty , fare thee well !
My heart is withered and my health is gone ,
The world saw the full measure of that love
Refrain your tears -- enough are shed --
Past deeds now from each tongue alternate fell ;
The world was made of nothing then ;
Then a great fear came upon them .
The liege who holds your heart .
And reached thy stately walls , bordeaux .
We must to our ways take heed .
The next new sounds adjunctive thoughts recite ,
With white lips smiling on their spirit 's bliss .
That he who strews your path with love ,
No coming fruit of guilty deeds ,
Which like a football tumbled on the green .
Came forth this second sister face , that came
All classes found his marmalade
Whether with bloody wreath thy fingers plied
Adown his shoulders his long tresses roll 'd ,
Behind , the thick boughs met and shook .
Hopes next arose that he might yet revisit
With pacience they undergo the same .
They tweaked so hard that it took their breath ,
As she found her fame departing ,
Thy father , nature , here thy father see :
And wisdom still approves their word ;
Which brings the message i shall see with fear ,
Yet , while the austrians held their ground ,
Still revealing dreams of beauty ,
Said elenor 's dead body came to death ;
Hath power , directed thus , to bend elsewhere ;
His hurried grave ; a cross of oak to show
The smoke , and mounts in silver wreaths .
I hold it truth with him who sweetly sings --
" the seasons come and go :
Those eyes not hateful that have seen me fall ?
Of some great heart that could not rest ,
And mental anguish , slowly wore away ;
To warm the heart , to charm the sight ,
Nay , -- madame furnishes the wit .
With breath of balm blown everywhere ,
Yet pass we that ; the war and chase
And the shadow that he cast
Such as would make one happy in the fire :
In soft low accents made reply :
And friendship and alliance made .
Here set thy feeble chant ,
The vessel ran ; she took the happy land
Around , around , flew each sweet sound ,
Comes for answer back to me .
To a slow end i draw these daily words ,
Hearts that meet , all bonds are forcing ,
The prize with eagerness and draw it down .
Soon , too soon , your fears i trace .
America should heed . and then
Of worthy parents , and as christians stood
The silver splendor is conveyed , and she
Unto my heart has come that season ,
Slowly it lifts : the dazzling sunshine streams
And gervase gave the tree another shake .
Ingenuous , pass 'd in her behaviour all
The world goes wandering away from him ; --
The white lake-blossom fell into the lake
Moved to their vast , their sorrowful depths anew .
All gathered to the sunshine that she brought .
To all mankind great love they bore .
See him support tyrannic laws ,
The watch would hardly let him pass at noon ,
Giving my childhood what it hungered for --
They bring the seamen ease ,
God 's cannonade with man 's will vie .
With bodies merged in nothingness and night .
For soon he runs short of the dollars ,
Now stand you on the top of happy hours ,
And sets our hearts a-flame ,
Regard as true renouncer him that makes
With lava kisses melting while they burn ,
At dawn , all glimmering life surrounds his place :
Some follow science , some cleave to art ,
Fretful we felt , and quite forlorn ;
Yet still on that horizon hangs the cloud ,
Ah melancholy , how i feel thy power !
To god their prayer they make ,
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave .
To some the air a passage gave .
Forever for the people 's good should spin .
When the white sun had sunk in the western chasm
A little neglect may breed great mischief .
That faded into pain . was this the merlin --
To help the mighty wheel go round ;
As she sprang away from danger .
God and good angels guide thee ; and so bless
But they 'll disperse when you a convert see .
To break the stillness -- to sit here alone
Those grassy spots display the hue
A foreign power he in our temples stands ,
One time she touched the cloud that kissed
I thought in vice t ' acquire a fame ;
That death does not whisper adieu ,
And wide as thought can span ,
To match the promise in her eyes ,
Shall throw strong light when our season is fleeing ,
Th ' eternal providence , i well discern :
Wealth claimed distinction and found grace ,
My heart is weary , my peace is gone ,
Where nature seems to sit alone ,
And from the stir of flames forever winging
When low in dust the foeman lies .
Never give thy heart to grieving ;
Yonder stands the hillside chapel
To squeeze her hand or steal a kiss --
" now the task is laid upon me ,
While the vintagers lay at their ease ,
A telegram to the coroner giving the name
Man 's work-place , lay in gloom .
Said he , " before this quaint mood fails ,
An instinct within it that reaches and towers ,
Thy clear , strong tones will oft bring sudden bloom
The land of cyclops lay in prospect near :
Where they their blessed hours both save and spend .
Of the three labours rests the crowning one ;
I knew -- my bliss did stand .
And he spoke the words which follow :
But still she gave her sorrow vent :
I count it true which sages teach --
The wound that took a month to drain --
Still sobbing in life 's trembling wires .
In comes a herald -- comes with startling news :
As if her bounties were the signal given ,
Of hunger unassuaged , has interposed ,
They trailed him through the month of june ,
To give my judgment . wenlock christison ,
Proof men to lead , and prudent counsel share ,
Thus was the camp employed ; nor ceased the while
Here what delicate love-lights shine !
Left his wife chasing the lure of women .
And my spirits gushed and bubbled like a fountain
And angry taunt and threat returned .
What loads of tobacco shall fly from kentuck ,
He runs down clues and leads , and learns
Of weary eyelids overweigh 'd
Lest heaven , surcharged with potent multitude ,
April brings the primrose sweet ,
Where i am lowly laid .
Till the waves washed through the rib-bones ,
His busy fancy found the thing it sought ;
No prayer can soften , no appeal can move :
Scarce had i mingled with this dismal band
Giving his benediction and embrace ,
Triumphant hymns , ere came the blows .
The change came o'er my heart , but now
The lukewarm blood came rushing thro ' the wound ,
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
Has caught the secret , and has mastered prayer .
That issued from its brink . on earth no wave
Triumphal honours let bright clouds afford .
Her passionate lover leans and sips
She gives the best light to his sphere ,
Her dark eyes flashing joy and tender tears ,
Beauty goes by , a phantom on the hill ,
Beyond the world to gather gorgeous webs
Raised her preluding cry .
All tenderly fixed on my own ,
Laden with flower and fruit , whereof they gave
-- as round his shrine the gaudy circles bow ,
Such easy sweets get off still in their prime ,
Without a breath to stir its sultry air .
He goes , and fate leads not but runs before
Which have lasted from morning until it was dark .
The worthy names , which lasting praise should gain .
With cautiousness suspended , --
There lay three shepherds tending their sheep .
And purpler stains show where the blossoms crowd ,
Shall not my strength remain when thou art gone
And from the bleeding wound the sword had made ,
That hue which hell had covered up in me .
That pass us a-flying ,
Forth with this joy at heart to bear ,
With lore of love . dead roses . beauty lies
The day came slow , till five o'clock ,
My loving heart i 'd fondly tied .
Of future glory which religion taught ;
From his strong shoulder fell the arm that held
So the restless section pulls out once more in column
Begun in ripen 'd youth and steadily pursued ,
That flashed with eloquent hilarity
Where thought of her forever lingers ,
That brooks in meadows run ;
That falls upon the flowers at night ,
Their memories to refresh , and cheer their hearts ,
In beauty lies with its windrow fleece .
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss .
In full the hard , hard times surveyed ,
Carries that sunshine of sweet memories ,
The sable fumes in curling spires arise ,
Their comrades sweet have buried to the curls .
When in their gorgeous robes the senate stood
That hails the morning gray ,
I followed but my crafty crony 's lore ,
Give thanks for care extended through the night ,
Oft out of good is evil brought , and good
And leaves her sad parents alone in finae .
A maddening rage his monarch seized and tore ,
A cry of grief arose !
See you the ferny ride that steals ,
From the elm tree fluttering down ;
As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam .
" ( if paris that brief flight allow )
And his dreams make marvellous pictures
Where on to the alps the muteness passed .
It is too hard , too hard to meet
To see the end of all my gains ,
Nor lose one vital moment . what it holds ,
Freely to freedom we gave
Wastes where the wind 's wings break ,
The gulf was yet between them thrown ,
That one might almost say her body thought . '
Because our kiss is as the moon to draw
And on liberty they call ;
With rosy luster of the rising light :
Through the thought still spread beyond her :
Whose beauty feeds the eye with sweete delight ,
The folded hands lie white and chill
Retire a little , merely to take breath .
For which the human race keep such a coil !
No sorrow there to make the vision dim ,
And as she came a mighty shout arose ,
This bitter truth he soon was made to feel ,
Me , then , my courage prompted to approach
At his left hand which stood his army by ,
Still mourned and found no rest .
And next she wonder 'd how his eyes could miss
Nor yet their chiefs patroclus ’ body bore
Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess ,
He paid his mental worship first ;
As the great steed went shouldering through the night .
That seem 'd to rise with the rising moon .
Now when the night her middle race had rode ,
With them shall no perils attend thee .
They reached that flood , whose waters flee
Echoes of dreamland shall bear them along .
A soft warm touch that moment feels .
The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued ,
How he rendered the mould of elder days ,
The wind came about to the south of southeast ,
I shall sink into the death-land ,
He spoke by generous impulse moved ,
For who christ 's eyes shall miss , with those
Who challenged what god spent his genius on ,
While every breath of eve that chanced to blow ,
It stands the prize of swiftness in the race .
Then from the black depth piteously there came
And long the level shadows lay ,
To where kuvera holds his royal sway ,
And long to go to thy quiet sleep .
Halting and harsh , and all unaptly wrought ,
Where no faith else could grow .
Beasts that have got a lurid past ,
The boatswain gave the dreadful word ,
With lifted hands and hopes divine
That the wiser weak should hold .
Grateful for gifts the holy christmas gave her ,
Towns lost in olden times ;
Made her dear mother 's fame more sparkling bright .
And all the ensuing week the house appear 'd
That kisseth everything it meets :
And booty of your foes , who soon shall lay
Light flowing , from whose amber-seeming waves
Which claimed as for its own the fragments borne
The stream of grief in which i sink , —
But woe which hurled them ever hence
And finds her monarch half subdued in arles ,
They waved the shadowy world of strife aside ,
Mysterious voices moaned and fled .
The respectable hearse goes slowly by .
Slow as a fungus breaking through the crusts
The usual hirsute seasons which destroy ,
Peace comes , and discord flies away ,
Down the wind the e-boat came
Scaled flanks touching , ore entering ore ...
Then thought of fair almira , and took heart
Her fixed and wandering stars the azure sky ,
And when the sun had reached his southern height ,
Of immortality can make forgiven !
With that fell chant ; the screech of nightly owl
Which in that council sit the state to guide ,
Drawn by his pen , our ruder passions stand
Within thy virgin womb our image on him take !
And onward each rejoicing steered ;
Its shelter kindly lent her ;
For of his feats he had elsewhere made proof .
Feels its sails swell haughtily
For they will gladly spend their lives to defend
The watchers ' cheering almost drowned the gun .
Their accents did resound .
See how it rises if i cry :
These bring a prince his best renown .
And with his waves that water kissed
More hard , unless report from truth depart ;
Who fill the fire for christmas cold
Calls thee its master , to have courted death
Raise , trembling , from the dust .
Ere crete lamented her calamity .
For the deceitful counsel which he gave .
" dread desolation shall it make ; nor place
No glass can reach ; from infinite to thee ,
Is such perplexity confined :
In the oak he maketh pictures
And in that monument that reaches high --
The stranger ship went by .
Where chance turns sanctity to sin !
That carries every let and rub ,
Return , and riot shakes our walls anew ) ,
The lamp on the table made a cone of light
His sorrow goes
And kindred anguish find in grief a voice ,
Restrain 'd the rage the vengeful foe express 'd ,
To drive the cold winter away .
The nobler portion went , a knowing mind ,
Every one gave him so good a report ,
And sportively drew it to the verdant banks ,
So fierce it flashed , one well might swear ,
Some strange objection which they always raise ,
To soften , not to wound , my heart .
And trampling feet that shake the solid ground .
It knows a shorter way ;
In which a clean free spirit moved .
He , to clear my doubt ,
The left resembled them whose country lies
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice ,
Sends his command that instantly it stay ,
A strife by ignorance to madness wrought .
Thy songs support me , and thy morals heal !
Whose skill should help and rear again the same .
While yet thy father feels the woes he bears ,
The coldness which possess 'd
Such heroes bring ye forth
And from the transport he did feel ,
By every lull to cool her infant 's pain :
Still let the poet 's strain be heard ,
Coiled by his own hands round his ruined life .
While our strong walls secure us from the foe ,
And safety sought in flight .
Those lights that made the sun with envy glow ,
As never eye created saw its rising ,
So beautiful , came foul and-twenty elders ,
In flags flying , friends that love us ,
But to their strife rinaldo puts an end ;
The knight can best with vengeance be pursued .
Love given willingly , full and free ,
In impious singles bear the thorny wreaths :
Next morning in the park i took a stroll .
And made the poet . he
He answer made . ' now see that the reply
Bearing clear proof of usage and of years ,
But like a summer wave her bosom flows
The hazel saplings lent their aid ;
He plies his weary journey , seeing still ,
The learning which in colleges is found ,
He gave a groan and op 'd his eyes .
The necromancer keeps , the work of spell . "
And sad onythes , added to the rest ,
Then , bitterer than death , she found
Was sure to intoxicate the brows it bound .
Not sorrow snaps the silver cord , but joy ;
To hide the fraud . at interview both stood
Where pure ethereal joins with foggy air .
Was sobbing to mix with the song .
Have faded away like the grass that we tread .
Taking toll upon either hand ,
And the fire rose up all flaming ,
All that is fair must come to this .
Light lay the earth on billy 's breast ,
Must the good schoolmaster make me
And fills my sense with vague affright ?
Beats on my spirit , as on fairy shores
With what a soothing came the naked moon .
Meantime his love maintains my life
And buries madmen in the heaps they raise .
This gift acquits the dear respect i owe ;
The calm that wisdom steals from woe ;
And shed a deathless light upon his tomb ;
And all the moonlight tangled in the stream :
To follow and tempt and betray .
There came a day when on her heart
O let not me the widow 's tears renew !
The politicians give me notice now
Should get enough from the people 's betrayal
All rights reserved , including that of translation
To change life 's bitter gall to sweet ,
The dark frown marked her angry brow !
Earth smiles up to heaven again ! "
In such a mansion , as scarce thought finds words
On a shore where gray rocks break them ;
Ravenna hath maintain 'd this many a year ,
Hath lost ; for love upon his part
What serious breath the woodland drew ;
My love , my sweetheart swung ;
In me are all existences contained ;
To his knight the horse made answer :
Which showed him in that hour
Other illustrations are taken from circumstances likely to have
But wisest fate says no ;
To save thy secret soul from nightly fears ,
I longed my ardent love to show ,
Are touched at all by tears ,
His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely ,
No sun pervades the dreary gloom !
That brought the fog and mist .
Tell us , as thou canst feel ,
You get a thirst there 's no slaking ,
Which rose to all the blessed gods who dwelt
Each drooping spirit with bold words repair ,
Ah , woe to men if love should yield
Not woven of our words . many that hate
And let them straightway make an onset fierce :
Three tiny steps you took , and then ,
Thine earth now springs , mine fadeth ;
In vain the critics set to watch him
Mine arms have raised you from the cosmic deep ;
What happy moments have we often spent
When the full morning came , she had devised
A gallant vassal so long thee bore ,
The clashing rams come driving forth
And how the silence surged softly backward ,
That pride for great deliverance wrought
The ground pine curled its pretty leaf ,
The universe and set the air ablaze .
And then the clamorous clock struck eight ,
And blown hard sails that straightened the scant rope !
And feeds th ' expectant nations .
Never will i give advice ,
The piercing wounds his missiles dealt ,
In dian 's face they read the gentle lore :
The new year coming to us with swift feet
If gay to every ear it spoke ,
With all excitement in him burned away .
The thinkers stood aside
Into thy soul my soul have i infused ;
While autumn winds are up and moan
Fearlessness ? it is commended very strongly .
" cupid , whither dost thou stray ?
With melancholy looks , to tell our griefs ,
All the woodlands ring with music ,
The consummation of thy days approach 'd
To the sky she shrieks and springs !
For sweat and dust made him a sorry sight .
Which mighty good sailing was counted .
It teaches us that love will give its best ,
Where lay my love .
Love enters free as spicy winds ,
Smiling , and i made reply :
Those lips that no bloodshed could satiate ,
For broken vow can such return be made
Others , i found , remembered ferguson ,
Imperfect , ere its organs gave it birth .
Soft stone is man : he takes the lines
Where faith was proved ? -- while to battle moved
None save they but the souls which them contain .
The hours go silently over our lifted faces ,
Though i , he gave it to , decay ,
In pleasant wise to flesh ; and passion binds
Of lawful actions called by justice forth ,
Metallic slopes that rang like monstrous shields ,
His bleeding entrails shew some great design ,
Love is not won in a breath ,
Was borne the prophet 's prayer ,
Thus spoke the dame , and melted into tears .
The night and gloom i can but take ;
They had caught childhood from her in a kiss ;
Delicious odor breathed . a pleasant air ,
The stars to look our way and honor us .
Freedom and joy on the sea flourish best ;
Low homage being rendered , ran to plough ,
And gave her needful aid ; her fame to fix
That he soon got a fall ,
But tears , kind nature 's tears afford relief .
And here , till morning light is shown ,
The meaning of that sad sight knew full well ,
While the rain held aloof for a while ,
Had often turn 'd the art to some account :
Where the salt weed sways in the stream ;
His worke he shortly to good purpose brought ,
Look up , with idle sorrow strive :
Still doth the file of hebrew dames proceed .
The briton views his mangled crew ,
As thrills the chance-awakened head that lies
The bitter tidings to the sire were brought ,
Those waving woods , that shine with bloom ,
Are for the church 's peace to rest retired ;
But shall the dignity of vice be lost ?
“ terror in mortal breasts inspire . not pale
The shadowy face , uplifted from its toil ,
The waves around the cliff 's low base sprang high
And find it still as true
I met their eyes and found them mild --
And shook their dust on babylon .
And like a spectre of an age departed ,
And the joyous spirit that makes them one
Scooping the dew that lay in the flowers ,
Has stood above all deaths and all delights .
To mix in combat on the bloody mead ,
Can you burn up the rapture of kisses
The notorious difficulty of giving any satisfactory definition of
The morning lit , the birds arose ;
Unto the evening went the white-winged bird --
Down goes the top at once ; the greeks beneath
Such truth as mine to see --
Bringing home their true loves
He found there lacked one of the number .
To find what sense or reason might apply : --
Still harder teachings come to make me wise ,
Then heaven and earth renewed shall be made pure
God binds us to himself and to the hearth ,
How dreadful ! still my trust is fixed on thee
" come conquer me and take thy toll . "
A fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery
But folly has raptures to give .
In haste to see the line they took .
The burning billows surged and rolled ,
His travels had extended to bath races ;
With wistful eyes pursue the setting sun . "
Strong as the tempest when it holds its breath ,
And bitter pain which follows peace ; yet they ,
The changes since , and those which are to come
From its hot seething levels a great glare struck up
Tread in my steps , or follow not .
And to the colours the perfume gave smell . ”
A light it lent and borrowed too .
How much was only hinted , what the youth
But none the less his saying gave me fear ,
Quiet , and set free from all our weeping ;
Their fluid empire should extend ;
And faint , worn , bleeding , hailed at last
My fortune will bring neither strife nor care ;
The translation aims to reproduce as exactly as possible the
Only the fall a cruel music made .
A breath-bubble of fire , will carry ,
That culls her flowers beside the precipice
The truth which all my life has shown .
Autumn leaves that strew the ways
" i heard the ripple washing in the reeds ,
Exults and leaps toward the light ,
Ere yet the stars saw one another plain ,
He climbed through darkness to the twilight air ,
It was autumn mixed up with may .
Her unrestrained temper / that she so late displayed ,
Now , science true will find in you
Dark time works hidden by its luminousness ;
And the mourners raise a funeral hymn :
Shall make one shining , universal church
And pangs of death the failing accents drown :
A lingering thing there that makes her sit bowed
Still an unseen presence bound me ;
Rage fills his eye with anguish , to survey
As fits the holy christmas birth ,
Where the humming wings of the blackbirds pass ,
That they should take a step to manage aught
I there stood thirty-three degrees ,
I will look out to his future ;
Thine own humanity learn to adore .
Without their aid to seal these dying eyes .
Without thine eyes to read their true interpretings !
In spite of what thy fears have told ;
Happy though these hours you spend ,
Come , and there my soul will open
But hoarse and low and rapid rose and fell
The decline of literature followed close upon that of the
And see how his stock went on .
There might still misfortune find thee ,
The ultimate perfection leaning bright
And storms and showers pour on these kingdoms under ;
The name and fortune to unfold
Till i come to give ye freedom ,
Stuffing them well with snowflakes fine ,
Missing , the paper said ,
The grim piles lift against the sunset sky ;
Snakelike over the secret it hides .
The very devastation gleamed .
And it joyously breaks into laughter again !
Men 's souls burned as they sang ,
The burden on my shoulders i have borne
Yet not for all his faith can see
Where golden trees shot flamy light .
She took the clue , felt death was love ,
" i give this song to you . "
You 're much like other folks , i see .
Dissolve that long divorce . by faith we love ,
And takes things as they come --
Beside his bed , and many a thought was stirred
To mark the race and make a true report .
Three peaceful years slipped silently away .
To share her grief till time shall end ,
Scarce cold , in fuller accents falls the voice ;
Which christians run , when thorns amid
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet .
She news which sorely grieve the warrior shows ;
The clouds shall flush with a wilder glare
Yes , like the fragrance that wanders in freshness
My cleek seems merely made to top ,
To frequent sighs unloosed ,
And he looked to his strength for his prey .
Set not your heart upon vain things that pass ;
They blast their heads as souls gone wrong .
And high of heart , and found it strong :
They took great interest in their beds ,
Where darksome clouds arise ;
The room was bright because it knew her smile ;
Hadst into evil strayed ; --
The ship had turned , caught in a windy flaw
In the very words which follow :
It weakens me , my heart hath bled
Where are the birds that thrilled the blood
The mimic yearly gives the same delights ;
Make vague signs to the weird flames ,
The giant to the courtyard went .
Whom he held passing dear ; but fruitlessly
Well knowing what thy sufferings had meant .
That gave thee birth ;
Or sorrow will bring ,
He took the occasion , as they stood intent ,
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;
O heart that vainly follows
That blushing to her laughter gave more grace ,
The shock made all the towers and turrets quake ,
No mortal foot hath bloodlessly essayed :
And upon his pipe made music .
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood ,
When the boughs of the garden hang heavy with rain
Night came , and found him riding on ,
We dared together and lost , by magnus ' blood
As he melts away in the azure blue ,
Where it lieth down to slumber .
Whose free embraces we were bound to seek ,
The jungle leads at last
Foulsome odors rising from it ,
With lips athirst for mine to slake
Roar of winds and waters blending ,
Like rivers twain their course have run ;
Which made him have recourse unto his spoon ;
And whose love is by honor guided .
The world to gaze upon those northern lights
When roland found that it would not break ,
Thus scarcely given , a noise was heard ,
And straight the vision fled . a female next
Which shut to clouds , and shadows nicely shun ,
Of days to which such death belongs .
But when the powers descending swell ’d the fight ,
Too bright it shone to last .
Listening leant those silent angels ,
As though to veil some vision seen
The tear forgot as soon as shed ,
And that subdued , despondent thought which wears
The sight which makes supposed terror true .
If folly grow romantic , i must paint it .
Which till their eyes ache let iron men envy !
And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom ,
Mi heart ’s emotions rise .
With thousand kisses wander 'd o'er his face :
His arch bright eye provoked the smile it found ;
And her flight again directed
And total faith in life to come , --
In blindness cleaving to their errors , caught
Than youth concealed in thine .
And still , by prompt obedience led ,
That lay in the house that
Shall days and months and years and centuries pass ,
As i watch it wave from my lonely crag ,
Wine made thee glad , and thou didst eat
As , once repentant , men feel sorry for .
And when the roaring hillside broke ,
Whom you tormented and drove to death .
To heavenly rest the monarch went .
Joy will fill it ,
Why must she drop her lids before his gaze ,
Between the severed mountains lay on high ,
Who singly bore the world 's sad weight ,
Did the grey sea still remain ,
Hither , to take my last farewell of you .
To his scottish squadron of himself sends news ,
Where'er his selfish rule had sway ;
Time had gone but little distance ,
Awoke and found it true .
Of those old recollections of boyhood that make
They came to correct , and they came to chastise
For who hath eyes that can discern a god
And cupid thus lets borrowed arrows fly .
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
And in words of music said ,
Could i have turned my thoughts away from her .
To cast great darkness on the liar ,
Such dread suspicion had her story wrought .
Sure to be rounded into beauty soon ,
With every grace his soul was filled .
That shadowed the valley that seemed so still ,
Self , his name declare .
A briny tear she shed .
The trenches pass ’d , the assembled kings around
Celestial as thou art , yet stand denied ;
Which in silence extracted its virtue forbidden --
And overtook the ass , but lent no aid ;
Which made divinely sweet our intercourse ;
To meet once more the smile of human kind .
Who draws love 's curtains closely everywhere ,
Heaven 's glorious lamp , wrapped in an ugly veil
But he raised a prayer to ukko .
Calm and serene thy moments glide along ,
Had melted from the frost 's eclipse .
But coward-like with trembling terror die .
Where wastes that bear no harvest yield their bloom ,
He shall lean upon the lord .
And also made their opportunity .
And shook it forth with a royal will .
" new forms be found to supersede
Your simpler life , will find ,
Learn 'd sages tell why all these whims arose ,
Against my soul the battle goes !
How you spend your hours of ease ,
Shines , masked at once and manifest of years ,
And their contentment for example take .
And so , as fate bade sorrow be ,
Then these the queen of rivalry spurred on ,
Their merry wakes and pastimes keep :
That ever death so many had undone .
In those freckles live their savours :
Whose birth had brought her to this .
Still warm benevolence sits smiling there .
May not see our furtive kiss ;
It lived in such divine conceit
She is the soul that comes and goes
By proclamation gave command ,
As loveliness wakes lovelier from the tomb .
And man a more dignified character find :
Thither all their bounties bring .
The joy of him who sees and feels and hears
The old world 's evil outcasts came .
If pain did not guide them there .
The fate of a nation was riding that night ;
Alternately their shifting hands they plied .
And put in flowers , that nature weaves
From my lips would flow
Then followed an investigation ,
And its darkness suddenly dies as it turns and shows
Took the bee to be his wife ,
And made its muscles stiff by too much thought ,
To self and the world i the preference gave .
Which must be lifted , though the reaper groan ;
I know his fire lives within their girth .
He makes who doth address himself to speak .
They saw the snowy mountains roll 'd ,
Drawn thither by the chiming bells ,
And launcelot loosed her from those pains ,
When the clock struck the hour for retiring :
Which makes their matin hymn of praise
When merriment directs the game ,
To spread a rich carpet , by nature entwined ,
Appointed , which declares his dignitie ,
Knew not where to look for succor ,
And bear it rolling to the shore ,
That sure he was some spirit sent by god
The pain of loss comes all too near ,
One headlong plunged , pursued by fire and sword ,
In human hearts was felt and known --
The air with different melodies fill ;
And both the babies fall asleep .
Tells also of bright calms that shall succeed .
My heart a sacrifice i lay .
All the meadows wave with blossoms ,
Do not look at life 's long sorrow ;
If to youth our attention we turn ,
More hatred from leander did not suffer
Silver brooding clouds swim by ;
For there she made me known to you .
Here talk i with the wise in ages gone ,
To thy battles sped --
Dim and remote the joys of saints i see :
When , lo ! her wreath bore leaves .
From my lips would flow
And read again that fairy lay ,
Around me holds the captive fast ,
Chloris is gone , the cruel fair ;
An end had put unto his reasoning
Against oppression dared to raise the tongue .
Upon my praises following , of the eighth
And now the shadows start and glide ;
Shouts from out a thousand barrels whizz ;
Of ages glides away , the sons of men --
Ere that fixed hour of prime came arthur armed
The sun went down on many a brow
What serves one will , when many wills rebel ?
Silence was made , and she began her tale ,
The hard brands shiver on the steel ,
The years come not back that have circled away
Did sympathy get for brave captain sword .
Could find hard death so beauteous ,
Till winter comes with icy thumbs
Thy words , which fall unheeded now ,
Lies on the logs that make its pyre ,
But i have never made a whine ;
The rose drinking her fill is
These leave the sense , their learning to display ,
On waking to find valor reign ,
The boughs gave way , and did not tear
Antiochus are encountered with the pertinent question --
The wind rises . the last birds haste .
To many hearts it speaks of god and rest ,
Such a sight found .
Making the sea one splendor where it passed .
Which secrets , hid for many ages , taught .
From that lax shadow cast throughout the wide
And courage grows where dangers come
Along the paths that the lord had pointed ,
That doth feed , not quench my anguish .
And rode triumphant through the civil broil .
" how it shyly waits the coming
For laughter -- but she felt her spirits low ,
The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain .
Some beam of comfort yet on greece may shine ,
That in the scale eternal justice bears
Round my bed their vigil keep .
And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow .
And fate will use a running noose
Then forth sprang gabriel 's wings , off fell
And take the gentle air amongst the mountains .
And bad him put all cowardize away ;
His face a human righteousness expressed ,
Another rock will yield you passage safe .
The sails flutter out .
At highest tide she lets her anchor go ,
Were sharpened by her lord 's plight stricken blind .
Will turn an eden to a hell ,
As if a sun of wisdom sprang to shed
About it hugged , which quaint richness sheathed
And with majestic hands her side produced :
Only the long waves , as they broke
And moved by sacred zeal he boldly said
Songs i set to music .
Two prayers went , wing to wing , above .
And so for eight winters the matter it stood ,
For casting dice where jesus bleeds
Till he reached the blue-sea 's margin ,
Its broad and silent mirror gave to view
To these with gracious mind ; for his heart yearned
And so thy likeness shall be formed in me ,
While the mother gives him counsel ,
Thine are the sacred hymns which mortals raise ,
When the month comes which is thine ;
My heart lies open to you , as the earth
With heavy tidings came th ' unhappy maid :
How to unlock their fierce embraces knew ;
The terror that came from his stall ,
I reckon that 's truth , pharaoh . '
And , though my faith be broken ,
Where cruel slavery never sought to reign ,
Wavering and flaming yonder o'er the snows
Two ghosts came forth like cloud of storms .
They took her to be some queen .
Thus addressed the ancient louhi :
A gentle zephyr breathed through moonlit skies ;
One hero by another bold was borrowed from !
Till she is nearly moved to tears .
The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
His gospel message flowed as truth set free .
Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted
The moon came through the window to our bed .
Sincere the youthful hero made reply :
If nothing future paid forbearance here :
Time who affliction bore on rapid wing ,
Then the heroes well considered ,
Florence has lost its beatrice dear ;
At that dim land , where hunger claims to be
For which i left my body burned above .
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given ,
Fain , fain , my crime would cover ;
Shine through an awe that scares the meek away ;
To a sky where the light lives yet ,
And hearts and hands rise prouder ,
And worthy elders who the ark once bore .
In my bursting breast now burns my heart ,
Who marshals us our upward way , unsought ;
" and want and wailing turned to glee ;
I spent my youth in foul hypocrisy ,
His self-upbraidings found a vent .
Each man makes his own stature , builds himself :
To such entreaty answer thus was made :
The faint wind springing with the springs that run ,
Take pity on a sodger . "
A way the margins make that are not burning ,
The answer comes when life is gone .
And , father , give us first to comprehend ,
Or joy or grief that smoothered lie untold
The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky
Till other 's tongue reveal them . fervent love
Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies ? '
Millions of years have followed thereafter ,
And the green earth go cold .
His lordship took each ploughman by the fist ,
So wondrous were the scenes it showed .
Gabriel , and michael , and him who made
Had circled since that glorious rite .
Still sacred , though thy name be breathed
Or any strong emotion linked with clay .
She taking huge delight those friers to view ,
Then , if the brightening moon that lit his face
The sunny mounds lie thick ;
The evening comes , the fields are still .
Her armour and her steed to boot i take ,
To sit inactive , neither can the chiefs
Rich coloured plates of beauties that appeal
Bringing with it sleep and rest ;
And gave to venus all my life to come ;
His god is as his fates assign ,
Their bulky carcasses triumphant drags .
Having dropt the dear fellow a courtesy profound ,
And he throws her a stray glance yearningly .
To feel thy parents ' hearts approving ,
The gray wind moaned between .
The hidden moon shed thievish light
Which had each so quickly followed .
Of thine artillery to feel the might ;
Of seraphs by strong joy flashed into sight ;
For whom we feel the deepest sympathy ,
For me , that gave you love a day
He bids a socrates espouse a scold ,
I heard , as still the seed he cast ,
Whose blood leapt madly when the trumpets brayed
Handled too much ; how vision of me went
Lay him down in hope and faith ,
In utmost heaven , but hath its being bound
When sorrow would be seen
Lone wandering , but not lost .
O'er her soul shameful it creeps !
And all birds ' passion-plays that sprinkle dew
And battle-banners shall wave ,
The virtue nearest to our vice allied :
Which he of her sweet boy would take ,
And future ages hear his growing fame .
That laden with great joy are borne ,
I feel the freshness of the streams ,
The cleansing hands that made my soul as snow
So i wait for my ship to come in .
Had satisfaction for his folly made .
And thrill of joy o'er city ran ,
Could to my sunk heart comfort bring ;
But find it worse :
And gave to him a ship of fame ,
Time brings all natural events to pass ,
To quench the stars yet struggling with the glare
Of youth , that travels sea and land
That stirs the tears again :
Two thousand years have passed since thou didst see
Their hunger satisfied , at once arose
Let the odds make each heart bolder !
And pass their own inventions off instead .
Beneath distorted words , holding that true
When the time came to give me away --
Mankind have fashioned , and like fools , adore .
Bearing a burden of consuming grief ;
A sable scene ! the terrors hector led .
Disconsolate , although of age to bear ,
And while about the maddened ares raged ,
No longer now of appetite they felt ,
By the new light to be stirred or glad .
The acmè of idealism reach 'd :
Forth went shingebis , the diver ,
Which that dear , provoking boy
Many a promise holds for our leisure ;
While all our heed to idleness was lent .
Why for no cause make sad thy face ? --
To holy things his soul he gives
Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy :
But one charm remains behind ,
Her cherry cheeks and lips that make me sigh ,
Laughter of women lured the wine to flow .
But he gave his head an ominous shake ,
And bleat at all the winds that pass ;
Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl ,
That in his mother her it made prophetic .
That by the very body whence they caught
That night the tower made a new song
The eternal hatred lodged within my breast .
To the clouds that kneel on his mountain-height
And from their mouths issued red fire and smoke .
And bribed him to give me his place .
Such angry passions rise :
' twill not be shown for dull mechanic prayers ,
This can not but make better proof ;
And the fierce cur pursued her heels ;
And mingling echoes shouted " bless the lord ! "
The kings let cry a general crusade ;
Alone with him should share the heart at strife ,
Before the heath had lost the dew ,
Whose glaring eyes with fury burned ,
To match a common fury with her rage ,
Thrice blessed singer , wrapped in heavenly bliss ,
I make the breezes languish .
Adverse to these shall then in glory come ,
Thy freedom to hold :
To feel that nothing can impair
Love stays awhile his world-encircling flight
The orphan in him found a friend ,
Instead of pleasing makes us gape and doze .
On arches great of that rich metal reared ;
And took to studying natural history .
Yet the description lasts . -- holt white .
Our boat flies light along the leafy shore ,
As one whose humour found its food in change ;
In fury wild it stands alone ,
She gave consent , and ' fore the mercy seat
Every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth .
When all the earth is bound by winter grim !
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move :
Driven by a devil , whom men call overseer --
Then he spoke the words which follow :
Not lost this high belief --
These leave the sense , their learning to display ,
As milk comes , when the babe is dead .
Hold strange vitality , and , planted , grow
The glow of love i feel ,
Danced and rocked itself upon the spray ,
Grieving that he such sacrifice should make ,
The trees have offered their gifts to man .
The parliament confirms his right
Seven days passed ; the gray , old year
That told a saviour 's birth .
That dies with failure written on its face .
Or keep the ringing measure , beat for beat ,
O tossing waves of wild euboean sea !
Pray let us take the air , "
The winds to favor our poor , shattered sails .
A magic ship , whose charmed sails should fly ,
To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark 'd !
Our flight a wilderness shall make .
I feel my folly in my people slain .
And through the woods like summer thunder went ,
The gods perchance a little gift may give ,
Unto the place the guilty soul had lost .
That night there would their chieftain take his rest .
In doubt if his soul was departing or not ,
He gave me a coat of feathers ;
The source from whence a name should flow ;
She fixed her apprehensive eye ;
For thou hast raised me from the common earth .
It saw that infant crowned with blood ; --
So sad a sigh has brought ? "
As red leaves follow where the wind hath flown ,
Achilles with patroclus took his way
Pointed at her in derision ,
May crown him with a crown that fits no king
As slow it mounted o'er the tide . --
Live from the days which hid semiramis .
That scarce the world on holidays can see , --
Truth , only truth protects the land ,
He came and breathed vengeance from his breast
And round the coast circumfluent oceans rise . "
In bright exhalement reach the skies .
There where the waters run ,
May take possession of our hearts at all ,
Nor sound nor motion made :
That i had but been playing with his love ,
As tho ' with earth a war it waged ,
And yet his words made glitter of the night :
Miss all those vices which attend them too !
The new-made brethren fall by mutual wounds :
The brassy blare of trumpets smote the air ,
Till all the valley glittered like a marsh ,
Their struggling factions shook th ' olympian state
Sweeps thro ' my being , bearing up to thee
And wrap the land in weeds of mournful gloom ;
While thus his bosom bears up happy thee ,
The freshness shall wither and fade like the grass ;
Awake , arise , thy light is come ;
The house would gather strength and fame .
Is one crammed honeycomb , swelling with sweetness
The balance of her powers adjust ,
Than a dove 's throat strained out to sing .
The snow-flake that the cliff receives ,
Within them shines for me a heaven of love ,
Take time to be holy ;
The music i can make . let these thy men
Her grief will last -- a year ?
That will give me freedom and change of air ,
A pious magistrate ! sound his praise throughout
And flatting weakness . hope beguiles
And ridges the raw damps were hanging white screens
Of the great shade we follow to the tomb .
Following still for love of me .
Watching how my fate would tend ,
There dwells sweet love , and constant chastity ,
Since the case thus stands ,
Such intercourse as man with woman holds .
Then , while his breast with fury swelled ,
And took my love away , i lay and loved
Stands to some virtue and some vice inclined .
Which made the fond astronomer run mad ;
Soft reflection 's hand can trace ,
Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff .
To envy 's self the monstrous jest appear .
Past doubt her wisdom , taking from mad war
And left behind a smile which cheered
And christmas now was drawing near .
Then turning , spread confusion ' mid the crowd :
Hands that took -- but never gave .
But now is turned to grime .
Hoarce murmur echo 'd to his words applause
Bright without blaze it went and came :
And famine hungry bellies lash ,
Upon that rose a soul which can beguile
E'en though war bring all renown ;
And lit the joust of love and hate .
A mushroom their table , and on it was laid
Than a memory of lust revives and takes
For their love lost , their only gain
That makes a kingdom of his mind ,
The growing virtues of my youthful son ,
Yet drew for king and parliament ,
I wish him all luck who this harmony hears ;
It can not conquer folly ,
Ere the time be come for taking you .
Might tempt an angel 's kiss " ?
He sees we stand for peace and truth
The joy half lost because not sooner found .
Thou madest as the harlot 's wise ,
As each were keeping some most prosperous tryst ,
The brazen portals , made the doorway fall ,
Even when in the womb unborn it lies .
And lose thenceforth from their perverted sight
Lytton with locks that fell ,
Of many a hallowed strain it comes . the bell
That lies in the love of that sensual man .
Which in our daily uses followed after ,
The shadows thus within my bosom gather .
The bishop missed a text in missing that .
The grave hath no confines the spirit to hold ,
Then forth she drew me , and all dripping brought
The earth had heard that marching-line ,
Though these vociferations made
All the traveling winds went with them ,
That old belfry rose against the sunset .
Or the lust of a name can lure ?
To drown his love in war 's wild roar ,
Both morn and eve , as stories tell ,
A noble lesson read to conquered kings --
Or bubbles which on water stood ;
Due worship ; raising , every dawn that came ,
That now lives in the other and makes war .
He shall go forward in his spirit 's strength ,
Had poured through , frozen alps their friendly bands .
-- then steal away , give little warning ,
Come faith 's increase ,
To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long .
Behold the change ! -- when angry britain rose ,
Where the cold breezes come not , blooms alone
Of midas , which his greedy wish ensued ,
He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away .
And so dear love doth live and move
The universe unfolds ; all properties
Take my dreams and take my mind
Blest with all joys or sunk in woe ,
And sought and found repose .
Has woven his name in a glory of light .
Less doubtful , as that worthy shade complied .
By the earth that drank their gore ,
But daśaratha , led astray
( but tears unshed and woes that bleed
Should stamp upon the springing flower ,
Where life is spent in festive game and ball ,
That onward came some space from whence i stood .
Each one the holy vault doth hold --
Its touch awoke the sorceries
While tears fell down apace --
In ocean 's stead his heart to move
And tears would slide from out her eye ,
What makes a hero ? -- an heroic mind ,
And sets the heart to singing .
Thoughts that breathe , and words that burn .
Glory doth follow , courage goes before ;
Shout for their champion , and his claim sustain .
No sooner to my list ' ning ear had come
In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes :
By this to podaleirius tidings came
The purple flowers it bore . .
For which my soul did pine :
The scattering clouds haste from the brightening sky ,
Meantime the current , with a rising gale ,
The ear can catch the rustle , and the trees
On their tracks his eyes were fastened ,
Raised of themselves their genuine charms they boast ,
But , give expression to your love ,
Beneath those sweets conceal 'd lay ,
What priceless gift in peace had they secured !
The ghost of his black adversary rose ,
That shall echo forth the praises
Let 's see what this here message says . '
And it shall bear my spirit to the sun ,
The path the hermit showed , pursued .
To such entreaty answer thus was made :
Lest bogles catch him unawares ;
Unheaven 'd the city lies .
To save the athenian walls from ruin bare .
Stood there to meet his fate -- no doubtful end
The silence , turning full upon the sun :
I hear a voice that says , " rejoice ,
May find reward ; and my completed soul
To clear away the wreckage of the past ,
Surely the whole sky moved its gorgeous gloom
And midst a hostile camp explore the foe . "
To ask the gods thy misery to show ,
By him to whom the energy was given
The principal brought a complaint ' gainst the steward
To give just judgment in the warriors ' strife .
To find the spring of youth at last ,
Thou still hast shown in marriage state .
Sunset 's slowly spreading shade ,
To some he 's given minds to know
Take him love and light .
On to the field , our doom is sealed ,
Since chermany was made to mourn .
With lighter probe or deep , touching the faith ,
As of speakers far or hid .
For his strength allied to goodness .
What more attempts for turnus can be made ,
And under these observatories he made
Miraculous harvests spread and rolled ,
Pride points the path that leads to liberty ;
And my kisses shall teach thy lips
There was that man who came into her life
What i err 'd in , what corrected ,
Ages remote , and nations yet to rise .
And there came the time for sleeping ,
To frame her cloudy prison for the soul !
So in old age things near us slip away ,
" how it comes , with its stately tread ,
To chase the dreadful battle from the fleet
Fill thy spirit with delight
Of roses taught by wine to bloom .
Who made wayfarers that ill use obey .
Short stages and took my ease ;
From lovely flowers that never fade ,
From cloud or blown grass tossing free ,
Shall , with their freedom lost , all virtue lose
And ruffian winds , dislodging from their troops ,
That can make wrath keep order and due bound ,
Have taken courage to assail your land .
The wanton winding dance he traces .
The good man 's soul laughed interested out .
Cast them about me and dreamily drifted
Through all the compass of the notes it ran ,
Great martin shows the holy life , and white ,
Here shot his feet , his arms extended there ,
The violet , gazing on the arch of blue
It flashed with gems and burnished gold ,
Have circled . if the power of sinning more
Rebellion rising , saw in whom , how spred
The water flashed , like sunlight by the prow
Her crystal mirror holds , unite their streams .
Squadrons this way , that way bending ,
My only offspring , sink into the grave ?
Of rising morn pure blossoms frail !
The laugh that followed had not died away
Images shine ... and fade ...
And now they reach the island coast ,
Our native france again shall see . "
Which the glorious bird gave through its burning .
And his passion boil 'd and bubbled ,
And wit in rags is turned to ridicule .
He took and tasted , a new life
In so great peril , fear exiled shame .
The which possessing , all my saints have passed
Lo ! it led to the realm god selected
Who fog her tarnished honor feel ,
Quickly sets his bath in order .
These as a line thir long dimension drew ,
Behind them , terror 's lifted lash :
What value hath the future given thee ?
In you the future as the past is given --
Joy , that transcends all sweetness of delight .
While his eyes drank the cheek of rose
There very weeping suffers not to weep ;
And ghastly eyes and hollow sighs give token
Now came crashing , wildly dashing ,
To thine own city , and the priest shall bear
The jovial rhymes , that still remain ,
The night came on alone , --
To strike more dread into the moorish foe ,
In woes that were not made for him .
And such as fits a generous king to make .
Thy laureate , springtide , may move
I watch it rise and set :
As i rise to another morning apart from you .
Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal ,
The voice of heaven heard rolling through the spheres
Summer not a song would borrow --
Their knotted scourges , and the red flakes fly
Our hearts thump huge as despair .
This bow the mighty rudra bore
I left your cottage -- to direct the sail :
The summer winds the onset blew :
Unbridled , spurless , without bound ,
And set the fields of gloom ablaze with light ,
And through the dark arch a charger sprang ,
On his young arm her gentle hand she laid ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Seeds of virtue there to sow ,
And falstaff found that fairies live on cheese .
To me alone there came a thought of grief :
The song shows truest when it blurs the truth .
In copper-coloured patches flush the sky ,
E'en as they were , and utter silence fell
They had thus arranged the shares allotted ,
Where the winds remember .
Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
That trembled as it stuck ; nor void of fear
Ere once she can discharge one word of woe :
That once did capture me in cloud and stream ?
Line that marked the victor 's goal ;
And the billows gave me shelter , "
't is only the fool that feels .
What city 's walls apollo 's son contain ;
Thy cross our crosses blendeth . g.
That follows after crime .
Were finished , such the bitter end he found ,
With my joy , my peace , were flown ,
As thus he spoke , his stature seemed to grow
He tombs a body whence the life has died ,
For the deep shades that on their brightness lay .
Mine eyes look through his evil to his good ;
Some chamber flushed with wine and fire ,
His sins , his very soul laid bare ,
And a blue clew he discovered ,
They stand , in awful ecstasy uplifted .
Such thunders from the cannon spoke ,
It made the very heart within me dance ,
Across the deep his labouring vessel bore .
The rose hath put on her a finer dress ,
And all the furrows in confusion lay :
Of thunder , rolled around me , and i heard
But the soul 's deeper charm has flown : --
Exclaiming , drew me towards him from the place ,
The furies ' strains resound through air
One hand caressed his cheek , the other drew
Now that age has come upon him ,
That sorrow had made of her own salt tears
And left a trembling silence ; all around
Has gone from me and left my bosom cold .
Of vows which are not more than kept ;
On his arrival joy sincere was felt
All would be swallowed and nothing be quenched .
The dew descends on tree and flower ,
Her faded honours raising .
With motley sentiments their speeches blend : )
That love belongs to sin and death .
But over the roofs there came
For headstrong youth will run his race ,
We get the flame from someone , light another ,
And trust he will our blessings share .
I count it strange and hard to understand
Here is the place where loveliness keeps house ,
Doth not a spark of pity in thee burn ?
That one by one depart :
My little boat that 's riding there
The weary head fell low : --
That gives us back the image of our mind .
But , followed by the bees that ply
The external world is fitted to the mind :
" once the violets of this place spoke thus :
Until her gaoler 's torches filled with light
His final care his potent regions claim ,
To set himself down in comfort there ,
As he poured his doctrine forth , full measure ,
Nor fears death 's water mounting round his knees .
And the clover laid before them .
For oh , when winds and waters keep
From heart to wild heart magic went .
Where dies the border more than half away .
A sudden wound , threatening with speeches brave :
Through morns and evenings swayed with shifting mists .
Men captive till her kiss the dream dispelled !
Nor can i miss the way , so strongly drawn
Thus on a day of days , it chanced ,
Ages can not bind apart .
And evermore will glory gild his name ,
The lotus flowers exhaled a smell
And in a silence that is kin to sleep ,
She said it made her sad to think upon
Is considered fine sport .
Then , armed with cookies or with cake ,
Marching from eden towards the west , shall finde
For without thee no tree shall bear good fruit ;
I dealt destruction , struck me on the breast ,
Over the garden went a sobbing cry .
The lily 's withered chalice falls
With merciful kindness my misery to conquer .
Which knew no other touch but theirs , and gave
Fresh and silken came they ,
That woke forgotten dreams , whose shaken scent
Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze .
A wondrous race they run ,
The ancient woman shedding tears of joy ,
Ruler o'er the dead , they made him ,
To stir the clouds and drop the rain ,
They dance to taste the highway 's ringing bliss .
It , plaintive , wistful , seems to come
To make disruption in the table round
Then addressed the words that follow :
Close behind me comes the tumult ,
A rest that peace begets ;
Without a body , they can pass their life ,
As the twilight shadows gathered ,
But night 's faint veil now wrapped the hill ,
And made the promise it should never break --
Nor stay the fearful violence of fate . "
Whose rites i bear with mighty passion pierced ,
You can see the clouds drift by ,
Life much , bent rather how i may be quit
Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes ,
But when the evening came , you fled
Thy babe now comes to take the endearing place ,
Where the low ripples pleaded , shrank and sighed ,
Their fights of old when his teeth drew blood .
A vow that was spoken ;
Softly on my eye-lids laid .
" some loved you not and words let fall
Where he has left his sin-excited nerves .
To have followed the steps of your guide . "
Though spent in anguish and alone ,
These contraries such unity do hold ,
And now these parents ' hearts were rendered glad
I saw them , as the sail they spread ,
Down thy dying cheeks of snow --
Your artists raised for that small clique or this
That from her cradle nursed and kept the dame .
The youth and beauty here arrayed ,
Forgetful years have passed on our delight
Above its clouds could climb as well ,
Her love is scorned , her faith betrayed , --
Which makes the southern autumn 's day appear
They waste sae mony a braw estate !
He does his job . he draws his pay .
Already green hillocks are swelling ,
" from myriads take thy choice ,
Once more the genii life would spare ;
Not yet , not yet ! the season sings
Pressed the mob in fury .
The greatness of her woman 's soul revealing ,
Alone can save you from eternal stings .
She lands in london , takes a gorgeous suite
A ruler of the people stand ,
This was the hand that knew to swing
Where leads the northern star his lucid train
Thy rosy lips still wear a smile
“ with water we the fire can quench ,
It just means dirty work ,
Brings good and bad together , blossom and leaves
Drawing the crimson currents of life down , down ,
Apollo now withdrew the cheerful day ,
She was all which pure ignorance allows ,
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss .
With shining sails that soared from land to land .
The visions of fancy that live
Lorenzo , fortune makes her court to thee ,
Nor can his eyes restrain their falling tears .
On ' burning deck ' that stood .
Let a river run with wine :
Noiseless hands shall seal thy slumber ,
Of darts made sharp for the foe .
That all the world stands weeping at his tomb .
May he fall asleep in jesus ,
Have found the fame your shores refuse ;
Pressed the iron of the prison , smote the fiery
Nor ( what oft gives success in martial feat
Hatred makes your eyes grow hard ,
Thy vows discharged , high glory won ;
The earth has turned its brown to green
I 've subjected my views to severe atmospheric
The snow fell hissing in the brine ,
Which lead the seasons by ,
Its branches broken by the weight of snow .
And gain a life that withers not .
Because it could not be the flower it wished .
The ravening hate that hated not was hurled
And the wretched council 's bosoms beat ,
Of these a grove of balmy sort shall rise ,
And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes .
That crowned me , covered me a year ago !
And on my head the dews of comfort fell
From rioting and running hare .
And fire from forth of each live chalice came :
Time dried the maiden 's tears
They held in insult . thus their land shall pay
That curved the lip with happier grace ,
And summer days come oftest
The horror that she spreads can claim
Upon the way he came , while shouts arise ,
And gave the answer fondly sought :
Charm with soft tones , with tender touches check ,
And then it told , as their acquaintance grew ,
Days had not only sped but galloped on ,
And give to rapture all thy trembling strings .
Had that word of hope grown dim ?
In whirlwind ; hell scarce holds the wilde uproar .
Saw the gifts , the powers it might inherit ,
What raised antipater the edomite ,
A deep , mysterious change is wrought .
Of scotland 's king who shrouds my sire .
" the world turns softly
Through skin and flesh and bone it smote
The stern commands of fate may shun .
What chief approaching dares attempt his fate :
To what thy fellow-mortals see ;
On the glittering shield of the wave that breaks
Answer in the words which follow :
The indians soon came to grief ,
All nature sang through comfort of the light ,
Whispering , till the shadows pass ,
" that vengeance god allows thee . "
The passage originally stood thus in the manuscript :
For feelings which in tears find no relief
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes ,
I 've given thee manhood 's early prime ,
The moon of memory coldly glares
And quickly make the entrance free ,
So under agamemnon fell the heads
And seville 's orange-orchards rise ,
Giving such softness to his note ,
Comrades , give a cheer to-night ,
As forth from athens went hippolytus ,
The cunning brownies sought the store ,
Which reached upward to the sunlight ?
In giving you a gentle hint .
Still to a change -- it takes them hence
And took the spells the hermit gave ,
Where far apart the thunderer fills his throne ,
To where the old years go .
The spirits of first flowers awoke and flung
Thy weapon take and haste again to war . "
Low , lost winds come like a wing ;
And leaves his business and his wife ,
Whence tyber first unlocks his mighty flood . "
Could not bring the life back to my limbs .
As through the cloud red lightning plays ,
Nor feel the blindness , stain , corruption , more
And all the world lies open to thy march .
We take the lying sister for the same .
That burns back into the heart that feeds it .
To cover -- the three first without a wife ,
The mighty choir unfolds its lithic core ,
Their shouts rolled to the rafters ,
And overthrew the next that followed him ,
What godhead interdicts the watery way .
That at her flowery work doth sing ,
... . well i recall how she explained to me
Bring good and happy days .
And felt the classics were not dead ,
A pain had stabbed my heart .
His own dire vesture took a shape as fair
The long spear reached him . prostrate on the floor
They seal our linked fellowships
Nor choicest blessings ever lack ,
Making his gift of vision void and null .
To fill the squadrons ravaged by the sword ,
From the south-west stained its encroaching track ,
I 'll range the plenteous intellectual field ;
There the curving bays extended .
Alas , time stays , -- we go !
And give the frenzied bee his draught of honey !
( but ever on led the path that lay
Glory has set her everlasting seal .
That nature will prey on itself ; it was made
The fainting goddess fell . there venus lay
See how the lark goes floating
Find their sole speech in that victorious brow .
And gave my spirit to god 's care . "
Took none but shadows in his boat with him .
I find it very hot all day ,
The long day passes with its load of sorrow :
The voice of hell might tremble to translate :
The eaves-drops on the window flicked ,
They rush , alas ! to meet their doom ,
As the air that circles me :
The tickets that the different names display .
And cast on earth christ 's sacrament divine ,
To see the startled frog his route pursue ;
That his breast was born for song .
But whoso takes his cross , and follows christ
As past the fleeting moments glide ,
Streams of their blood the warriors sank ,
Pine-trees show its fires ,
The clearness of the flame i equal make .
A faint as of death came o'er me ,
To brighten still with wine and song
Into whose keeping christ did give the keys
Now came the sound of that upringing wail
I see no reason why gunpowder treason ,
To lift the seven colors up . . .
He glowered there until suspicion came ,
Sentence gave in words that follow :
Her gentle heart will borrow ;
Answered in the words which follow :
Whose beauty sole had lighted up the place .
Played over a group of jars which stood
And ship to ship made signals ,
Naught from thy lips but truth may flow ,
And hath not this brought the proud spirit low !
The children follow the butterflies ,
The hour which sees our prison door
When that triumphal burst of joy was hurl 'd
" its white cross seemed to beckon me :
Of twisted innocence that you would plait
Down from his head to his heart it fell .
Of reading portents had been given to all ,
Give blow for blow ! take life for life !
Shine upon my lowly grave ,
Than she unrivalled grace discloses ,
For out of the west shall the poets come .
Into her melting soul , absorb 'd in heaven .
And lift your eyes to the ether blue ,
I take all oaths the state can make ,
To hand heroic actions down in verse ;
He saw her , and joy lit his face ,
Large are his eyes that sweetly shine
The coldest heart that ever looked on heaven ,
Leaned on the sill ; casting a haughty glance ,
( for the heart is moved within her )
But that which from these accents flows .
Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke .
That give great joy to me
Where life looks down and we rejoice for her
And since it knows no cure ,
As though to the bottom it fast were made .
Make her moans mad with their sweet melody .
The pilgrim world must come .
And winter frowned where spring had laughed before ,
Peace in the thousand fields of waving grain ,
Th ' eternal providence , i well discern :
And left the impress of her teachings there .
Thus to lay down were crime : deserted tombs
The subject of my verse had early felt
To mark thy spirit soar above
To loose his grasp on poland 's throat ;
The artist 's skill did our joint forms portray ?
The sea 's voice ever yields , beside .
Dead love , by treason slain , lies stark ,
And some lye he added to it ,
His long fantastic shadow swayed and swept
Heavy with death unto the ground , yet made
The morning came , but not the holy friar .
To round the fervid striving of the games ?
The clusters , and the vines supported stood
My mellow meadows set with linden-trees
Truer , when his hot eyes roll on her !
My pain i could not feel .
In saffron-rose wrapped the woodland side ,
Ah , whose white eager arms go forth
With another rhyme . deuce take it ,
Each morning gives thee wings to flee from hell ,
There every breast its fondest hopes must bend ,
Black curtains draw : my bride is laid .
Where greater spirits come .
Rage prompted them at length , & found them arms
From which their beauty flows .
We felt the minutes crawl :
As the burden 'd years to memory flee .
The angel light has shown .
And quake before the gods themselves had made .
And hour by hour thine eyes have gathered light ,
Were built , the fountains opened , or the sea
Thyself in song the oracle unroll . "
And the big tear stood trembling in her eye .
Which makes still the cruellest coffee the best ,
Where candles tall flashed white on watchers ' swords .
Where white-capped hosts crept swiftly to the straits
Fierce fever when she shakes and reels .
Then to the holy grove they drew
Let hope sing of joy ,
As creepingly the tide came from the sea ,
With such consort as they keep
That makes them to shake and to shiver so ,
Nor bounds the blood along the purple veins :
From its own fulness it must needs unfold ,
Let universal chaos now return ,
Struck a vein that made him rich .
Of darkness thrown
Going the first , the smaller loss was thine .
The magic car moved on .
Making poetry out of a bit of moonlight
While joys above my mind can move ,
And feelings such as pity can inspire ,
Then it sinks and falls away to the remembrance of
Ere ever a month shall pass away ,
Bright daylight came ,
No half surrender sought he . at his back ,
Who spread their sails to the arctic gales ,
And success his efforts crowned ,
" such sacrifices shalt thou bring ;
The powers of nature in me , lest they run
A faith to hold , a life to live ,
Heaven 's light is poured on high and low ;
When night brings the hour .
Her shadow ran before her along the street ,
Which announces to refined and intelligent customers
To cars which noble coursers drew ,
From elemental powers this voice has come ,
Evade the greeks , and leave the war behind ;
She felt his pleased eyes read her face .
And poise the wings that shall possess the heaven .
With pity soften ’d and with fury swell ’d :
That thy evangels tell ;
On these still lay the enchanted shade ,
There comes this drama .
The changing faces that i loved .
To ease the hardships of the labouring poor ;
He sees how vilely he his heart does place
Though nothing good or virtuous on them wrought :
The nightingale sat musing deep ,
Thy figure fills fifth avenue .
While passing to this instrument of death ,
By neptune , of all ocean 's rule possessed ,
So it stands as ordained to be ,
The song and the sigh went winding by ,
Like soldiers ' music , made me cry .
And they takes that to be repentance ;
To shun the fury and avoid the sway
The sins of previous lives must bear their fruit .
( you see the selfishness begins to show . )
Take warning hence , ye children fair ;
Slow travelling with dim eyes suffused with tears ,
Every sweet that nature gives .
That queened it over the sprinkled round ,
Dark sod pierced by flames of flowers ,
My lifeless frame had sunk below .
While timid hares were darting out ,
There she would build herself a windless haven
The power to feel with others give ;
Ah ! the wintry years have fled ;
It bore down upon us with such grand array
Music , that taught , as death drew near ,
Dream , and they pass in their dreams .
Impartial sees ; for faith is everywhere betrayed .
Ay , faithful to little boy blue they stand ,
The buoyant ivy makes its home .
Suspicion grave i see , but no firm proof .
But hapless psyche fell , for so it chanced ,
Oh , our hearts will mount to heaven
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes ,
Their seats they set with mary 's foes : --
My life a perfect whole thy power can make ,
Sigh for the boston transcript till it come ;
His tidings bore ; and standing at his side
The passion that had driven him to despair .
Which peter 's heirs keep locked so overclose
Passions , like elements , though born to fight ,
For one whose sheltering presence made
Quick to arms rose louhi 's people ,
In answer set ? what agency doth this ? "
For glories lost and peace gone by !
After i got religion and steadied down
For praise is bounded when the theme is not :
Now took , the rogue ! to downright snoring .
On earth alone to pass her hours ,
Discoursing still of beatrice went on ,
The beggar thoughts pass down the lanes of day ,
And take the harmless folly of the time .
It flows for rich and poor the same .
The drifting snow lay piled .
Where the good mill stood ,
And the night 's come down apace ,
And sleep in luxury , for the queen hath seized
What heart can hold ? if yet i live ,
Eden and all the coast in prospect lay .
As loud the din fell on his ear
The robber gave one dreadful squeak ,
How soon and surely will disenchantment come ,
And the bright morning doth arise
That man was made to mourn .
The forests bow and , heavenly gestured ,
More wretched they whom heaven inspires to roam ,
With grief my heart will break . ”
For fortune placed me in unfertile ground ;
Each moment bloomed and fell .
Softly shone the sun upon it ,
The dawns their splendor through its chambers shed ,
To where i stood , and where they beamed
These snow-flakes love the cold ,
Though far from nature 's limits thrown ,
And angry tempests gather ;
And guard the beauty on her native land ,
By gan the ruin of france is wrought .
Through stirling streets to lead his train .
Give greater pleasure and less pain
There pleasure crowned his days ; and all his thoughts
But found the pois ' ning scenes of riot
A petal falls from the dreamland rose .
And answer came : ' among those faces there
Full many i 've known into heaven to pass
Surely has sorrow darkened o'er my days .
And thou find no defence against this hawk ? "
Destiny led forth the hun .
Now lest what fell upon this thing .
Have met to scale the heaven :
Like tidings to king henry came
Slaughtered the innocents . from the trees spun down
Thou art the shade of her that ’s gone ,
By faith made strong to strive and bear .
How high the waters o'er its margin flows .
The blue sky spread high overhead
But she has caught new love-calls since
First came the primrose ,
Of etna boils , forced by compelling flames ,
All the forest echoed wild cries of mourning
Was with its stored thunder labouring up .
Above th ' unutterable glory plays }
That held him to his purpose when alive ?
And , though it in the centre sit ,
In time of war ' twill never lag ;
The temple , in three days the truth will build
The faith they owe ; when earnestly they seek
Woven by song , truth 's youthful beauty glowed ,
And makes it a thing of woe ;
I climb . the staircase clock strikes one .
The confidence of reason give ;
Danced and rocked itself upon the spray ,
A prophet 's self to dance to hell --
With hopeless heart felt the swift hours go by ,
The frost a ghostly tapestry doth make ,
We top the poisonous blooms that choke the state ,
My sight sure some vapor must cover ?
Lost in the happiness of some dead grace
To find some solace for your wild unrest .
But louder rose the voice of woe
That cried him towards his death .
That spoke so sweetly and so well .
For fluent speech , about the child are seen :
Such health do my fountains bestow ;
They send their eager souls with every look .
A batter 'd shape that shakes its frame ,
Black blinded satan snouting way
Of the ladder that reached to heaven ,
No gallant ship with canvas swelling high
A look at that loved face to gain .
The powers of darkness bound . thou at the sight
Murder draws down upon its head
Unto air what charm is given ?
There burns a truer light of god in them ,
At my own home shared they / my hospitality .
Where fade the tracks of all who went before :
Is more than time enough to find a world .
How genesis begins -- should come supplies
But then the arrows began singing at the frontier .
Time steals from love !
Then , gathering strength , he bared his face again
His beauteous princess cast a mournful look ,
The cock sang merrily ;
My comfort stood : and the bright sun was now
Crying " cut 'em into sassage ,
And down over the thames the darkness drew .
No thunderbolt , nor beating rain ,
Each came out a perfect likeness .
From bars of cloud that seemed to stand between ,
That surely lies in breathing english air .
From the hero 's foot that spouted .
While day arises , that sweet hour of prime .
And now my soul , exhausted , dying ,
On cyclone wings will reach this place --
And here i set my face towards home ,
The muse of melancholy sits and moans ;
Of living hearts that crack within the fire
Each bolt that o'er the sinner vainly rolls ,
Then let thy prayers arise
Thee and thy monkey-sprites with fell disaster ?
In triumph issuing forth thir glorious chief ;
With a flutter and clamor that never did stop ,
As if the end drew near .
His steps to guide , his soul to shield ?
Christ saw a wedding once , the scripture says ,
Is glorious with the light you bring .
For i go for women 's rights ;
Only it chanced that bound beside the king
Some trace or token that might tell his story ;
It holds the blood of sun and star ,
Could not see your heart of passion ,
Was oft in prayer or wrapped in contemplation .
And breastplate 's edge , nor stayed its onset ere
And how the goddesses came down to men :
We praise , an ' sling the cheers about ;
His easy footsteps seem to come --
Upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel . '
We tread the way through one eternal gate .
I set my charm upon your kindly arm ,
But stupor and a drowsy sweetness came
All fresh he lies , with every living grace ,
And hisses with the wind that is escaping ;
Who was suddenly seized with the plague ;
May peace come never to his nest
For forty years thou ' st kept the time ,
Of pensive music echoing all around ,
" see how time makes all grief decay , "
The major and i went a sporting together ,
The treasures of his words unlocks
One shot should ye see . ’
Upon a morn of autumn , crosses flying
May his soul find rest in heaven --
And there october passes
But the second cried , " beware ,
By artists builded and by genius planned ,
Time 's finger should have stretched to show
The heavenly law reversed ; while in the arctic sea
I never have heard what dalliance means ,
To those gay sounds that still came o'er ,
Till thou , beethoven , breathed the spring :
The faith by saint patrick was planted and grew ,
But the sweet one that stayed ,
And pay my homage to the knight
Here , surly charons make their annual trip ,
We rise from out the soul of her
And not complain when plans go wrong ;
Or discern as his eyelids lost light ,
And he turned his eyes to north-west ,
Nor own her share of pain .
With those first loves that never come again .
Fresh vigor with the hope returned ,
With his will -- there bind him fast ,
And feel an awe within thee rise ,
And grow immortal by the stand we make .
Dispel the gloom that broods upon my mind ;
Faith i shall give the answer reynard gave :
From the vanishing gallop rose clear :
Sad shell that served no end of earth .
The flames round the red coals softly spin ,
To heaven her furious countenance she lifts :
And clouds along its blue abysses rolled ,
Shall ever wash away , what men
They run down out of heaven .
While heedlessly the rattling car fled on .
To move three tongues as a fierce serpent shows ,
We give to time eternity 's regard ;
A twilight torn with screams .
't is all that heaven allows .
By a change of accent made ,
To guide the stroke . but tyranny is feared
While song and incense filled the air !
On billows which the breezes raised
Into the lit circle which called and drew
On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid .
Which wakes the universe , and stills ,
Where spurting and suppressed it lay ,
Where battered was the wall he sallied out ,
Ages remote , and nations yet to rise .
The ship recoiling trembles on the tide ,
Ere birth 's releasing hell was reached ?
And gives whole nations to the waste of wars ,
Nightly renew 'd the kisses of the moon .
Had there their ambush laid .
They died , their brave hearts breaking slow ,
His eyes from the dark doorway flashed farewell
Would fit him well and make him smart :
At what that dying eve had brought to pass ,
The timid wild flowers met the sight ,
You will reach a fiery river ,
But find no answer -- only suppositions .
I 'll give you a right earnest knock ,
" ah , " my friend made reply ,
Now cuts the iron king with vacant stare .
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore ,
Fancy makes me more than king ;
And keep a while the rosy bliss .
And merit praise from ages yet to come .
And a life that was worth the leading .
Belief that grew of all beliefs
Which gives them the advantage in the trade .
Sad as the last which reddens over one
Could , even from angels , bring such song !
Is battle nature 's mandate , here it reigned ,
Till every pulse beat true to airs divine ,
And take the best the fleeting hour can give .
The wealth he left for this detested shore :
Friends rushed to intervene , the fight was stopped .
And heal with freedom what your slavery cursed .
One sorrowful secret it could not conceal ,
Like to a falcon issuing from the hood ,
The image faded . there he lay again
She in a strife draws sweeter from her eyes .
And all round the candle the crooked shadows come ,
Tidings are brought which irk the damsel sore ,
Grief and joy come for a day ;
And the fog lay on the river ,
But natural necessity begot .
And every love is cruel when it calls ;
Each one displays the meekness of the dove ,
But further says , the virgin-wedded wife
And leaving all i counted dear ,
Where the wood-grape 's clusters shine ,
Whose bells make music as they go ,
' take pity on my youthful years , '
As we gives a compassionating cheer ;
Who set yourselves up as patterns and preachers ,
But up arose the martial chuck ,
The winds strew 'd them over her grave .
And as the war 's red rim i trace ,
In all the blooms that blow so fast ,
Nor love , nor praise can make him whole ;
Why did you shatter my delusion , roy ,
Her love would live on until death --
Then turned to his sizzling ,
The hands we lay
Death thy bright smiles rends and scatters ,
" and now there came both mist and snow ,
All of fit age must follow their liege ,
When caesar , following those who bore the head ,
Next tripping came a courtly fair ,
Owns vertues altar , feeds the flame ,
But leave the few that dare resist thy laws ,
When proof was sought , made no reply .
With proud career and flowing mane ,
Applauded , and the spiteful whisper died :
And still its ice the freezing silence kept :
I feel the conqueror in my blood and race ;
Are not by embers cast ,
Our wiser lesson shall be told ,
Dearer friends caress thee ,
But overhead the smoke-wrack hugged the roofs
When evasion 's fairest shown ,
Can centre both the worlds of heaven and hell .
Though cloud on cloud loom ominous ,
The more his pride will bid his love repair }
And found deep plunged in gloomy thought ,
Those rhythmic notes came softer where
Scarce make the drowsy lashes of his lids
The cheek that flushed to greet some tiny treasure ;
That comes as comes the evening psalm ,
But here or there as strikes the player goes ;
Of hope that counted the hours ,
As shadows wait upon the sun .
That heaven would keep our spreading eagle calm
From the vast depths this new creation came :
The reddening scars remain , and make
The wild wind follows and plays the lover .
But no swift wings flash through the tree .
Yet with her terror still her love did grow ,
Far fall the day when england 's realm shall see
Oft to the mountain side by memory led ,
Wherein the ages are reflected .
The albatross did follow ,
Those happier shores , where carolina proves
Pecking the deathless liver , plied his quest ,
A rosy glow suffused the brightening sky ;
Stilled the glad sounds that round him rose ,
Ask not how long our love will last ;
And travel only gives us sound repose .
Then , by avenging fury spurred ,
No storm shall cross , nor glittering lights deface
But some they lift to glory and to god .
Which monster made it first and next a prey .
Heaven they hail as father , earth as mother ,
Over the hill where the white road sweeps ,
Upon her wings presents the god unshorn .
And a cellar in which the daylight falls ,
The waters found their places ; and the sun ,
The strength that cometh from above ;
That can give voice to my ignoble state .
Erect it leaped to the sky again .
Pause not till thy strength shall forsake thee ,
Plough thou the rock until it bear ;
Ye , who have kept your chastity when young ,
Or you shall pay the penalty of this ;
Gives them by turns their grief and jollity .
With soothing power , thy radiance stole !
An ' it will scatter germs an ' hair ,
That misery ’s tears may cease to flow ;
Vice gets on by natural bent . "
( and men whose work compelled them there ,
And breathless guardians fail to stay his headlong speed .
A mortal woman mixing with a god .
To the ancient lands where it left the shells
What thus was deeply shown
The wild birds sang , the echoes rang ,
The leaves cling and grow paler ,
The king to aged nestor took his way :
She came half breathless where her mother sat :
Dark whisperings . fame herself sits high aloft ,
Deep sorrow sits brooding all round our sweet home ;
A wilmington goes slower than the sun :
Of sacrifice and sorrow , to unsay
We reckon all our days and hours
In youth from rock to rock i went ,
To truth direct while science goes
And the mountains made me answer ,
This hypocritical emperor would have made a worthy associate of
So saying , to his assembly back he drew :
A month went by . we were hoisting sail !
That she is nearly maddened by disdain .
And reverently they bore her into hall .
Leave studied wit and guarded phrase
In manhood must he find his competence ;
The hermit crossed his brow .
Yet not till the sun was riding high
Why loveridge chase had taken up the work
Sing as they pierce the blot of shame ,
Grappled their decks and drew them to the land ,
As moonbeams shot through cloudy veil .
Threading slant rains that flash and sing ,
' gainst nature thus put in his plea .
Making a blessing of the ban ;
Thy pipe would follow with full merry chear .
Full knee-deep lies the winter snow ,
" at early morn swept daisy dare , --
That brings us either ale or beer ;
Destruction on what realms this dawn shall bring !
Never a lantern streaks the dark ,
Of light : for thus we mount into the sum
They set at odds heaven 's jarring attributes ;
That man was made to mourn .
No voice succeeding , he perceived the foe .
As if to say her life should starve and lie
God sent me sorrows , -- with a sigh
Fills my life and soothes my heart ;
While the eternal ages watch and wait .
The frozen pests found shelter ; in whose jaws
Heart arose to regain it .
And sell their reputations passing cheap .
That spoke so sweetly and so well .
To catch the wheel of fortune with each turn .
And saw the crowd toil on in busy strife ,
Are such delights to make the world more sweet !
No sprightly songs , to banish grief ,
In which they move , and run their race ;
Of those , who load them with committed sin .
Whan he is put to his penance ,
The pain to be deprived or to forget .
Truth , that clearly doth declare
Quiet , nor showing their accustomed pride ,
In cleon 's face we fling our battle gage ,
And even when it dies , to pass
As fall the leaves , so drop the days
They surged about me singing of the south --
Aeneas saw it come , and , stooping low
All made akin once more beneath those eyes
Ye mists and exhalations , that now rise
And blossom 'd orchards stretch their silver shade ;
Seas that have struck brave ships ashore , while through
But she the goddess whose white star is set ,
You 'll rarely find him make a foolish bet .
It 's coming to know that she never knew why
My gladsome soul did to such views respond ,
One wild , heart-broken shriek she gave ;
While day arises , that sweet hour of prime .
My soul already has grown quite weary
Every bank a gate had granted .
The vows and promises you 've made .
Idly the music from thy mother caught ;
Have circled . if the power of sinning more
Bright fancies drew upon the walls .
His solemn oath attested to forswear .
Till swayed by smiles from thee !
Lifeless beneath its edges many a good champion lay .
That the north may see the sunshine ,
A sea of sorrows from whence are drawn such showers
He hastened away to make confession ;
To add more victims to th ' already slain .
The soul of arthur comes to earth once more .
The portal of her stately mansion stood ,
My days have crackled and gone up in smoke ,
Thick beats his heart , the troubled motions rise .
For sin and stain were banished thence
May bring thee wealth untold .
With choice we fix , with sympathy we burn ;
Not a thought to break our leisure ,
The muses , that of learning make their choice ;
But should i meet with an unlucky run ,
The water which beside it stood ;
Roses blushing as they blow ,
Wherefrom the snows of duty flushed to rose ,
Instructs the boy to bear her spouse the gift .
Thy laughter soaked in tears which no one sees .
Like lightning , fierce aeneas , rolling on ,
Beholds troy 's navy scattered far and nigh ,
The hermit ’s heart perceived the wile .
Search out and shape the will of god
Nor fame , nor censure they regarded ;
' my presence asked ' to see her marry
She lends the warning voice to fate ;
My heart made , finding failure in its scope .
Blinded by clouds the sky sinks .
Remember that our sin made god himself ,
Nor sunk in pity near allied to love ,
There fell between his brothers a debate ,
Do not give this suitor welcome ,
The phoenix builds her spicy nest ;
So lately circled by the whirling snows ,
And waved and wound it softly round the world ,
Of one about to reach her journey 's end .
The southwest wind blew fresh and fair ,
A northward path began to roam ,
And from thy heart pour out the passionate prayer
That instant turned to hide her tears , and saw
The terror of my presence felt .
I can not fill my cranium with wine ,
While still the autumn sweetly shone ,
On ida 's summit to digest his wrath . "
The summer passed , the autumn came ; the stalks
Beside old altars where our offerings lay , --
To bear with , nay encourage , truth .
For one who had passed from cross to crown ,
She , early led to happier talks at home ,
The road goes crawling up a long hillside ,
Just formed by nature for some tired queen ,
Which of you praises ? since god made your acts
His embrace -- what maddening rapture bound us !
On some rock the wild wave wraps ,
Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies .
The seasons went and came again ;
Spirit to spirit as lovers use .
In token of the fellowship we keep .
I follow a famous father ,
And from its death the other drew fresh life ,
Where only merit constant pay receives ,
And from the darkness came a voice --
And he makes her act the part
Decisive should pronounce the best award .
Time wove the pattern of the years , that so
Wretch ! to destroy a prince that friendship gives ,
The cup of my heart filled i with love ;
And to this conclusion came :
Thy station calmly didst thou keep ,
And reign 'd , commanding in his monarchy .
Is born of happiness to come .
Men died and homesteads leapt in flame :
Of that bright world there stands this promise cheering :
And issuing from his wound so wide a stream :
That came to comfort her .
These lines follow in the ms. :
Unless some bait thou bear . ”
And rains o'er many regions fall , so too
An if i have to break five hundred heads !
Of tenderness ; rising every morn
And you , by instinct , flaws discover ,
Sometimes he hits it fair , and makes a stroke
But close behind him follows the nightmare ,
To rapture steal its secret way :
Here in the first version follows : --
Too quickly comes the evil day .
To execute the vengeance of its wrath .
With the soul in my eyes hanging dizzily
A break of yellowing clouds , which offers plain
As poet burns came by ,
Swiftly they pass and dull the edge of grief .
There dwells sweet love , and constant chastity ,
Which by the feet of cato once was pressed .
And every sparkle shivering to new blaze ,
To hear the tale , and shadows longer grew :
And let punch and tears be shed ,
And a delighted world received their thoughts
A fairy shape , that seem 'd afar to stand
All valiant dust that builds on dust ,
A flood of brightness rests on thee ,
Of which a double list fell on his breast .
Tyrants fall in every foe !
As lovers to whom time is whispering .
There go the soldiers
White arms to touch the blue .
Had brought all contests to her will ,
The truth in her fulness of splendor will shine ;
Thus the weeping boat made answer :
About the joys the woods do bring ,
Which should have made us doubly kind .
Their dreams of happiness depend
It 's the stillness that fills me with peace .
The lusty bird takes every hour for dawn :
On this great theme kind nature keeps a school ,
( my voice falters as i sing )
Must all come to nothing a hundred years hence .
What profit in our lives is left ?
He would brave when my lip formed a breath ,
But suited to the memories breathing there --
Mute as of old ! days flew ,
It feeds the wound yet known no cure ,
And drank high thoughts to strengthen years to be .
And turn an easy epitaph ?
The martial race , encompassed by this wall ,
That shook the mighty sea from shore to shore ,
And afar rang out his laughter ,
No age can go beyond us ; future times
Full upon the crown it struck him ,
Corruption swelled the public debt ?
Upon the beaming face of joy had dried .
Amid the wrecks that mark the foeman 's path
Kindly entreated , and been brought within
Or cheerful fields resume their green attire .
So that they set the point upon the heel .
To feel the pleasures i possess ,
But virtue hath transform 'd all change to grace :
And a network among the branches made .
Like tears shed over a dream ,
Which let hope wither , and made care thrive ,
The coffee fell and burned her nose .
Will he take back that strength he has given ,
And the day comes again from whence day came .
And bore the drink of heaven away
Of sunny smiles that set in tears ,
Where , tortured by the tempest ’s lash ,
The outer court and wash our tears away
Who draws love 's curtains closely everywhere ,
Next morn there came a bulky document ,
And hatred hid death in the sea ;
That crowns thy darkened evening with its flame !
Two golden talents lay amidst , in sight ,
Untouched thy honey 'd blossoms blow ,
Full oft they met , as dawn and twilight meet
' greatly his opera 's strains intend ,
This made you first to know the why
Much unfeigned love the all to him display ;
To mark your affluent condition ,
To me alone there came a thought of grief :
His plaintive voice comes ringing
Where o'er the meadows springs the maize
That presence filled the garden .
That can get the milk from mana ;
We see the sombre threads that lie
Till life turned drowsy with the ceaseless note ;
Let not your hate in death appear ,
The north-wind shifted and the skies serene ;
Awake , be quenched , ere it can rest .
The crow is waiting to say grace : --
Know how to press the little pulse that dances ,
And makes each nerve , in torture , start ,
Well to the gods ? therefore he stood secure .
Were white with winter , and the day drew nigh
His garments breathed a spicy scent
He was a pagan ; forward went the squire ,
The tall pines bowing where they stand ,
I find i 've been waiting for nine .
It sunk among the foes .
As waters gather in the glen .
Vengeance leaves no gated wall ,
No help to human anguish bring , that bleeds
Breaking the silence , dispelling the shadows
Wherein the gazing heart doubles her might .
But smoky volumes rolling from the ground .
Here , coffin that slowly passes ,
His army ready stood the fight to try ,
And so her cousin , parting , felt .
The dark grave scorns your brightest glory .
Safe in mother 's breast it lies ,
The summer faded , and the skies were hid ,
The thought of her hath made me quite forget
And diamond stars , and mists that float .
The god 's sweet cruel eyes will stare .
The land is ours , the land will keep ,
With a faith which mastered reason .
Their sacred dust shall lie ,
And so make sunshine in the house
Knowledge gained and virtue lost ,
Like fatima , holds the key
He led a host through murk ,
O , the song in its burden ran pure ,
Then follows cleopatra , lustful queen . "
In thy dear self i find --
And shudder into a heap of life that 's made
Let me as reverently cover it
And he regained his lost magnificence
To add to that deep-toned sublime symphony
In the long race which they have run ;
The music of thy nature folded round
And blown in twenty dollars by nine o'clock a.m. ?
An aged oak its shelter gave ;
How to lose her weight of sorrow ,
If it holds a welcome true ,
Transfused on thee his ample spirit rests .
Too lofty for language to reach .
Her tattered cloak more tightly draws .
And he therto sawh time and place ,
So the dark shadows deepen in the trees
To set on fire whoever bars his road .
Oft him they eyed with fear ;
And squeak , goes the rat .
The peaceful winds a holy silence keep ;
And dismal ruin seems to threaten it . "
But tears stood in petite annette 's blue eyes .
Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air ,
As the occasion will allow . proceed .
The fire refuseth to consume . it springs ,
And the merciful men , their religion enhancing ,
The moon descended still .
She felt a curious rapture in her pain .
Made to rock the infant 's cradle .
Decrepit winter , from the south to bring
Though cruel fate should bid us part ,
Sitting at ease , their glances fell
Has left his crown and throne ,
Poor toys to soothe such anguished pain .
The monarch to pontonus gave the sign .
Mine is weary , and ready to break .
He all the country could outrun ,
Flashing leaped into the sunshine ,
Surging with spring that seeks the sea ,
Pounding the sail , which jangled and leapt again .
Because our flesh stood most in need of him .
The glorious tidings spread ;
The path that leads where , hung sublime ,
Its flood of mellow thunder rose , until
He has fairly earned his season of rest ;
And men still live who bore that heat ,
Lips estranged withhold their kiss ?
The lovely chariclea , strikes her dead ,
Great nature strives to find a human speech .
Where sleep and silence guard the soft abodes ,
And love that keeps the music , fills
Until his hour should come ; because the lords
Quarrel on quarrel followed from that night ,
Nothing doubting the multitude , struck with amaze ,
But bore me gently to a leafy land :
Shall lead a life serene and fair ,
Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air ,
The nations shall take note . his unripe age
Nevermore here shall the dark things assail them ,
The hero , as her tears outwelled .
Our liberty from virtue -- pray go on .
Life pays the soul whose confidence endures ,
This ghost , which does not make afraid ,
The breeze wafted back from her forehead fair
Which there had hung for fifteen years or more ,
And leave the rest to fancy 's dream .
Such as cast a sickly blight
Can gladness bring again to me .
A child the moment when it drains the breast ,
The gentle sleep that round my senses clung ,
The total came
The moon got tangled in the trees .
How little of the past would stay !
In mystery mute descends this power 's striving .
Their messages of love to bear ,
And words on which no silence grew .
As they run the blue skies under ,
Where once strode johnny walker -- water goes .
And dipping water , made the evening prayer .
Nine christmas presents ranged in order straight ;
May come here and try his fortune . "
Must yield its gloomy power ;
Permanence hangs by the grave ;
Still , the hovering voice unshed ,
Answer in the words which follow :
For clues to lead to money . and he finds
The rigid interdiction , which resounds
Billy felt his taunting breath blown in his face .
And sees the sligo ships put home ,
With ravening flames , were filled with dread .
Of girlhood 's balmy morn had vanished ;
To urge his cause ? the same wherein i learned
He 's getting up a miracle this minute .
Those eyes that make beholding lips quite water ,
Fair italy , while the heavens above are rolled .
By two misfortunes made the third in fame .
That one might almost say her body thought . '
The fierce hand crushed through flesh and bone ,
Pray let us take the air , "
Oliver feels that death is drawing nigh ;
Fair be the garden where their loves may dwell ,
Thus bound to silence and confin 'd
Fate , rising as a shoreward sea ,
And all the shapes in which beauty goes
Panic , despair , flee away .
And there your politics go round --
In virgin love , to find their joy thereby :
And a pale pathway that the moonlight made .
That each again takes courage , each takes arms .
To gather riches and great store of treasoure
If these eyes would give one transient gleam ,
Which thunders down with headlong force ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
The unabashed city birds plighted their vows ,
Hah ! the hooded death has missed !
O that at length our age would raise
For christmas morn had come and brought
And forthwith battle follows fierce and fell .
By those brief words , accompanied with smiles ,
That breaks itself on that which it encounters ,
It holds me up in days of helplessness ,
Or when mild autumn walked the rounds ,
A phantom out of voidness drawn .
The morning lit , the birds arose ;
And know ' st the deep intents which hidden sit
Shines brighter in the memory of the world ,
The mountains tiptoe to confound me ,
And while the crickets fife along her march ,
And memory and all that time can teach
Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound
The minutes go like april cloudlets past .
No hope appears of fortune 's beams
Its boundary stone that clings so deep in time .
It strikes at the beaten man ;
The hardy veteran after struck the sight ,
And oh the roses that gather around !
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
To death i with one only comfort go ,
The fiends who yet were left with life ,
Happiness in his power left free to will ,
Answered in the words which follow :
That tell us solemn secrets of ourselves .
And turning the old year 's tillage
Send down on their pleasure smiles passing its measure ,
The winds blew fresh , the bark returned ;
It happened once , in that brave land that lies
He sees we stand for peace and truth
With her anchor clutching hold of the sand
The moral elements of life comply ;
Lost in a convent 's solitary gloom !
To these the glorious artist added next ,
Nae travel makes him weary .
But he , which felte a man above ,
And cast the kingdoms old
At last he sees the guiding light of home ,
It drives them : hope of rest to solace them
Oh come , thou only joy undying , death !
The work , as sir sampson legend would say ,
Swearing , unless i took all patiently ,
And when evening comes with its beautiful smile ,
His pride hath lost the praise his prowess won ;
The silence that waits in the rayless void ,
But still the hope experience taught to live ,
When something made him pause :
The darkness might be lifted , and the soul ,
For grain with whole world doth compete ,
Till the utter race be run ;
Took glory in the great repose ,
But as no voices call 'd for battle ,
I will not make him melancholy .
And snatch a fearful joy .
For an answer ; who can give it ? '
Turn 'd and drew constance closer to his heart ,
Clear the current eddied .
All bared to the winter shiver ,
On him a sad and smiling look she cast ,
And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise ;
The wise hebrew warriors . then word they carried
Away to the west as the sun went down ;
Stand fast , great britain !
Without a sound to tell their tune .
Where far it rolls in its calm and grandeur ,
( for well he knew what panic threatened still )
She shines on thieves on the garden wall ,
Or only caught as dreams , to die
Till , by the fervent heat assailed ,
The bonds of love hold stronger .
And i thought of a thundering flag unfurled
Whom , fasting long , his dauntless courage leads
The awful noises reached their height ;
Where the stiletto pierced the skin ;
Where fortune newly smiling , points the way .
Two links of love awhile untied
With a stain that makes me hate the light .
From reading of poems that smoothly flow ?
And to bring a faint blush on her cheek .
The name , that springs forever in my breast .
There the breaking strain was reached , for
And fresh-blown roses washed in dew , "
Though our faces they be often streaked with woe ;
Those british chiefs whom former wars had crowned
Dispensing death , and drove the furious blast ;
But being absent , love lies languishing .
The world 's great oracle in times to come ;
The son of god appears in human love .
Then next i filed a bill to set aside
From all that youth had dreamed or manhood planned ,
And him to mercy towards the wretch inclined .
And helmed chiefs , by gentle sleep subdued ;
Or sends the quivering light afloat
Across the sky the moon will go ;
Of gloom the winds that in them breathe ,
The blush of shame was gone as on his face
And fixed all smithfield 's marveling eyes :
And sorrow 's shafts fly thicker ,
Where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face ,
When the night had on the earth descended ,
For giving the racing a rest .
I abominate passion and wit makes me ill .
Methought last night love in an anger came
And peace descended as a cloak ,
And all true lovers that go thegither ,
That burden , heavier than the earth to bear ;
Day and night my thoughts shall hover
We hold communion with the real .
To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow .
Just truth enough to show that his whole life
To leave the wide world desolate .
Which consumed the new bank building ,
His hot flushed cheeks , or lifted wantonly
And haggard than a vice to look upon .
It found its music in my lady 's voice .
And for thy life preserved by mine ,
Light flowing , from whose amber-seeming waves
Before they break the sword ;
We watch those yellow tapers shine ,
To his protector 's wonder now expressed ,
As bubbles that swim on the beaker 's brim ,
While fear went forth from mine eternity .
Among the rare wonders that caught every eye ,
Will ever wean me from my error .
Nothing 's gained by hurry -- holy
Enkindled , and the one that first had come
Had smothered down her shrieking ,
O'er each blind moment hangs the funeral pall ,
But he met the applause of the good .
A storm stooped on the place of tombs
Else might she still have clung to her despair .
And there in gay attire they strayed ,
Such ills would never have come to pass ,
Renewed our lost courage and dried up our tears .
The coachman said , " your spirits cheer !
" beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root .
Its kindly fruit shall quickly bear ,
Blossom covers the world .
Of stone , he wound his way .
The hope time ne'er destroys --
Of duty that endures for aye :
With tears we 'll water flowers that never fade
The singing seasons divide and depart ,
Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind ,
But fill me with the old familiar juice ,
Celestial stars proclaim thy heavenly birth !
The summer flies it mightily attracts .
The boughs gave way , and did not tear
This made me happier , and i try
The night came hurrying up to hide
Where thy songs will not be scattered
To throw a perfume on the violet ,
By which alone a power is given
It fills me full of fears ;
That has passed over : so this may depart !
My carriage met the carriage of a young man .
Most heart-felt pleasure , leaving peace behind .
And shine over an army with no slain ,
Over the face of the leader came ;
And all the air was so with sickness stored ,
Until the charm be made complete
Kissing them , fanning them , soft and sweet ,
From the north-east came an eagle ,
Lifted by memory all that i met
Its vital part to take .
All seasons could control ;
Iron blossom of frost is bound for ever . "
His rib was made a wife .
O how her fear did make her colour rise !
Legends they that once were taken
Amid the battling blast of all the winds ,
Long silence followed -- then again
In blindness cleaving to their errors , caught
' here innocence may wander , safe from foes ,
The greeks get all by fulsome flatteries ;
Of lamp and torch disperse the night . ”
Yet still its pure simplicity you see ;
What mournful scenes arise :
Watched and recorded all that truth could see .
His jaws uplifting from their fell repast ,
Breathed once again and deemed forgiveness near .
Bright as the sunshine that june roses bring ,
They have missed the acquirement of riches ,
A name he was proud to bear .
Ravenna hath maintain 'd this many a year ,
That touch a possible delusion -- wrought
But he found that guns would preach
That checked , mid-vein , the circling race
And hands and voice together raised in prayer ,
Each of his mission makes report ,
His guest took occasion to say ,
Whose marge e'er wistful waves lap listlessly ,
I should have been too glad , i see ,
And fix 'd the fortune of the doubtful day ;
His body will make me a nice little stew ,
And tufted vernal to pitch its camp !
By the terror breathing from her aspect fell ,
His sighs portend his near impending fate .
The boughs will get new leaves ,
Stay in the heart , it lives .
Her shroud for a new sheet i 'll take :
We have read what history tells us ,
From summer 's hand his stores of angry sway ;
With sudden jangle checked the rising tears ,
For his slain sire , of whom had tidings come
Deepened and swelled to music clear and loud ,
Is sullied in the stream ; taking a taint
But fondly overcome with female charm .
Startles of water made the swing ports gush ,
Reflects the rapture and the grace
Fresh as a lark mounting at break of day ,
The virtue of their valiance shall remain ,
Of blindness , hung as a pall ,
That made the grove so passing sweet .
That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow ,
Has brought the sweetest gift of life ,
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight ;
Now reaching high a chilly hand
Then comes the following stanza , afterwards omitted :
A grief immortal took her , and she grieved
I grant that poetry 's a crying sin ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
The donkey asked a common 's lease .
But one vile christian slave that lay
And she made answer " endless sorrow ! "
If crystal streams " with pleasing murmurs creep , "
Doubt not , to greatness grew , and rome became
Death alone can bring eternal peace !
The fear of death -- alone finds place .
May arise with the gael
This leo will for thee some snare have spread :
Aside to leave the fierce sky visible ;
The thoughts that led and souls that lighted mine .
Abandoning their barks , had made retreat .
He , as his master erst instruction gave ,
Loved , when the year its course had rolled ,
Thus the harmless hare makes answer :
The little leaves that tremble down ,
Evil can but serve the right ,
Where the budding gnomons throw
To tell you how the world goes on
No partner now to sooth my aching heart ,
The floods break their prison ,
Across the bay the squadron homeward came .
And pity dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear .
The candles fall a-dying ,
For i bring thee tidings new ;
Puts equal tax on all the nation ;
Whilst from the wind that swept the answering trees
With strong faith gleaming through the tender tears
Who hold as we this chartered sin abhorred ,
To realms that lie afar ,
But the low voice spoke still lower : --
And every smile on my cheek should turn
So still lies the ocean -- to hear the beat
The long-lanced battle let their horses run .
The hand that clipped his wings ,
Attuned to meet the spacious music of the spheres :
Would to a happy issue bring
Now dimmed and gone ,
I give my spirit to the flood of song :
Some unknown channel lend , where nature spreads
By peter 's soul that hath the key ,
And blooms have blown ;
Then it makes a star , --
The dauntless band full knightly stood on defence anew .
To the string he fits the groove .
Go on , sir ; my attention is a trap
Recall lost realms . no soul can understand
God made the sexes to associate :
That made a garret of wholesome herbs ?
Monopoly , whose mandate took from toil
Noting the visages of some , who lay
To council where the wisest sit .
Thou to whom such praise is given ,
Twelve moons have waned , and the morn is come
Let me but feel thy look 's embrace ,
And out from his spirit flew death ,
The low grass loaded with the dew ,
The scotchman put his stone ,
Of burnished mail the sunbeams throw ,
Into his dead corpse they breathed their spirit ;
Soon the sun 's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
And step for step they followed , dancing ,
That my vengeance shall not reach him ! "
Are life 's delight and depth reveal 'd .
Their spirits bend not to the conqueror 's yoke ,
As he propos 'd to give a party ;
The weaker warrior takes a lighter shield .
In order placed , they patient wait
And combat till the count lay low .
Whose hand is stretched forth upon her ?
His chronicle with curses fit .
And woodlands sing and waters shout .
Was cast from life 's autumnal bough .
While life unrolled us its very best .
That soothe its weariness to death .
What then doth make the element so bright ?
As after thirst , which made thir flowing shrink
" does n't it rub off the bloom ? "
Your memories rising glide silently by me .
To ráma all her heart she gives ,
Ere her leaf can cast a shade .
To keep a steady heart !
A moving sphere where spirits kept their trysts .
Grapes which may never swell the tale of wine ,
So i wait for my ship to come in .
Then made a push , got through the hall ,
And laid his brawny biceps bare ,
That , when truth came from heaven to earth ,
Our hero to the office went , }
For i must speak what wisdom would conceal ,
The winter passed ; another summer warmed
That , surveying all your looks ,
Our deeds avail not ; and our dreams are thrust
I see before me the gladiator lie :
I cool the lambent air upon my breast ,
That brought the limit of her weary woe ,
Must wander thirty-fold for all the time
Aye find the dame complaint with their prayer .
Out of this river issued living sparks ,
And gives his children kisses then , not stripes .
And hear the monotonous hours clang negligently by .
And tropic blooms , and vases caught
To save his little bluebell from betrayal .
For the time runs to waste ,
White frost that hovers round my heart ,
Violets make the airs that pass
Sir king , and him to his destruction led ,
My memory holds a tragic hour to prove ,
Give her not greatness . for great souls must stand
Nature made in roughest mold
This last farewell to guha gave ,
But laughter kills him and he dies at tears .
Slowly across the chequer 'd shadows pass .
More dooms that prayers nor sighs can break --
There came to his grave-side ,
The spring will chill , the heart will freeze .
Chill came the tempest 's lour ;
But all of the things that belong to the day
I may have run the glorious race ,
And thunder echo to the trembling sky ;
Before i rise to some diviner birth :
I bring you life and the beauty of the plains
The wind that makes harps of the forests
That made the rubies dim .
In terror she cried , letting sink her
Hast found it : for this silence , filling now
Followed as fast as a horse could fly ,
I am their foe , and called a curse ,
When the daylight fades , and the shadows fall
Here teems with revolutions every hour ;
As mortal attributes immortal make ;
Take thou my blessing , thus , and go
She blew him kisses till he passed the turn .
Amidst this array comes the solemn thought stealing ,
And in the dreary scene i drew
That it ten draught horse burdens had conveyed ;
Foregoes not what she feels within ,
" there sing our songs till we fall asleep ,
Its plaintive murmurs seem to say
When others doze , oft make them wildly start :
Because i have changed in my feelings towards you
Then follow his brilliant example ,
A sudden madness leaped along his nerves ,
And death is scattered broadcast among men .
Where the great wall round china goes ,
No , no , this sorrow shown
Quickened his fancies , stirred his heart as well ,
Some think we could have stood war 's test ,
A knight whose pledge hath left me dead .
How from earth came vegetation ,
The brightest wit can find us ;
To-morrow led forth for death .
How life since then hath lost its flowers !
That ( heaven alone can tell the reason )
Our faith and patience ; wherefore should we leap
When happiness holds me close to his heart ;
All saints to give him sight of madeline ,
The morning air like those thin clouds that turn
The gods on thee for aid may call .
Till it touched the top of heaven ,
With earnest thoughts tumultuous them observed ,
The ravens fill the sky ,
Then let memory tell thy heart :
Like crystals cling
Or the way he makes his prayer .
His jaws uplifting from their fell repast ,
Flutters of snow came aimless upon flaws .
And not a friend to cheer the lonely place ,
I sketch your world exactly as it goes .
Toil only gives the soul to shine ,
The winds awaken , the leaves whirl round ,
Upon the firmament where once it rode ,
The land that the lord 's love rests upon ;
Only a desolate field that lay
And as the summer wind stole listlessly ,
Great agamemnon then the slaughter led ,
And years have flown since i came out !
The secret love that all my being stirred ?
And when the storm of war was gone
Voice after voice caught up the song ,
And suddenly the past had grown
Hacks us thus cruelly , slivering again
Sing as they tripped a lilting round
Sights that made the unsighted appear ,
Could it go get a stick ? "
In the hazy sunshine , the garden remembers april ,
For him the flowers of trust and faith unfold ;
As they seek their native earth .
The laws that rule the vánar kind ,
Quieter than the clouds that flow
Hills of the west , that take
Nor pity felt for psyche 's tears and moans ,
To meet the battle : nay , the trumpet call
By power which beamed omnipotent , she bowed ,
And need not get into a passion ,
With help he once more gained his trembling feet .
The duties on a king that fall ?
Highway , stretched along the sun ,
The yew will flourish where the lily fades ;
Was worn above to cloak despair .
Seemed in that smile to pass before me .
Of battle shall hereafter meet a check .
And shook it forth with a royal will .
The nineteenth autumn has come upon me
That pain had worn away :
Hence to deep acheron they take their way ,
I placed my trust in women next ,
With wild honeysuckle that creeps and clings ,
What shall divide ? the god within the mind .
Our race of existence is run !
The splendor falls on castle walls
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
Before they reach 'd a spot to take effect :
But feel compelled the commonwealth alone
Where is the land with milk and honey flowing ,
The water dwells a multitude , whose sighs
The flames that it has lit .
But all their courage oozed away ,
And make a vow to break her chain ,
I took compassion on her , bade her steep
And answer came there from the creeping gloom ,
And gave a tinge to every pleasure .
Which love makes for thee !
Hosts follow hosts , and troops succeed to troops ;
O that her grace would my wished comforts give !
The feet of fearnaught went faster still ,
Rock and forest piled to heaven ,
Had fortune my last hope betrayed ,
But never with the slayer 's malice fired :
Each charm it wore in days gone by .
Forlorn and frail , with all her courage fled .
I made bad worse : to liquor flew :
One of the brightest wealth has bred .
She draws an ace , and sees it red .
That outraged faith has entered in his name .
Thro ' verdant pastures move along ,
Gabriel , and michael , and him who made
" which mild october did produce ,
By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies .
But the men will follow her all the day .
That shone as heavens light ,
The folded valley lay
The flower which the wind has shaken
And shining places where the sea-streams lie .
While life remains to it prepared to outface
The next loud blast that he did give ,
For thy rejoicing made .
With heart sadly stirr 'd ,
So linked & locked in strife they lay
Thou hast found a noble suitor ,
And gifts presenting to his sceptred hand ,
Prussia pressed paris , polish protection proffering ,
Around him rose the bare , discolored walls ,
This the answer that i gave him :
Today of all days a miracle will take place :
And deathly odours crept about ,
The radiant morn resumed her orient pride ;
And yet across my mind it rush 'd
And awful death in that hour swallowed him
And , crushed by blows which none might stay ,
What depths of woe your pitying eyes have seen !
His own and the monarchy 's rival withstood ;
Comes a pause in the day 's occupations
What coin divine can make our wage as theirs
To learn the truth employs his every art .
The busy bee , to gather honey , goes
Dead are the lips where love laughed or sang ,
And held the mind in perfect mood ,
Can aught that mind bestows on toil
And from a heart grown reconciled
Of her who had garnered wisdom from the years ;
Is glad with summer . deep in shade it lies
For i gave heed unto the names of all
By the late sun caressed ; slight hazes shroud
That desperate grasp thy frame might feel ,
The glamor stays if the reason goes !
Or theories to expound about ,
The grave has swallowed , down from adam , pass
Drove me to the dregs of life .
It hideth the harsh furrows that the wheels
Though the scenes of past years as they rise ,
Depriv 'd their bridegrooms of returning light .
O mighty mars , whose nod directs the fray ;
Sidelong odors , that give life
I in this territory caught a bliss " ?
When the winds rise and break their mirror there .
There came dreams and yet again dreams ,
But in good time true merit leads the van
Might to the world be opened . high my heart
Nor wonder i , at such profusion shown ;
With hot cheeks and sear 'd eyes
So made his moan ; and darkness falling , sought
The sugary fruits it bears , -- for oh ,
Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise
That alights on misery 's brow ,
Waves roar : collected in himself , the peer
That brought the fog and mist .
Employ thy youth as i employ my age ;
Her way may lie thro ' rough distress !
In quest of wretchedness perversely strays ;
Her lips ope to an angel 's tongue ,
Though sleep benumb her
There came the sound and odour of the sea ,
Where the reefs arise from ocean .
He hath taken all my glee ,
From all the world considers joy or care ,
Like the memory of music made by streams ,
And leave its shadows round my caverned eyes .
Weary went the old witch ,
For learned men shall then take place ,
And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away .
Thy lord and chieftain shalt thou see . "
And peril of impending death withdrawn :
To win her grace whom all commend .
And daybreak brings a touch of frosty wool ;
With all their foreheads drawn in roman scowls ,
The liberty i now presume to take ;
Regained its bed to sink again to rest ,
From the north-east came in anger ,
Draws all the strong seas following .
From running save where virtue leads the way ;
To the eyes that shine and wound ,
Her sacred beauty from my songs that burned .
With summer 's voice come bearing summer 's gifts .
That peace which leaves not holy ground .
When thus the briton made reply :
A day is set for all to die :
As loose the bonds or make them strong
Within her are the fires that wax
But the cheerful spring came kindly on ,
Though foes made double what they heard of all ,
The costly ransom took of hector 's head .
Make content and ease thy aim .
From some rash words dropped then in argument ,
And give my wizard all his hire . "
We thank thee we can face this test
He stood amidst columbia 's sons ,
And then he made a safe retreat ,
Teares shall take comfort , and turn gemms
So it really is wiser to give your consent ,
The love and pity made their voices faint
There shone a glory his ringlets out .
That ever death so many had undone .
Mountain-airs caress the cheek ,
And found him excellent in arms and arts .
All the fair petals banished from the sun .
How little weight my words with thee can find ,
The jealous strokes upon their helmets bite ;
And drowning uttered : " this condition
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night .
The darkness of the wood stood still
From her lips rushed the wildest of sighs ,
The child of grace his hands puts forth ,
And virtue strives in vain to match it .
Behold where the red dawn is breaking !
But with one bark escaped the wretched fay .
Of glittering shafts the chieftain bore .
Than those which custom and the gods allow .
Death brought no terrors to his heart ,
The heat and toil , and smiling aspect wears ,
While down his cheeks the salt tears run .
Gave him a look that seemed to say :
So well content to look upon her daughter ,
Like crimson meteors hang in the gloom ,
The weak wind whispers to the day that dies .
But left more sweet than roses to respire ,
Till the mass scatters as the winds arise ,
Loud and more loud the tumult went
At times throughout those caverns rolled , --
The senate 's mad decrees he never saw :
Or makes miss-cues for want of chalk .
That in thee lives harmony ,
That downe their weapons instantly they lay ,
Which once made pisa famous , long have lain
Then hoary , chilling winter shrouded pale ,
What desolation then is felt ,
And in did come the strangest figure !
With words of fire it called her ,
That made the glory of that dead time ?
It grew ripe summer , when one morning came
Eternity high converse held with time ;
Their noses brought them news of riot ,
Of honour win me rest from strife ,
The chord of memory , found full many a tone
That scorn to bend beneath this weight of years --
A rabbit works its ears , and tries
While the autumn breezes sing .
Winter sits at ease :
Then incense swung by priestesses ,
The glory of her lilies lost .
The moonlight leads her as she goes
He built her bower of freshness there ,
Th ' almighty victor to spend all his rage ;
As the lashes of light that trim the stars ;
With love he fills the spring-time air ;
As if my treasure and my wealth lay there ;
And lights were paling out of the west ,
Night has gone out beneath the hill
That o'er the green corn-field did pass
Upon whose sides had many a club been broke ,
The forests groan , -- the heavy gale
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
Like the new moon thy life appears ;
For which i let slip all delight ,
Truth has put an end to hope .
As my lost boyhood is to me ?
And laughing flipped it in the air ;
The fury of its might , descend ? ”
The sculptor to make beauty by .
The spring will come when the year turns ,
And with his gentle influence brings
When news comes to the castellan
Onward the blessed legion swept ,
Thy work undone ; and with insulting scorn
The soft winds go and come
Are instruments of salvation , yet they take
A signal flung that put the stars to flight ;
Is founded on the silent heart of god ,
That blows foreseen are slow to fall ,
So my soul held that moment 's heaven ; --
That rosebuds find
Some boon of strength has nature given .
Of my chaste thoughts , by drawing them aside ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Who 'll pass her memory by .
And what was left when that had passed by ,
Much space the morals take .
The screaming legions wheel , and mount the wind .
To ease tir 'd disappointment 's bleeding heart ,
" a few small tricks you now shall see .
With these alluring words invokes his aid ;
Rumours of wars had reached this peaceful vale ,
Round about which the primal wheel revolves , --
Lives for more honors , and by honors covers
' a soul has gone to god , '
These crown and caress thee and chain ,
King james 's june is ever spent .
And found no end in wandering mazes lost .
Yon nightingale 's notes which in melody meet . "
Which rode on the silvery mist of the heath ,
And the chalk took again from his pocket .
Life treads down love in flying ,
Brightest it shines , but ominous , and dire
The daisies come starring with white and gold
And so it was i drew her .
And let another rousing cheer for tennessee be given ,
Fast-locked , and fill with fear . "
To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal .
For thee that great deliverance wrought .
The wind went wooing the rose ,
Around the lattice their tendrils spread ,
The fate appointed by revengeful crete .
Faced by love 's congregated worshippers ,
And there follow 'd some droppings of rain :
Which soon took us home to rhine-land
Now others hold the sway he held , --
The sullen season now was come and gone ,
What may be gained and what be lost .
Our hearts recall the distant day
The chain i gave was fair to view ,
Erroneous , which in blazing ruin fell
The south wind knows my longings
The high hill birches shine like purple plumes ,
And all the war descends upon the wing ,
In modern days such feats no more we see ,
Where the crystal battlements rise ?
Holding a conversation with my pen .
Unto their master , which it of them sought ,
Till it arrives at the great goal of all .
Her lost and wandering ones recall ,
Their minds to bear the wounds they feel ,
To give her weather room .
For he bears an ancient wrong about him ,
" let earth and heaven go on their way ,
That to my will gave wings ; and i began
Brings forth the buried meaning from its grave .
And the rippling waves where the waters run
" and ere five years were fully come and gone
As the bread that rye is yielding .
The prince ’s wearied army lay
That for my faults ye will me gently beat .
Some , when the springtime had grown to december ,
A solemn prayer , conceived in agony ,
And , goaded by his rage and hatred hot ,
A prayer for one to guide and save ,
The moon stands blank above ;
The clang of weapons flew to heaven , which heard
Ay , greater the marvels this age shall find
Little sorrows sit and weep .
Beauty no pencil , beauty 's truth to lay ;
Death , i say , my heart is bowed
Into her room , -- it did not bear
Alas , thy patience strangely tried i see ,
Let go a music , as of tunes
Thy faith has earned thee in the skies ,
That gentle france be not brought to shame .
Her hopes of bliss and rapture shatter 'd so .
Though autumn 's rustling leaves have spread
Withdraw awhile , that we may all take counsel ,
Bearing our joys away , and bringing woes .
With drooping wings , and eyes of faded fire ,
Round about him spun the landscape ,
Spring 's earliest nurslings spread their glowing leaves ,
Exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold ,
Swift as a whirlwind , drives the scattering foes ;
And then you see the spherical light that lies
And melting virgins own their love .
And the young winds fed it with silver dew ,
She waited while the summer went :
And the copper-bells rang music ,
That night we felt our love would hold ,
Cast without cease into the beauteous source ;
With trembling doubts that fast fought ( struggled ) .
Transformed to youth , a lovely columbine !
To bring salvation down .
Her office holds ; of all external things ,
But some wild dream is sent to fray me .
To fill this page 's span ,
“ care for thy own paternal heaven may move .
Holding perpetual feasts , while golden youths
" i will not further press the painful tale .
To our torment has given an end .
In vain a rival barred his claim ,
Light they come and light they go :
Serv . well , thou wilt see
Whence bodies struggled outward , -- of supposing
That tyrants impose , with their minions combined ?
To see the blow , to feel the pain ,
In the very words which follow ,
My love of you leaps foaming in my breast ,
It will neither hold out winde nor raine ;
Her anger was subdued by greater grief ;
Day passed ; the shades of night drew on ,
At feet of writhing trees . the violets raise
But rain spoiled all . the day began uncertain ,
Of wind that rose and smote against the oar ,
Through me you pass into eternal pain :
And were only glad to escape his wrath .
At eve , cool shadows fall
And filled with beauty , dreaming and devout ,
Fierce from his mountain-eyrie downward drove ;
And your eyes and the moon swept the valley .
Business could not make dull , nor passion wild ;
Could hate have shaped a demon more malign
To welcome infant spring .
And yearning cries : let come thy kingdom ,
And sin would i fight ,
That keeps us live . the holy maid who sat
Adonis , as would keep him from the chase
Thou and thy warriors follow where i lead :
Or barbarous , nor exception hath declared ;
From joys that diminish , and woes that increase ,
Stay , for a tint of green shall creep
Regained its bed to sink again to rest ,
' pope anastasius is within me thrust ,
And his tongue shall be filled with praise .
That famous epic which his muse had hit on ,
Thought her predictions went not much amiss ,
To art ennobled shall have grown , --
Till destruction comes upon them .
The great procession swept .
Though pain may come , it can not harm ;
Which brought us hither ,
Lest they should break the compact they had made .
My old sorrow wakes and cries ,
Then he lets fall his bale of coloured words .
To make a solemn trial of our skill .
He turned his wheel and deftly plied his trade ,
This is the fountain : once it flashed and sang
And all that sat by the fire were sad ,
With strings of questions cut and dried
Voice moved ; -- only the torrent broke
And they send counsel : weep with rainy grief ,
This fad has swept throughout the land --
That florence gave the renaissance to rome .
As old time makes these decay ,
To hold things fitting my necessity ,
Rough ashes sat he for his soul 's reprieve ,
To temper the deceitful ray .
Where the desperate charge was led ,
Swallows will flit round the desolate ruin ,
Yes --- once again with joy i find
As coming from thy power and from thy goodness
His ready smile a parent 's warmth expressed ;
Flowers have time before they come to seed ,
The song is heard , the rosy garland worn ;
For when my arm to its true distance came ,
Blossoms that the summer glosses
Its shadows never turn .
The flush of life may well be seen
The star of evening sheds its trembling light ,
Its point was still turned to a flying foe .
More suddenly than doth a moment go ,
Dim the quiet alcoves grow .
She falls to execution .
" i 'll give him education :
And blazoned banners toss ! "
And stopt the settled course that action drew ;
The prince , astonished , gave consent ,
For soon the sunny stream of youth runs down ,
More dark than any ray of sun can pierce ,
Take my advice , with these to battle go ,
Or take from old england a pitiful bribe ,
Where crystal rivers feed unfading flowers ,
Till to a junction on the crest they drew .
All that the human heart most fears or feels ,
Weeping ; and so find kindness to her healing .
Was touched with a violet 's breath .
Grow rich in that which never taketh rust :
And make a shroud out of their suffering ,
Thy beauty i clung to ,
The way it goes , the way it comes ;
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street ,
Of europe conquers to redeem the east .
Within which nothing wrong could dwell ;
And cried as loud his voice he raised :
Before whose night an earlier sun sunk down .
Nor chide the man whose honest doubt extends
Her blown locks , took my soul in mesh ;
Love which god 's heaven encouraged -- love that drew
In slumber cold at night shall lie ,
In that blest vision , nothing could estrange
And low , still scattering yellow flowers and red ,
Nor tamed by manners , nor by laws confined :
Answered in the words which follow :
Who takes the census of the living dead ,
Against oppression dared to raise the tongue .
' neath trees that thrilled with morning life ;
Ere the early dew can go
So sped the many days of tranquil life ,
Nor find her eyes so bright , so bright ,
An ' the ports where the big ships ride .
Security hast render 'd me , and drawn
But troy for ever reaps a dire delight
Her mantle showed the yellow samphire-pod ,
And when thou tread ' st the vale of death
The sheep had gone from theirs .
Then a speech he made concluding :
Our owner holds us sadly cheap ,
Fierce rang the armour on the warrior 's breast ,
And find forgiveness where the shadows stir
But they left us a kingdom none can take ,
To bring the whole world to its mood serene ,
Then to the sons of grief his speech addressed ,
To break the repose that thy ashes are taking ,
For the high providence , which had ordained
All things mingle ; all things flow ;
And scant and sear the desert grasses nod
In clasping maiden-arms he findeth !
Then added , turning to my guide his face ,
She bids the reed return the way it went ,
Bring life back again to me .
Then indigo , trembling softly into blue ;
From divination where thy merits shine .
Then the thaws swell the streams ,
To feed their eyes upon the promised land .
They sit where their humble cottage stood ,
The saints that in the windows sit .
Lo ! how they sunk to slavery again !
When the mist is weaving and drifting .
How thick the tremulous sheep-cries come !
That three such graces did unto me give .
It passeth vigil and the shadows cleareth .
To mark its structure and to note the scale
And gods were dead but for the life that lies
And gifts presenting to thy sceptred hand ,
This poem expresses a hope in universalism --
Gloomy darkness covers all .
With reverent supplication came ,
And left a light , a radiance to display ,
And wasted by the coldness of the world .
To fame arise ! for what more fame can yield
The song sad recollections bring ;
And yet your touch upon them will not pass .
Since nature suffers only what it knows .
In the strength of a governed soul .
They find the air so fresh and pure .
And distant things go with as . pleasantly
Behind the funeral litter came ,
And for thy lady ’s loss consoled ,
The dervise had known sorrow ; and he felt
The year has seen , the year has seen ;
A shadow cast across his sunburnt face ;
If we scatter sunshine everywhere we go .
That inward burns shows them with ruddy flame
And if those words together link 'd we name ,
Before the long cold clutching fingers of dawn .
They shed thereon no thing funereal ,
They their silver voices gave thee ,
The immanent will that stirs and urges everything
That the time might pass more gayly ,
Held her heart crushed , as in a vice !
Until the hour strikes what must come
So many ladders to the earth they threw ,
Where the old flotilla lay ,
The wise suyajǹa thus addressed :
Our foreheads felt the wind and rain .
Shone bright the rising morn ,
Like arms with manhood ’s tried and steeled
That so his own declining house might stand .
With strings of questions cut and dried
To pass , because their waters gleamed like tears .
How light would lie the turf upon my breast .
Nothing , child , to ease thy pain !
An entity , though modified by flam ,
I had drawn comfort from its smiling grace .
' ah , sons , from evil ways depart ;
Nor nature feel her holy reign profaned
This makes , that circled with distractive fear
Who fill ' st the north with wonder ;
But wisest fate says no ,
For in the ships lie all our bravest late ,
The creature is that god pronounces good ,
The more on icy pavements we are set .
With some sombre lines thrown in between ,
Mute are the voices that responsive rang .
The thought of death alone , the fear destroys .
The ox thou gavest to partake my care .
Nor before love the noble heart was made .
For edinburgh my lord sail never see . ’
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice ,
And joyful welcome to the lusians gives ;
The fame of him her swerving made not swerve .
Take time to be holy ;
And every heart has found its own
What dost thou see ?
And the valleys sing delight .
This done , we 'll draw lots who shall buy
Threading the ranks of earth 's fierce battle field ,
That ever thro ' such hands should pass
A greater gift , since now i see at last
Their strength in single combat tried .
To pull him through the year . '
Fading away , sunk in the western sky .
And breathed a spirit in his rising heart .
How many bars has nature placed ,
And one press 'd firmly on her swelling heart ,
That at her flowery work doth sing ,
My name to me a sadness wears :
Swelling the song that my paddle sings .
With fear they mark the following cry ,
Of fadeless immortality , which shines
The eye which marked its peerless edge ,
If thy path lies yonder , mine is here .
The four great rivers ran ,
My love of her smile has faded quite
To prospects of enjoyment that awaited their return ,
Which reading , writing , speaking teach .
The sleepy bees make hardly any sound ;
And drowned my joy in tears .
And heavenly charms prefer to proffer ’d gold ?
A quiver that the tomb-sweat bore
And all his people ; thunder mixed with hail ,
Its motions stop , or frenzy fire the wheels .
Where wild-flowers welcome the wandering bee ;
So let thy turtle-dove 's sad call arise
Gold and silver much he took ,
When death draws nigh , how miserable they
A sacrifice is of this treasure made ,
In silence they reached over mountain and moor ,
Thy lips have turned to ebony , and paint
Fearlessly ; and enyo level held
Mrs. mallowe sighed and made no answer .
The towering boulders guard it . and the bee
That set them free to seek god 's face
Through open windows came sweet garden smells ,
I 'd handle thee , and comfort thee therein .
So went i through the bitter and foul air ,
Memories come as the daylight fades
Nay , she would shriek and rally --
" hath been reserved to bless thy favored sight ;
Thy heavenly nature recognize ? ”
One by her husband overwhelmed with grief ;
And serves past hours of rapture to recall ,
Colours shine with pure glory ,
That wisdom had evolved with purpose kind ;
With words build up a system neatly ,
Nay , anxious to join the puritan church ,
Life 's burdens and troubles turn into air-bubbles
To take our fill of armoured crime ,
Above , it narrowed to a ravine , fed
The muses ' love since dorian lightning ran
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Stretched out his arm and weeping cried :
The love this friend now bears to me .
Suffrage won ; they melt away ,
As every rising wave his dread renew 'd ;
That lulls a morning dream .
The blow has sent the parent to the grave .
And many a wintry wind have stood
Jane felt for walter ; felt his cruel pain ,
Her life with his made the moments there
In days to come i 'll form a race ,
For one of faith diversified by doubt :
With this good argument my purpose now is fixed ,
The waters swell , the mists arise ,
Take my spirit to thee .
Where the rich wardrobe breathed a costly scent ;
What makes my heart to glow and swell ?
Because the arms that lapped his sinewy limbs
Saw the rainbow vision rise ,
Added a dreadful cry ; and there arose
One wail would rise from cruachan 's halls
All my heart is buried with you ,
Before his eyes in shadows swims the plain ,
And with hasty steps went onward ,
That tells me my happiness centres in thee .
For summer now is come .
To do the feast justice . the gods take delight
The chestnut 's buds into blooms that rips ;
There shall be couches whence faint odours rise ,
A million to five is the price i get --
The painted farm-house shining through the leaves
With flooded eyes , and sorrow-faint ,
And from the conference a bosom brought ,
The future grasping , by the past obeyed ,
They knew not man , and felt no fear ,
The stars stand gazing ,
The dew and heat , whose bubbles make
Vapour adust doth never mount above
Trodden in vain till he regain the path .
And fragrance pure as light floats all around .
They find their heads in heaven ,
Thus honesty at length prevail 'd ,
Then will my heart with rapture burn ;
Blessed are ye that make choice of her ,
In nearer space , like scarlet arrows flew
And the noise in the air the broad words made
And all the joys that wait on fame .
For thou hast made this wondrous soul
And find strange beauty mirrored there ;
My spirit expanded , sweetly embraced
Holding her honor and her name ,
No one has penetrated the secrets of the principle
A patriot 's hand protects a poet 's lays ,
And is love humble , or does he command ?
Ages will come and go ,
Then word comes suddenly , flying fast ,
Which those can grant who heavenly joys pursue .
Thy intellect , detached , expelled and breathed
A most substantial hut , which rose ,
She 'll find those splendid arms and strong
The wreaths of failing smoke declare ,
This which is come to pass , shewed graciously
Hot raged the quarrel ; then came justice in ,
" when the fatal trump shall sound ,
Rent is the flag that late so proudly shone !
No longer chooses to conceal her flame .
Each single heart with myriad raptures filled --
Nor hateful pity , proudly shown ,
Learned company that follows in his train !
Trust that , when morning brings her light ,
With the wounds bare that were not told of ;
To light and life shall spring .
To mark what evils we ourselves be spared ;
And poured the hissing tide :
Lnae ray of comfort shall i see ,
Wilt thou give the bride affianced ?
Conviction to the serpent none belongs .
If you feel disposed for a cropper ;
But my sad eyes their nightly vigil keep .
Two blacks the casket bore .
The soul 's addresses , introduced a system
He groped to know if michael still drew breath .
The longing grew to have and hold you ,
While a month its course was running .
Of the lord , thou wheel , shine warmly ,
The marriage deed by thee was read ;
Of him can harbour unfaith ; soul of him
On the thin brazen notes he threw a prayer ,
And keen the north winds blow :
These ancestral lays unravel ?
Thy reverent eyes shall wear
Mysterious voices moaned and fled .
To set my sin-bound spirit free ,
" the giant form on nature 's centre stands ,
Calmly where the red deaths ride .
What came of her ? the river flows
A spanish squadron lies ;
't is all that heaven allows .
She train 'd the gold azalea , whose perfume
On his leaving to join the army .
For we have lost the meaning of the world ;
Some bearded meteor , trailing light ,
All in whose pulses ran
And i 'd saved him three elegant dances , --
A glove 's flat fingers span the shelf .
If we throw the time away .
The flame had issued , like the flame of life
And i went telling of expatriate tears ,
Kind thoughts in their breasts they smother
Wilt thou not the flow ' rets bind ,
The tempest rushes through the sky ;
And fearful fancies cleave the night
Come to fruition born of sympathy .
Nor solace in defeat , save from that sense
They saw the white sails bearing him away .
Where winter 's angry billows tossed ,
Most noble of all that see the light ,
And sappho , headlong sent , flies just in
Yea ! mournful thoughts like these even now arise ,
Slow travelling with dim eyes suffused with tears ,
To minos down he bore me , and the judge
" the council , which is thought most wise ,
A heart but to propel leviathan ;
Best lay the rhyme , best lead the dance ,
There , where reply to innocence is made .
In bliss that naught may e ’ er destroy .
But quite another part this caesar played ,
Of bounding pulses that stand still and ache
Discovers to exist , therefore it comes
But when she smiles i see its wiles ,
In the stream of life that wander 'd bye .
Under the dark and swiftly gathering gloom
Who would believe such deeds could find a place
Snatch when despair makes human hearts less pliant .
That showered its fiery blossoms ,
The stars that show us god is there ,
And filling us with calm and solemn thought ,
From those gay groups she stands apart ,
Summers gone by , and laughter that is still ,
Whereafter follows arid heat , and he
Then arose a fearful uproar ,
Speak ! and my dying faith shall rise ,
If from the fashions of the world set free ,
This the kind of watch you keep !
An honest man by honest parents bred ,
By sorrow lifted towards her god ;
A fragment of the golden age was cast
But as he was talking he fell fast asleep .
Soon to their monarch came this voice of fate .
The moon rose and a calm wind came ;
That lies a treasure stored by thee .
Now give they victory to our longing hands .
My hatband goes around my hat ,
A rosy color sweeps the sky ,
While love and terror laid the tiles .
The creek which ran below
Ere yet the glimmering landscape sank to night ,
Which all must bear to lovely souls and pure ,
Unites the painter 's fascinating art ;
With speed they guide the vessel to the shores ;
My growing fortune soon should flow ,
And now the centuries have cycled by ,
His fury quiet then and calm he found ,
Now made the stars appear to us more rare ,
She to his mind that promise brought ,
Then loud rose the war-cry for pardon ;
Thus bound in nature 's nakedness ,
Weather and rain have undone it again ,
And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth ,
Twice the sun had mounted , twice had sunk ,
And christian denmark still thinks on
The trust that gives you courage for the fight ;
Now the night was almost passed ,
All day long where the white wings run .
The spirit of the lord is going
Their music beats at heaven 's gates .
A bosom nature gave thee true , --
One atom add of salt ,
For all their brains were pumped away ,
And on him rushed the furious band
And went to sleep once more .
To follow goodness was his plan .
' what will bring the effervescence ,
Answered in the words which follow :
When this sweet sound reached her ears ,
So great a christian never more shall see , '
What , though i can not meet my bills ?
What deep offence has fired a monarch 's rage ?
His mantle tore off , flung the master 's badge
At last the boys had found a cushy job .
That in thy eares thus keeps a murmuring .
He served that law which rules the thrones above ,
A raven which had fought and torn
And a myriad worlds from out the darkness sprang .
Can rise together to augment the bulk
As that the old world thought it fit
Are fallen beyond all recovery
Freedom whom hoarse forests sang ;
On every conscience ; laws which none shall finde
Once again success has crowned
But by extorcion spoyle the pore innocent
Here vapours rise , there clouds float by ,
The last clouds fare
The example followed -- be it good or bad ;
Wherein i first took hold on misery ?
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew ,
Portentous as the lowering front of heaven ,
That pitty never found .
To ferry over the sad world that came . "
What war could ravish , commerce could bestow ,
We bore , as freedom 's hope forlorn ,
Carried a shining primrose air ,
The trembling lawyer thus return 'd :
The going forth of god upon these waters .
And my heart went cold ,
No bodily pang had power to swerve your soul :
Frae worldly care set free .
The yearly seasons rolled along ,
They stayed their weeping , yet with sighs subdued ,
One ripple of silence spreads out from another .
Yet little distance they their prize convey .
To make smooth the path of lovers ,
So snapped at once that music 's golden thread ,
All their wisdom united and cleverness shows ,
Which says embassadors are safe by law :
The things that pass upon the earth we crawl ;
Her lips from mine like echo caught
Whatever passed in rooms in years gone by ;
Oft finding them slatterns void of love ;
Freedom sat there cragged we saw ,
That freedom 's flag shall bear no stain
Nor sorrow may attend thy name ?
But makes each heart its home ,
The heart will break with grief .
Livelier than elsewhere , stella 's image see .
Essays to reach the throne of love .
Science was only meant for man .
As said before . thereafter will arises ;
That tries to race , i still insist
Along whose faint paths went at dawn
Mother vexed , did whip her next ,
Seem nervous torches flourished by the gusts ;
The footstep fluttered me at first : not he :
The clock brings its proofs ;
All my woes dissolve and vanish ,
Thy holy quiet meets the spirit 's eye .
Not without wonder seen . then thus began ,
While thunder 's surges burst on cliffs of cloud ,
When grief comes this way by
“ expiring mortals owe returning life !
First spring of reason , that this globe designed ;
Which no commiserate pity came and cloaked ,
Whereat they raised a doleful cry ,
Roger followed their glances in time to behold
And it answered him as follows :
What hand and brain went ever paired ?
Farewell ! what word could answer but farewell ,
Ah ! you will find this maxim true : --
To break the repose that thy ashes are taking ,
And lo ! the siren shores like mists arise .
The sunset build a city frail as dream ,
Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall ,
With earthly sorrows worn .
To run unanimously fer the presidential cup ;
Gave her the casket , and awhile did stand
Nor her changing cheek , so rich and rare .
“ in fruitful crops the wholesome food will spring .
The maid made answer true ;
Their hearts and ears did greet ,
Like a wing that flits through space .
Full in sight ran on before him ,
Or that of her to whom he might apply :
That can tend thy royal racer .
Hereof you are to give security
And yet a higher joy was now confessed .
A monster , which a woman 's likeness wore .
The spring will come when the year turns ,
And blessings in answer came down from above .
Shiver the mists that hide thy starry lyre ,
I always tremble ; the moments flew
That a second sun might follow .
The money raised -- the army ready --
Led by false sleep , down secret stairs of dreams
It whispers no more of death ;
As unto others his , no sense contain . '
They , who above do various circles find ,
Sad memory , with thy songs to interfuse ?
And ev'ry tender passion takes its turn .
Those change his shape and make it foul ,
There she found it sweetly sleeping ,
And o'er the stile went singing .
A lonely spirit guiding .
On the clear vision nature gave the child .
Like leaves that shadow , flutter on a lawn .
So , while the moon made broad her ring ,
Beneath the sea broke sounding ; and the king
Along the letters ran ,
The silence , and in fury spoke :
The vaults of sky receive . nor thus doth death
Like echo , sending back sweet music , fraught
While tear chased tear in rapid flow . ”
And fierce with grief the awakened heart cries out :
With power to feel and to enjoy it . thou
My heart was shaken with tears and horror
There the bees went for honey ,
And grief goes out , and joy comes in ,
Then bursts the song from every leafy glade ,
Of woman . how to reach with halting words
Unlike the scents that rose and lily cast
A record may to future days remain . "
And love , grown faint and fretful ,
Her will the restless lover surely find :
Love that had turned to bitter , biting scorn ,
Monster ! -- no peace can greet your breast :
So through the present it lingers ,
It passed from mohammed to moses :
My heart would wish it broke before ,
" my purpose went not to develop
The west wind always brings wet weather ;
Why of the heritage no portion came
The light that makes me music of the skies ;
Till with the spring 's warm beams , almost released
As directed by the spirit
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink .
Then burning grief inflamed his eye ,
Brings into bondage . be thou joyous , prince !
We sat beside the water through burning summer days ,
Their captains come , and ask advice from him ,
Describe or fix one movement of the soul ?
She springs beside her lord :
And stirs in all the veins of spring ,
I turn to other days , to men
Again there sweeps the highland clans ,
And i who prophesy shall never see ?
Softly swam the boat that bore our love .
Without a heartbreak , as the hours pass by ?
That can bring thee to destruction ,
Thou art led to fields of flowers ,
The hamlet sites where settling smoke lay curled ,
Have power to shake me as they pass ;
The english monarch gives the listed bounds ,
To thee i make my prayer .
That gives to man or woman
A style is found by sedentary toil
Each shining street , each steeple where it stands ,
From her immortal armour flashed around
And turn with hope and trustfulness to man ;
My senses mazed .
Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed ,
That ever chilled the last night of a felon
O source of the holiest joys we inherit ,
Look ! what thy memory can not contain ,
Ambition here her efforts made ,
The manner of my falling into sleep .
There came a breeze from off the sea :
That all my hopes are fixed on thee .
And wing 'd with terror fly the fatal field .
And now , no longer by the enchantment stayed ,
Was like that music as it came ; and then
Has to fatten on fresh air .
Pointed at her in derision ,
That stands fear-frozen in a wood , --
Till the little lambs leap with delight ?
Thus do my wasted days slip by ,
Blends with the glimmering light that plays
O folly ! for to bear all naked truths ,
That we go on still fashioning
The grey dew keeps no traces of their feet ,
Stood with the holy moonlight falling on you there
Who seeks not stars by day , nor light
And god may feel the same as you .
Of larger scope than our hard measures make ,
To guide them through life 's potent mystery ;
My spirit flew in feathers then
" be your complaints on his kind bosom laid :
A coxcomb claims a high distinction .
To momentary peace it bound
Where small parties aquatic excursions may take ,
But let 's see , by the bye ,
Such health do my fountains bestow ;
That fills the woods with carollings ;
To hold communion with those innocent thoughts
Some beam of comfort yet on greece may shine ,
Infinite the finite extends .
Straightway summoned all his courage ,
Behind , rome 's genius waits with civic crowns ,
If fire be stolen from heaven , it is not
Tow ’ rds him stretched a friendly hand .
The red sun-light lazily lay .
And so the years went one by one ,
Now round the lists the admiring armies stand ,
And terror said , " the time is come
There is calm lying .
Whom rome should place , for charms and chastity ,
Bring the happy voices nearer ;
The demon ’s form he tore and rent ,
The four ambassadors of peace proceed .
It 's too late now to make reply ,
To say the time is come and bid thee rise
By caution ruled , the helm shall guide
The lily kept its gleaming ,
And be his warrant in an age to come .
Would change their bright chorus
For him whose smiles first made her weep ; --
Deep feeling , that found utterance loud ,
But come with the glory of human mind ,
Besides , it wanted but few hours of day :
Gorgeous clouds sail gorgeously ,
And in his hand an olive garland bore .
The gray sky wears again its gold
They hold their regal state ,
Ten years passed on . they parted and they met
Love hung the sun in his high place
As quick a growth to meet decay ,
And the foam is flying free .
Was safe and sound restored by him .
Nor let thy soul give way to doubt :
He sits immortal on a godless earth .
April cold with dropping rain
Ceaselessly veering , shrieks across the sea ;
My heart will travel back again
And strove her love and hot desire to cover ,
That holds a light divine ,
Heart which felt their flames , be silent ! )
Columbus found america and won a lot of fame --
Can but arrest the light and smoky mist
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes .
With the great white lilies that reached to his throat
Whose worth is reckoned by the sum they buy
A fragile thing , her lightest wish was heeded .
Together we have passed some happy hours ,
Each step trod out a lovers thought
Bearing my message , bidding the soul of man arise
That cried to have its chaos shaped :
While tears of joy her utterance broke ,
Your soul shall be perfected till it draw , --
As i have felt since , hand in hand ,
Crossing the waters ) doubt , and something dark ,
To put to rout each tender sentiment .
And every heart for battle burned ,
None left but by submission ; and that word
" the trees its swelling flood shall stay ,
From driven herds the clouds that rise
That empire ) under his dominion holds ,
And glory shone around .
It touched his heart and lit his spirit , too
Why love in lady 's eyes should dwell ;
The vision went , and went the living king ;
And thus to me he made reply ;
There came so loud a calling of the sea ,
Thou art the guide who leads aright ,
One only — - with my son may pass .
Yet , passing where it first sprang into life ,
It takes a hold and seems to reach
Eyes that the rashness of delight reveal :
He shall cut pathways east and west
No seasons set their teeth in it .
May hide the sunset , and the shade
And makes the flowers of fancy brighter .
And slow aneath his closed lids slipped a waft
No voice ; but o ! the silence sank ,
Where the eastern palm-trees stand ;
My life devoted to yours and his ,
For men had traced with blood and tears
That takes an old heartbreak .
Love sometimes is given to sleeping ,
And where men cling to what is right
Wilt thou , lord , stand for me ?
As shoots a nameless terror through his heart .
Ranging all life to sing one only love ,
Their bare arms stretched in prayer for the snows .
That i be reckon 'd till the day i die
Through all her train the soft infection ran ;
' t would give them liberty --
Murmur a melody that tells
With tackle which he kindly lent ,
Laid the whole hopes of his life desolate .
The stately thought its march laborious goes !
To rear thy throne where his alone shall stand ;
Whatever trash _ midwinter _ gave to day ,
For prowess of your hands , that show
Where what is meets with what seems
Has made himself wealthy , and that without trying ;
Or check a stubborn will ,
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
A scene of wonders lay before his eyes .
As the springs to meet the sunshine ,
To find myself here , all alone ,
Your peace that follows after
Striving , aspiring till the shame is gone ,
I know they carry one heart of flame
All recklessly they rush to hear
It aimed to lure us . mountains of the past
What pain could get between my face and hers ?
Ah ! time has fled , and friends have failed
Fellow believers , who have sought a home ,
Waits for the holy hands that took
In a dream i saw war riding the land :
And hours that go on broken wings ,
As the heart that did them make .
My heart came back again :
Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize
Who oft have stilled the raging wind and wave ;
That sends me wandering through the world again .
Cheerful , with friends , we set forth --
My jerry there has left the sea
We two have made the angels smile !
And kitty o'neil -- the snow lies white
Sank the sun on his death-bed .
Clouds , low suspended , seem to embrace the foam
By the day would lose its light ,
And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue ;
Her measureless days to fill .
That we may come unto his bliss ,
Thrice happy in whose heart pure truth finds rest .
Whence issued forth the blood by judas sold ,
The blue eyes beamed , in showers
The pale grief sitting on the brow ,
Man 's fitful uproar mingling with his toil ,
In rain descending from the sky :
Upon me , my despair looked forth so cold
With paragraphs all got by heart ,
Peacefully the monster journeyed
It fills the church of god ; it fills
Triumphed and rose above the languid sea .
Here would they take their stand . from furthest east
From the lonely station passed the utterance , spreading
Which none can see , though all find true .
With breath hastily drawn , and cheering smile ,
I held my breath and improvised a prayer :
When sweet airs come seaward
Seeking some comfort for an aching mood .
Hence came the altar all of gold ,
Nor how to trust her can i see ,
Were forced thy conquering might to own .
As smouldering ashes dimly show
Of shattered dwellings , to take the brunt
Love me : we will pass and part ,
And crete will boast the labyrinth , now raced ;
The dim sun slips adown the sky
All perils , and his exile shared .
That breaks itself on that which it encounters ,
And half our joys renew ,
To join the great assembly came .
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
That makes the leaves rejoice .
But what the editor demands he shows ;
Love is made out of ecstasy and wonder ;
Hast thou not felt her sunshine on thy face ?
And hear her laughter ringing through the trees .
Whose base hand dealt a coward ’s blow ,
Like green leaves caught with flames by his impress .
Who list the tale to carry ,
But these shall pass and perish in the dark
Flora , blown by breezes north ,
But heaven holds all for which you sigh . --
We lift our hearts toward the pitying sky --
Justice can lay no blame on blameless shelves ,
There comes a form from days of old ,
The constellations meet , but through benign
Where his people would find shelter .
In manhood must he find his competence ;
Nor with love to cloak disdain ,
The world and nature yield to give him way .
But if tears ever touched , for any grief ,
You fail to understand and find but madness
He wears the wreath no rivalry can dim !
' mong heavy roses weighed with dew
Beyond the sob that stilled erinna 's voice .
And the bargain was made .
That gift of his , from god descended .
That have for years our patience tried --
A richess of those sweets she found ,
Silent , the mighty cliff receives at last
To you he gave his laughter and his jest ,
A stately home echoed to voices sweet ,
Through rencesvals a little river ran ;
With lips yet murmuring low it rolled afar
For he felt it a sort of musical stain
Yet seem to link her with the utmost skies ?
When tudor humbled spain .
There sprang a thicker and a fresher shade .
Members of order , firmly bound .
While wicked hearts are troubled
And onward to the battle sped .
When science plans the progress of their toil !
His name bestrode the seas like death .
By the heaving ocean i sank to sleep .
Stumbled headlong , and cast him face to ground .
Thou faded thing ! can make thee flourish .
Better with breath than i did feel myself ,
I would note that such stanzas as
Round that mountain music floated ,
Such icy kisses , anchorites that live
Exhausted patience , and consumed the hour .
I made him tyrant : gave him power to wrong
At first i caught hold of the wing ,
Nearer the heavy thunder drew ,
Thy lucid waves are flowing ,
Till that me list to draw . ’
I can feel the thrill of the daring jump ,
And sealed in faith within its sacred care , --
To light the skies with english fire .
I saw but care and vice reign there
Debates if it will go .
To show their thankfulness in many a smile .
But pharaoh 's heart was hardened still ,
Wherefore the pleasures pass them by :
Clamoring yet where a faith lay stifled .
The sun makes silence seem a boon ,
Where she would see the buildings where they played
Into the earth -- fulfilling it to form and bear
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given ,
All valiant boys , the lady bore .
And lend to the rhyme of the poet
To feel that they had stars for toys !
How much he held that regiment in price .
To make life happier and more fair
That strife and hatred play some part
John bull for pastime took a prance
But not the wisdom to be led .
No spring within her bosom came to pass .
In blushing loveliness she sought his side .
Shades of those from life departed ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Like the crystal waters flowing .
He set a trap to catch the thief ,
And the red rose would but blow more red ,
To follow where thou leadest , reverend sire ,
And call that hope which is despair ,
A torrid and tortuous tempest stung
And trousers the tailor must press .
A charm , by truth divinely cast ,
There rose the choral hymn of praise ,
And cruel beak to stab and tear
That melts in blushes on the downy cheek .
Now with fierce rage his swelling bosom fires ;
The active virtue , being made a soul
Remembering him whom death had swallowed up ,
And will another tale pursue .
Give warning to the world that i am fled
The delicate shells lay on the shore ;
Actions are brought large damages to gain ,
His worth has known advancement , -- each new height
Whose blood ran mingling in the fount
Toil only gives the soul to shine ,
And every script is wandering forlorn ,
Lay the monster mishe-nahma ,
Making powerless the lightnings of mischance .
And sympathetic sorrow fills my eyes ;
A joy in which affection takes no part ?
We make delay , that somewhat first the sense ,
Dragged it so far , he made of that alone
And shadowy forms with staring eyes stalk round ;
" the escorting spirits turned with gentle looks
I funked the hiding bill could give me .
That something dear to me it seemed to say :
Her fragrant petals , their beauties showing ,
The dinner carried in the small tin pail ,
Hellish vapours rise around !
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears ,
If such a dreamy touch should fall ,
As the pure zone which circles dian 's waist .
They guard all noble things ,
Where healing streamlets run ,
Comes this long wave of summer , bursting white
But , save the interpreter the lesson reads ,
Oft with close steps these happy lovers strayed ,
And nations mix with their primeval dust :
They may furnish some fifty good reasons for doubting
Your spirits bold , so now unfold
Nay every penny i could raise .
Winter was passing ; soon the year would mend .
Thy pride to face the majesty of heaven ?
Forty times over let michaelmas pass ,
The alarum of drums swept past ,
Why wear that veil of drifting mist ?
Above the pushing crowd to her far home ,
Again pure splendour light yon bursting views ,
Frae town to town i draw that .
But when they touched the chariot made
When summer comes again , the turf will lie
Already did the tears begin to rise .
Brighter hours are drawing near .
Who never would give me a moment of rest
“ thundering with mighty clash , with terror struck
A castle stands in yorkshire
Cries that would free my heart 's wild wonderment ;
Who knows what golden story first gave birth
Such fiery havoc . o , the tale declare ;
But breathe revenge , and for the combat burn .
They pass and have left no traces ;
Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes .
And hoping to add thereto a ray
Thou has taken hence one hostess ,
But when the world went wild with spring ,
His manly worth , and share the glorious day ?
But shame in me his menaces produced ,
Though all the weight within them downward bears .
Could i recall every joy that befell me
No circling arms to draw me near --
Above the hills the blushing orb arose ;
In stede of love is hate guided ,
Or ease the brow of grief .
A breeze which , from the starboard blowing light ,
How i 'd smothered a bomb that fell
England , when europe echoed back aloud
To stay thee in thy solitude .
Not that i feel that hunger after fame ,
And o’er that course fate ever reigns .
Saw the same sun go down year after year ;
Of the soft quality fits woman well ,
And shall no time our bondage sever
Aroused , it press and follow mind 's desire ;
That such a misfortune should give her such pain ;
Scarce had grown to the tree .
I make no haste to have my numbers read :
Whom love first touched with others ' woe --
First moved to ire by taunts and stings ,
The grand old sea remembers what hath been .
Mayhap it brings some comfort .
" and virtue gives her heavenly lore ,
Where each old bell its ancient echoes pours .
Fastidious , seeking less familiar scenes .
That bearing children made such a change ;
Each parasite , then , as in duty bound ,
Calls in the country , catches opening glades ,
A sigh or tear can not that boon impart ,
Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood ;
The sun that dropped down our horizon 's verge ,
To spread the breach that words begin ;
To the doubter 's soul appealing ,
And tender herb with pearly moisture bowed .
And courage take when his brave end they read .
With wings of melody that flew abroad
And he spoke the words which follow :
In the new voice of greece are echoed there ;
Now to the low leaves they cling ,
Night with her stars but fitful slumbers brought .
That tells my faults , i hate him mortally :
With passions into ashes turned
But thou didst not bear witness half so true
Yet stars will burn through any mists ,
Hark ! with mirth the skies resound .
The brook whose source i never traced ,
My veins are fired with ecstasy !
That holds their blossoms and their leaves in cure
And give soft transport to a parent 's heart .
To bear the lonely orphan 's struggling part ;
" whose gentle lips persuade without a word ,
Still surging dark against the christian bound
And lets the victual follow in his rear .
Until it mounted heaven-high ;
And flown to meet her kiss . ”
In the summer just passed over ,
Light heard as music , music seen as light .
My hand sought hers as in earnest need ,
Feel the old ague wring them , far removed
The memories of a past that held so much .
What wives and wabsters see and feel .
Through which we 're fashioned to a single state ,
" that prophet ill sustains his holy call ,
Awake , awake , the morn will never rise ,
To find those about him so very polite .
Never to lave its love in them again .
There remained be many summers ,
Do fortune as she list , i stand prepared ,
Drink they gave the bridal party ,
That is , to thy obedience ; therein stand .
Doubt might beget of diabolic pow ' r
Thus hermes spoke ; and as his flight he takes
For daybreak 's prayer is surely borne on high
To follow , nor far off , the gorgeous oak
And spread their guardian terrors round the land ;
I feel thy hot tears sheltering on my face .
When days with petty cares are filled
He leaned one breathing-space ;
The french which found how little henry makes ,
Women as women see them is a gift
What moots it whither mortals turn ?
That her eternal verse employ 'd should be
Left man the only beast to prey on man .
Instant to act , to plunge into the strife ,
She patted all the world ; old empires peeped
Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee ,
Summer had come with its blossoms , and gaily
Shall to-morrow find its place .
Where the gleam of heaven gliding shall come
Rough winter has gone :
And royalty to crack his joke --
That not one joy was left .
And in thine house hast left me desolate ;
Lorenzo ! let me turn my thoughts on thee ,
Thy courage great keeps all our foes in awe ;
Full three days were not sped ,
The limpid water turbidly ran ,
To good or evil as may come ;
Gives added fragrance to the summer flowers ,
While day arises , that sweet hour of prime .
O , the comfort we feel
Made the storms arise in fury ,
They come as a song comes out of the past
Pure , white rose-leaves washed with dew .
Nor turned , nor cast a backward look :
Matter was monarch ; spirit stood apart ,
Here justice holds us prison 'd , hand and foot
That numbs the soul with icy hand ,
Bellowed , and beat the canvas , and my ship
And i hold as law this custom ;
There gently lay the roots , and there
Shot from the shaft a gleam of flame ,
Of such , an index and appendix showed .
To him , the flesh meant silver and gold .
And met the river breezes there ,
Have fought with hatred 's biting lust .
He stayed the game to breathe some words of love
Yet , bathed in gloom too long , we might
Aye , how the ghostly hand will point
Calm as the sea when sleeps the breeze .
As their sun draws nigh or disappears .
When hawick he passed , had curfew rung ,
Of chiefs the furious fiend addressed :
Another path by sweet mistake betrays ,
Give thy strength to serve thy brother
Now morning from her orient chambers came ,
Then they clinched and fell and struggled ,
Destroy 'd by them , has got a fall .
Till on his head th ' avenging plague descends .
And he returns to the theme :
Could you not read in such disparagement
To them he 'll diminish his bill ;
And pleasure made her cheeks grow red ,
The wreck my vanity brought on ! --
Sumantra , ere the word was given ,
You see how our soracte now is standing
Their faults i will discover ;
Onward through life he goes ;
The slumber of his lips meseems to run
If a philosopher that way had come ,
Will from the steadfast way of life be drawn .
With these let _ harmony of parts _ combine .
Fate would not let me follow where he led .
What a world of merriment their melody foretells !
The weary dragon lay ;
“ thy kind indulgence , which a passage gives ,
Whereof have come the marvellous harmonies ,
Will bear me home .
Would guard the pass of right line tyranny .
A nation 's grief the funeral torch attends .
There has always been found a protector or saint .
And which some one in pity must relieve ,
The king his supplication made :
Shall he that feeds his heart full of the day
Have set since he was laid on sleep ,
I talked with horace ; felt his spell ,
Comes the sorrowful wail of the broken of heart ;
Come , chase that starting tear away .
They draw a knot and heave a sigh ,
The soul is dowered with awful things ,
And all the chase rode on .
And run the risk of colliding :
And that ye will a fair decision give .
Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights ,
How love and its sorrows allowed him no sleep .
That winds around the great invisible ;
A dart that laughed at distance and at speed .
Impetuous , from conflicting vapours sprung ,
While tears and sobs her utterance broke ,
Here spread his careless blossoms , here
She at my door till dawn shall stand ,
Till one by one the stains her kisses made
In carnage took no part ;
Even as the new snow covers up the old .
With buds of battles opening fitfully ,
He comes and makes her glad ;
Doubtless i shall take death more sweetly thus .
Now toward the light again it lifts aloft
Her colors display 'd , and with vengeance repaid
The prayer he prompted too ;
Tho ' the flowers have sunk in death ;
And labored long before his work was shown ;
But alexander bore a scar ,
Such false reports did fill all places ,
Filling dim surfaces with golden laughter ,
A little wife he took ;
Gleaming like snow when their wings catch the sunshine ,
Great scott ! do n't you see
Then turned the bridle to resume her way
She seems with joy to swell ,
Silk is the sail they spread in the gale ,
Its pride bowed low . in panic and fright ,
The deadly coil of fate is bound ,
Words that came from distant ages ,
Where saints of all orders their freedom may claim ,
That i the sense may not have fairly tested .
And shown thy resolution to the last
Light as a bubble that flies from the tub ,
Hither the armies went , and chanted shrill ,
When a glug felt extra specially glum ,
His little fair page now follows alone ,
Now i lead a life of ease ,
Why took you then their musters ?
And , gathering on our brows a frown ,
Free let the fleet hind bound her hills along ,
Only send the echo of thy footfalls --
Fate so dread as his hath seen ;
To what base depths apostasy can go ;
An arrow had not reached the flying horse .
Mourn perish 'd hope , or pour remorseful fear ;
That bids the birds rejoice .
Fly away ! and bear our love
Where cold dodona lifts her holy trees ;
What fleets shall follow through the skies .
The funeral came into fair scotland ,
We tread the land that bore us ,
Songs to see , past pitch of sweet .
Save to the faith that reared the little shrine ,
He would not , armed with beauty , only reign
To human nature gave , that its creator
And with embraces _ vilna _ bind .
Now lay those sorrowfull complaints aside ;
I rose with a need for life ,
And it flashes up the slope and sits in splendor
When its mother takes affright ,
The incense will go sighing ,
That duty bade me fall in love ,
Hop and skip to fancy 's fiddle ,
May find a god to love him !
Fly south to bring me tidings true ,
" to meet the spirit of the age ,
Take flight and follow and find the sun .
I see before me the gladiator lie :
How oft we find when sickness brings distress ,
" madness fell on me in my loneliness ,
And put a period to your gladsome days ,
Today the nation 's heart lies crushed and weak ;
If bleak and barren scotia 's hills arise ;
Following on the veiled bride
To use their wakefulness when it returns . "
Planets and suns run lawless through the sky ;
Just as old age is creeping on apace ,
Once more the nations go
Then his father gave him answer :
For truthful lips and passions tamed .
And nostrils red , and crests flying free ;
I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away ,
And smile that never left thy mouth
From my heart i give thee joy , --
And my love came behind me --
Has made thy form and feature strange .
And it makes his heart rejoice .
And , when a hundred years had fled ,
Light with darkness woven above ,
Nor dreamed that faith could fly .
And the wind that runs with rippling shoon --
Hurling away whatever would oppose .
To lie on its holy flowerets fair ,
The radiant moon above us held :
And they say the black clouds gathered , and a
The king alternate a dire tale relates ,
O'er the brow of creation enchantingly thrown ,
There was no sound but long tears following
How near me came the hand of death ,
Of lamentation , like a wind that shrills
Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee ,
She , by love ’s thrilling influence led ,
Take heart , -- uncloud your faces ,
I know how all the muse 's heavenly lays ,
So sad a sigh has brought ? "
Of passion burns downward to blacken and scorch !
Twas he that stopped the strike in coal ,
Spirits felt love 's pangs with pleasure ,
Themselves with such a roof , that can secure
More copious held . greedy of warmth it seeks
Dying , she laps herself for hours and hours
But first cast off thy wonted churlishness .
Auspicious signs of victory came .
Thou hast shattered into ruin ,
My heart turned troubled at the ominous thing :
Things perish . gods have passed .
Man for his palate fits by torturing fires .
And histories to show all secrets of life ?
" the evening sees us bathed in tears .
And merlin locked his hand in hers and said :
But should it come again that men like rhymes
No farther seek his merits to disclose ,
Began to move in lucid music now .
Feed once again this heart with fires that burn ,
Which scarce can you discern from medicine .
Thy peerless chivalry reveal ,
And yielded up the patent of its charm .
The dead whom tears can bring no more ?
But soon a scream made him arise ;
And lilith , roses dipped in wine ,
Or run upon the sharp wind of the north ,
Sounded aloud . the peal it blew had made
The sands of nile where fell the fatal blow .
If pure the motive that such action feeds .
Downward to toil and be mixed with the main .
Ivy that trembled on the spray , and ears ,
Commands the guard , what sentries keep the post .
The victors see the rallying foes unite .
The shelter of the friendly shades to gain .
This judgment we commit : the loser then
His music does not make the heart dilate ,
Came the cholera 's gaunt spectre ,
The same dry , bony fingers nursed .
But take this comfort to thy misery ;
Hope flies before , and the hours slip past :
They chain the hands might wash the stains away .
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;
Hearts , like doors , will ope with ease
Quickly comes the melodious response :
On his pillow from whence the screaming came .
They turn to me in sorrowful thought ;
How the deuce they go :
Near thee take my rest .
As it turned round and saw the eastern skies )
The very clouds that scan the blue of heaven ,
And up to open heaven forthwith was borne ,
And winter 's dying breath comes hard and fast ,
What long array of triumph had he brought !
Gathering her brows like gathering storm ,
Then to the female slaves he gave command
And from the blood the saplings sprang
Out of the earth the poem grows
Whose brain and heart served ever christian need --
Dull november brings the blast ;
Follows the night on her weeping way .
The years shall come and pass , but we
They made his glare , which none might brook ,
Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand ;
Will harvest 's voice above the chorus rang .
As one in slumber held . not long that mood
A chilled or burning heart behind : --
Swift to building work addressed ,
That bound two lives together ?
Some lost love 's eyes are dim before they shine
The blood whose ancient founts in thee are found
Hast seen a cobweb spun across the moon ,
With cares and sorrows worn ;
From which the light of cities came , the power
Comes with his stately stride .
Enkindled , and the one that first had come
Will wear from its pillar the greatest name .
And his long beard descended on his breast .
It crossed the sea and reached the shore ,
We stood by the lake as it lay
Of a terrified child lost to all save alarm ,
Nor moan of loneliness ,
Making new year 's calls .
Is wafted the fragrance they shed .
The waiting grave would welcome as its guest .
Are founded on hope that is strong ;
Song brings us light with the power of lending
When the pond 's terror too must go ;
He then will shed his grace like dew
Farther than soul can reach .
Her laughter hid , and shame was born .
And he was followed by kempions twelve ,
Thus with his warlike soul communion held :
Shall dwindle , shall blend ,
Much more than i relate between us pass 'd :
That to the soldan bore a mighty treasure .
The hero 's , patriot 's image stands ;
When sacrifice absolved our earth .
But knowing , having weighed the opposing risks .
Unwilling daylight steals amidst the gloom ,
't is only ours to stand the test .
The crown it furled a draggled flag ,
And my tears ran wild .
It grunted , as still it stayed .
Wake and climb to find the light .
Are gloomy enow to fit his pain .
Why should it only say the long night through ,
Was caught in mathematics , jotted down
Still to those courts my footsteps turn ,
And the sun hath sunk to rest ,
At length the day of trial comes -- the day
The soul , exhaling , issued at the vent .
The good we 've sought for many a year
I turn mine eyes upon thy hills
They point to their fast swelling ranks overjoyed ;
Catching the sunshine oh , darling , each heart
This is the point i wish to make ; --
Then romance lived and breathed and burned .
The warrior showed ,
Whose voices come to us on the breeze .
What should one do when nature calls !
So swiftly caught in beauty 's shimmering
Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind .
Creative power soon in your breast unfolded ;
Which , gently gleaming , makes a show
But they heaved the billow before the prow ,
Their memories living in her hands
Forsooth the present we must give
Blindfold his servant led to do his will !
An hour had passed : the noonday sun
As set her nerves a-shivering .
What recked the chieftain if he stood
That i the tenour of my creed unfold ;
The vales redoubled to the hills , and they
And sunshine will flash at our call ;
Yet at the last his aimed end he gains .
But give me real , sterling wit ,
-- " laws were made for will ,
But he makes answer with a massy spear ,
The likeness of a nun . i seemed to trace
And another added these truthful words
Glimpses of daylight are going .
Draws a harvest each year from the soil ,
Never doubted clouds would break ,
For having lost but once your prime ,
And crowding thoughts that gender strife .
The supreme essence from which this is drawn .
Resembling , straightway in its place arose .
By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies .
And thus in words his rising wrath expressed .
Enchanting scenes meet everywhere his eyes .
Where trade goes clamoring up and down ,
To his own prowess all the glory gave :
" for this the central caverns gave their gems ;
That fate the gods prepared ; they spin the thread
But a spirit of comfort there held reign ,
Reproach and burning shame .
Who fought for charles when fears were harvested ,
And his low voicing haunt its slipping snows
The morn broke , and found juan slumbering still
Which came a new year 's light to shed ,
For it was seated in a pleasant shade ,
He who struck terror into all the world ;
Whether my bark went down at sea ,
When winter brings its snow and ice ,
In sobs his consort dear to hers gave vent ,
Unheeded there , pale , sunk , aghast ,
Echoes of mourning rolled : the sighing air
And hanumán his speech renewed :
Of bliss the fountain flowing ,
It gave him such pleasure to tease him .
But cheshire men ( as stories say )
That lingers in the garden there .
And he from whom is knowledge hid . "
Almost turned back the prosperous tide of fate .
By intellect and art i here have brought thee ;
He came : his quiver on his shoulders lay ,
The stirring memory of a thousand years ,
May in peace be ushered in . "
Then the young reindeer o'er the hills bounding
A time must arrive when , in pitiful case ,
That hides his murmurs in the rose , --
Each star to numberless planets gives light and
With sounds that like sweet longings wake in him
" long days have passed since i from distant land
To catch the breeze from yonder hill ,
For this fair nymph another boon remains . "
Havoc and devastation they prepare ,
And sprang up to a glorious birth --
Upborne , the palace stood . the lofty roof
The flame that lit the battle 's wreck ,
And frothing fangs , collecting for the spring ,
Spring came again , and the flowers rose
" let yourself slide down among us ,
There lies the meaning and the worth !
Till it faded in my dream .
Feel the force of religion and truth !
The anxious-masted ships that westward fare ,
For virtue will ever obtain her respect ,
That falls upon an infant , wafting it
Our eyes were drawn together , and the hue
To do what they had gladly left undone ,
Raged elsewhere , nor the city streamed with gore .
The trees wore stoles of green ,
Where the snow had drifted ; the subject dropped .
That earth for amorous heaven had set
And thus the important talk pursued .
For morn is approaching your charms to restore ,
Some dream of danger to her young hath stirred .
Of flowers set in comeliness ;
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures ;
One sigh of all the mystery in thee found .
Who on this everlasting basis placed
Sudden chivalries revealing whence the longing is renewed
Youth 's broken lily perished in its prime .
Each sun with the worlds that round him roll ,
The bold tyrant hipparchus extended in gore .
Nor soothes his body nor saves his soul .
To it the heaven shows
The hours that she might spend apart .
For , having caught one glimpse of dawn ,
And not one word has come to cheer my heart
With tears shed for them , and by turns again
Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air ,
At which they all set to , like mad !
To those that came for unsung trust ,
Ye fields , where labor counts his sheaves ,
But the shadow drew anear them ,
The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
Had made impression in the people 's hearts ,
Or ran the chromatic scale up :
And blood in sable streams ran from his mouth .
That never a wind may reach ,
The solid forest gives fluid utterances ,
As shallow streams run dimpling all the way .
Where the seal of the years was set , --
No snow unto that limit doth attain .
The lovesick nymph revived .
The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine
And in her wide imagination stood
And cast her on the dark , unfeeling mold ;
Here dies its loud and mourning strife ,
They reappeared , the elder joined the sports
The bondage which has held in icy chains
How will they fare in a world so bleak ?
Or not to take a jump into the fire ?
A rain of fragrant flowers was shed .
To him shall knowledge and sight be given . "
Let the dream go . are there not other dreams
While the wheel goes round and round ,
He lived where dreams were sown .
And truths divine came mended from that tongue .
As winds come lightly whispering from the west ,
Can herald their degree .
The walls of paris , arms together bore .
I see it running , while the clover-stalks
So that the blood made horrible his face ,
And softly sheds her silver light
His drains made water-wheels spin round ,
I have made my choice , have lived my
In joy or sorrow felt a glowing flame .
And keenly felt the friendly glow ,
And draws the curtains , fanning still more bright
My pain i could not feel .
And silence filled the air --
And up in a cloud the good smoke goes ,
Because i fain had given them greater wits :
My vacant thoughts , and giving hope fresh life ,
Some star had pierced my darkness with its ray --
A moment ’s glory ; and what fates attend !
Take care of thyself ,
To ride a whim beyond the term of truth ,
The last judgment-day was coming .
His ghostly sway maintained .
An evil race , by pity never swayed ,
That moving moves the nest and nestling , sway 'd
The laugh that followed had not died away
All borrowed sorrow :
Above the arrow 's flight , to train the falcon
Than to avoid the title of his friend .
The wonder that had come into her face .
Then took he joy of her , and little guessed
And felt the wings of immortality ;
To take a trip upon the ocean .
Bled , pierced with anguish insupportable .
Answered in the words which follow :
Long enough to feel its conscious calm assault :
Find peace or hope -- forever
The self same fame they equally did feel ,
Cold northern natures borne , perhaps ,
The moon slips from a silver mist , --
The lion made a sudden stop ,
It comes forth from loving hearts ;
Made fruitless efforts to restore me ,
From the huge platters charged with juicy meat ;
Ah me ! how quick the days are flitting !
Observe how system into system runs ,
Makes me powerful over others . "
Of christ , therefore as organized and made
My heart would break for joy to welcome him :
By faith alone our march we kept .
Orlando from his hand in fury threw .
And in each house made desolate
How the voyage passed , i know not ;
Pushing her bonnet forward till it twined
That makes for her the happiest doom .
And makes him wish that he could back recall ,
Feeling her cool lips quench my own .
Why , pretty soon i fall asleep ;
The single reign of law that binds them all .
When mingled thus they cease to shine ,
By crossing terrors wildly tossed ,
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here ! --
And peace is hopeless , let the war proceed .
Christmas songs at times have tried .
Onward through life he goes ;
That brings us nearer the celestial gate .
Cast his weather eye to leeward ,
Man 's grave reasons disappear !
The gall that envy 's tongue can shed .
Brown martial brows in dying throes have wanned
Ringed by a circle of furnace and fiend !
A letter is brought whose lines disclose
Would her roseate path pursue .
His eyes with reverence meet , and praised
To play through life a perfect part ,
The winter rose must blow , the sun put on
To encounter king and people 's common hate ;
Always the same my work must go ;
Quenched the fierce fever 's heat , defeated death ;
The comyn belle made he rynge .
Of discord here full riot ran ,
We never laid a scheme to be wealthy ,
Of lofty solace lay in every star ,
The slippery sides , and shoot into the skies .
And barren smiles are trained for tragedy ;
Since michael and his powers went forth to tame
That at each other hurled their books of prayer .
Lord marmion gave attention cold ,
Joyous and free , gone all his sadness ,
A century has passed since at thy knee
I never was attached to that great sect
Religion , taking every mortal form
By wild typhoon , or swept by frost ,
God gave that sweet sad smile she wore
A brighter beam of glory glanced :
Changed hope and fear till fear took flight ,
Behold how all things are made true !
There might still misfortune find thee ,
Though faction 's scorn at first did shun
She made her face a darkness from the king ;
Where rests the one god-given right
Is a mark of beauty , as beauty goes ;
Give god the praise !
The joy of those old memories he feels :
Of perfume shall fling up into the air ,
To change ; her elfin blood in madness ran ,
Cold sweat and shivering ran o'er every limb ,
Your life has grown apace and blossomed ,
By the frosty air led hither ,
The great white clouds sail onward
Such angry passions rise ;
In women , i will look for youth ,
Pass one by one across her dreaming years ,
There comes to peasants and to kings ,
See the gay bannerets flying ,
Let the willow drive them homeward ,
From dark to daybreak made the silence cry ;
The household priest went first in place ,
The flowers advance to make the world so gay .
Strength doth feebleness appear ;
And that 's what makes him walk zigzag .
And gave the knight great thanks in little speech ,
The giant forest rises to the sky .
Swore it should forever wave --
Bring my story to an end .
Across the sounds and channels pour ;
That gives itself to follow shows of sense
With sovereign art had fashioned each pilaster .
You freed from bondage and from vile oppression
My heart a heaven , opening like a flower ,
But who hath breathed the scent of violets ,
And trails the last cloud into lifeless haze .
Let others give you wealth and love ,
Of old forests echoing round ,
Man 's love follows many faces ,
Some timid spirit faith would courage give ;
Their music fills the dreamy hills ,
Human hearts are tossed and drifted
And in grim silence gnaws the festering wound ;
His mind held opulence -- his speech the rare
And eyes like blazing coals of fire .
Then it would run like a steady stream
The stealthy peril stalking us , she stood there .
Let every wise man make a use of his reason
That luxury could offer was his own .
The tear of sorrow from him flew ,
Whose purity the waves recall
To make smooth the path of lovers ,
Who dream and keep under smiles the grief thereof ,
And the round year with daily labour fills :
From the towers that show the cross ,
The fell embrace of slavery 's sphere of sin ,
Burn 'd inward ; all his vitals felt the flame
Because fate holds no prize to crown success ;
Thy lips are trembling with a song of france ,
Awaking find the vision true .
Proud commerce lives upon thy sweeping tide
Should praise his god for mercies given ,
" of light and darkness may combine .
" in which the charm of country lies
And then came peace , and gentle beauty came ,
On the cross-tree that bore it .
Beyond the grave , there stood his secret thought .
Hope and beauty and joy that build
The red and yellow roses pricked his eyelids ,
Let her take a jolly pleaseman ;
Sings , and makes oath a churl is he
Love arose and went with me
Should join our hands to pray to thee ?
Many inquiries have been made respecting the elementary monarchs
These are the days when skies put on
To the principal precept inclined ;
Of that last judgment , and last day drawn near
And years of biting frost and washing rain ,
Think you i find no beauty there ,
Roads and pathways reach to it .
Watching that no wild beast may scatter it ,
And find that half a century has gone by ,
Of murmuring surges breaking on the shore ;
By her alarm 'd , he sees impending fate ,
When my soul broke its silence , flushed
Foretold so lately what would come to pass ,
Leap down to different seas , and as they roll
And wash away all memory
As unbelief before , shakes us by fits ,
To thy bosom lay my heart ,
The sun those mornings used to find ,
The trumpet call it , or to endless pain ,
When richardetto she beheld , made show
The evil days have come , the poor
In love-sick languor hung her head ,
' and darkness and doubt are now flying away ;
Pure uniformity is gently born
The moon hangs o'er the wooded height ;
Beneath the green paws finds itself again ;
Brings forth its races , but does not restore ,
Tear off the trojan mothers as they clasp
By his side i courted slumber ,
Lay the proud usurpers low !
To save from ignorance and vice
O may no son the father 's honour stain ,
Whose hand directs , whose spirit fills and warms
A wed to me shall he lay . ’
And all his fortune hang upon the throw .
It came slowly to the surface
Where trojan kingdoms once again may rise ,
So stood the lord whose sign you are ,
But soon that cloud shall hide its light ,
His hindward charms gleam an unearthly white .
The herald of her triumph , drawing nigh
O'er waving autumn bend your airy ring ,
" there flows through all her perfect frame
But wary makes the persons after him ,
And wealth has filled his halls with mirth ,
And duty ’s claim is satisfied .
Sank to slow unconsciousness . . .
While the world goes round .
Yet nought but single darkness do i find .
What should we doubt of the years that roll ?
The touch of him would send her in a queer
I give their horses exercise ;
Clovis retreats -- his men returned no blow ;
With sadness locked . to muffled ears
Ofttimes in arcs of transient beauty hung
New statutes rise , and stronger laws succeed ;
My anger would heavily fall there 's no doubt .
Hast given a crown to monarchy .
Home from her convent to the palace came
Go sleep , and so beguile thy mind !
Of young romance , and weaves a dream
Some tell me moving tales of love and passion ,
" the charm is broken ! -- once betrayed ,
Whose every spear flies , instant , to the mark
Secure , that death will set them loose . '
Fear of silence made them strive
Hated rival -- scorn i bear thee
That bore victory to him ,
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds ;
Strew all the field , and verdant tender grass
In love of nature such will surely find ,
To miriam 's note of triumph sent
Their hearts remain small drawn .
Take not the rights of human kind away .
But in thy sight our off ' ring stands --
And still when time had turned him gray ,
She 's rich who has to spare :
The water 's melody pursued ,
Made him captive to her singing and her smiles .
That flew on so rapidly , sweet with content ?
Where summer has passed with her gorgeous train ;
Heart-stricken , gave his tears to flow ,
His woven world drops back ; and he ,
The sun stood dark at noon ;
Which brought us here from lands afar ,
And the hope that says " adieu , "
When , his pulse failing , passion speechless lies ,
Custom or fashion ne'er refuses ;
Locking the ranks as they form and form ,
On angad too the blow will fall
Strange peoples swarmed ; new nations sprang to birth .
The signet ring young lewis took ,
( war has swept the countryside of the songs it
In heavy sleep with cares oppressed ;
The spring had showered thick with dew . --
In bearing down , impelled by winds that blow
Eternal love , maintain thy life in me !
In which the times are seen reflected .
Her voice spoke of sorrow ,
But came the waves and washed it away :
The village preacher 's modest mansion rose .
The hands that cling and the feet that follow ,
And sea with storms he overhung , and night
Oblivion closes round her darken 'd mind ;
Out of my chanting arose ,
Like garlic , howsoever she extends
They would perceive what pardons they confide in ,
A joyful train , the wedded lovers pour :
Write dull receipts how poems may be made ;
Would take it by turns and milk her dry !
The blue curled eddies of the blowing rhine ,
Whence issued forth the blood by judas sold ,
Not trees and rocks , but provinces it leads .
And so allowes what it denies .
And smile when evening falls .
And to sweet pastures led ,
Withered flowers , trampled deep
Blood could not ease the bitter lust
But oh ! when midnight came , again
All day the birches bend to hear
And the wild fire makes shimmer of blood
And flashing between those simple words , he saw
Dear , foolish fragments made me strong again ;
Scarcely one little red rose springing
With grace your spirits fill ,
Let it flow a stream like honey ,
O'er the bright fountain bends the fearless deer ;
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell ,
So that i do approve what forth emerged ;
They had gone forth to win far citizens ,
Their journey after bharat made ;
Large tears that leave the lashes bright !
With sweet rhymes ringing through his head ,
Where a great river fills the wild ;
Where the broad ocean leans against the land ,
And by all means for his deliverance meet ,
Your eyes drink of me ,
But vile concoctions to make dull heads ache ?
Amende the or thy youth be fully gone
Far as wide earth 's remotest boundary lies ,
And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway
To ease the victim no device can save ,
Drink life and fragrance as they flow .
Where the immortal dead have sate ,
See the third is nearly gone :
With his songs he lay extended ,
Shall you search for new adventures ;
My will is lost in the will divine ,
Still beating as the low live throb of blood ,
To some enchanted castle is convey 'd ,
Of ardent temper , quick and flashing zeal ,
But o , my heart thus sporting with desire ,
And the wavering shadows fade along the snow .
" we lift the weight of flatling years ;
Which noted token of the woodland war
And stars that shoot through freezing air at even -
The name is apt to express the essence ,
To watch the wild waves flutter and beat
Volumes of smoke which joined one cloud to make .
From sultry raiment shaking scents of musk ,
The lips of the second will give as sweet kisses
Of words and music caught from glen and height ,
Six hundred and thirty souls held she ,
It comes to this , dear robert burns ,
Of christ 's true faith there lies the champion bold
Scatter the salted corn , and place the bays ,
Beyond the circle where the glory beats
Talk not of love , it gives me pain ,
Sudden , a dazzling glory lit the wood --
He raised his voice : the hills , the shore
Where nought is visible can make appear
The purple blossoms breathe delight ,
Sickened with grief her lips dare not express .
That bliss which only centres in the mind :
Made silence aweful by their sudden pause .
And every time he reached _ amen _ ,
Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed
Winter is passing . the inconstant sun --
If it will soothe my charmer 's sorrow ,
The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky ,
Through every trembling fibre stirred .
Shall yield the purest joy .
When delicate thought fell from the dreamy moon :
Impetuous , from conflicting vapours sprung ,
Heroic strength that stood alone ,
All our own fates thy shrine reveals to us ;
Her rosial colour comes and goes
In the blood which heroes gave it ;
Lo ! i am worn and weary ,
Their darkness put a glory on !
The praise of spotless truth to thee allow ,
And high ideals fired that infant mind .
This deed hath been perform 'd ; for when myself
For eastward breathes the steady gale
Shall crime bring crime forever ,
And the dead nations never rise again .
Behind , the new embankment rose up black .
" the zephyr to the rose should keep ,
Or cuifs of later times wha held the notion
The wave ascending into smoke ;
His lifted shield that rose and strove
Came a shadow up the hill , --
Spake to her the words that follow :
The rolling periods , as the vision spoke .
Answered in the words which follow :
That quenched and hardened them , and now they stand
In all this ringing through the day ,
My wither 'd heart fills fu '
Disordered , through her currents dash ,
An orient beam which pierced it through
Then ráma , stirred with joy anew ,
“ ah ! what counsel can i give
She heaved a sigh , and wiped her eye ,
Divine what metals in their beauty burned ,
The may unpacks its lovely blossom ,
Every summer came the foemen ,
When the smoke of the cooking hung gray :
They , bent , would fall in prayer .
To death 's dark caverns flowing still ,
It made him whistle , it made him sing ;
Sweet is the breath of morn , her rising sweet
Made use of these strange words to brown .
That sets you spinning through your pretty teens .
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
Our sins to bear .
Limbs of men to give him power ;
To draw enraptured praise from lovers bold !
Were my freezing feet , by frost bound tight
And sparks that unknot the flesh ,
But one tree keeps its goodness all the year .
To fame arise ! for what more fame can yield
Or shall reach when his eyes have been closed .
Its freshness and coolness thou equally shared ’ st ;
Soul filled like thy long veins with sweetness tense ,
In action , yet may make amends in praise .
And as hollowly howling it swept through the sky ,
Turns , and forth stretches eager for the food ,
And a hundred nets he wove him ,
The way his soul shall go .
One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days .
Shine with beauty , breathe of love , --
It makes our very hearts to burn
Feel the large freedom which in faith is given ,
What love that face will bring .
And trembling met this dreadful son of war .
On one another ; pity ceased to melt
In the marriage-train coming on ,
For night and day the ceaseless tempest blew .
Great agamemnon bore a kindly mind :
Such burial the illustrious hector found .
And set free my spirit 's wings .
And when their breath plays with thy bright hair so
The northern foes have trod us down ,
It droops for meditation proud
_ because no clouds went , drifting by , _
Flowers opened earliest ; but when winter came ,
Feel that on me no blame can lie ,
As thick as stars set overhead .
Age glows when young memories appear ;
She someway feels she would like to fling
And yet i find no words to tell
So great the faults it stands encumbered with .
Or pour their plaintive ditties to the wave ,
Now every bullet brought a different wound ;
A lie is little to give ;
But over it all a pleasure went
But when did kindness fail to find
Would i had wings that i might follow you !
And lick the dust before prosperity ,
I gave my songs to the rest ,
When from the window poured pale light .
Give honour to the sainted band .
From her bench the witch made answer :
His white teeth flashing through his russet beard ,
She knows omnipotence has heard her prayer ,
To ease the victim no device can save ,
Upon their own heads crushing ruin and woe .
Where the summer brings its sunshine ,
So level lay the balance of the fight .
Thou ' st gone too far . retreat to serve
And in the cloud that lingered low --
The flowers are weeping for sorrow ,
It took its way ; what sunsets red
To lead sweet lives in purest chastity ,
For she discerned not yet its doom , nor knew
To guide the raft along her course , and round
As with his honor stands and with our need .
More he attempts , but rage permits no more .
Of the brightest hue , while it lingered here .
Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe .
First the charm 'd mind mechanic powers collects ,
Minerva 's form displaying . every nymph ,
" whether thy love loves thee or no ,
That rings thy scant intelligence . "
Th ' enormous faith of many made for one ;
Stands up and takes the morning : but in front
Are blurred with drowsiness .
Are the ploughman 's labours seen ;
There would my spirit follow thee , sweet bird ,
A burning tear there stole .
Together we shall make the last grand charge
It may escape the courtly sparks ,
As now -- and the fields lay thinned .
Than hath been reached except in dreams or death .
The past is also stored in thee ,
Shall follow earth 's december .
The beckoning of a father 's hand we follow --
The shy snowdrops brought
Or june made ready for the sun .
His death unwelcome tidings brings .
And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan .
Than life , cast out all fear .
The king , which understod here wille
To where the daring answer came ,
Their forces trusted with a foreign hand .
Unhappy land , whose blessings tempt the sword ,
To set her name in measur 'd style ;
Whereunto strives the force of human science .
The feet that travelled for our need ,
When bharat holds the royal seat .
A shadow , woven in the hangings , hid
And this is what their music said :
The lie that lurks behind the seeming truth ;
The shamrock waved whare glory led ,
The vessel ran ; she took the happy land
Where he might form his fragrant bowers ,
That leads us to thy fairy shrine .
Swift met the fronts of conflict : all the tribes
Trust him to the hand that made him .
A trojan triumph ; to his lord he brought
" be good . the voices say :
Of aventine spread oft a lake of blood .
A moment he stood balancing with emotion ,
The glorious flood went rolling by
How have they reached on foot this place ?
To stem the deluges of war ,
There warlike arms and mail they laid ,
With scornful laughter buffeted her ears :
The event will quickly show .
Imagines this triumphant strength may bear
The sun rose right above , and fell
Kaikeyí ’s heart with joy beat high .
It curled not tweed alone , that breeze ,
Possess 'd in hatred , lost in blood !
How caught the spanish chieftain at the words !
Scarce felt she that she bled when battle scored
Who left a work long to resist the years .
But pope took up his parable , and knit
Till death , and dropped
The wind is up , and drives the rain ;
Why does the dolphin change its hues ,
The door that admits good news and bad news ,
As master-craftsman his choice tools doth tend ,
But faith can twine round the hoary head
Like those short sweets , ere knit together .
Fortune to lewis a fair face shall show ,
And the cold stars , as if it took delight
Voice after voice caught up the song ,
How many bitter tears he 'll shed !
Before our quest for nothing came to pass . "
And silence settled , wide and still ,
The looking-glasses got about ,
Love 's foes shall give way !
That counts your beauties only by your stains ,
Whene'er a noble deed is wrought ,
The deathless embers fought the creeping gloom .
And placed him on his native hills again ,
Then knit , and passed
As come the white sails of ships
Not yet , not yet ! the season sings
His heart with kindness it o'er ran ,
And will break the sledge to splinters ,
And when the mourning wail rose on the air ,
A collar of gold , set with aquamarines ,
May vile abuse , through you , impart --
The bridal cortege passed .
And drums rattling like curses in red roaring mouths ...
I made six days a hiding-place
And straight the vision fled . a female next
Where armies lie encamped , come flying , lured
It bursts on thy devoted towers ;
Yet , as the wheel flies round ,
Love is augmented , to perfection grows ,
A bear his right arm caught with such sharp fangs
But when thou pours thy strong heart 's blood ,
And their most righteous customs made me scorn
Had hid the place where it did lie .
The little boy lost in the lonely fen ,
Upon the book of verse i gave ,
In a rapturous clime , that lies
The dark fields wait to take the harvest in .
And shun no end which these have brought ;
The tear will tell when hearts are fu ' ,
And over ruined fields the storm hath come . "
Where tangled flowers and clustering trailers spread
Adverse to these shall then in glory come ,
Till he between two bridges laid him dead .
And let the sparks snap with delight ,
Which gave me lessons in the art of song .
When winter comes it brings no gloom
O'er time 's mighty billows borne ,
But down the radiant fillet ran along ,
And where i beauty sought , discordant sights obscene .
To bless the turf that wraps their clay ;
In ruin laid , allow my tears to flow ;
Against god 's pleasure , than that fruit which makes
Mixed to weave its canopy .
By his magic art he made it ,
To kindle with new thoughts degenerate nations ,
In my brain has fixed the notion
And will their courses surely run for ay .
Makes her an idol , and her praises sings
And through that glory sees new worlds foreshown ,
Are but the doors of daring , set
And if you 'll blow to me a kiss ,
The compliments paid to the nymph of the well .
High overhead the great sun hung ,
And through the wound the rushing entrails broke :
A clear bourne floweth , with grasses trailing ,
The virgin soul its god shall see : --
And stretch of tether twenty years to come .
My soul to meet such holy , high demand
Gleaming lilies bathed in moonlight
And he 'll pass outspent as his father went
Than time hath given him chance to do
The silent thoughts of odin which can never change .
Of your deliverance that has not come ,
To bless the turf that wraps their clay ;
The lord himself his attributes shall take ;
How dearly , words want power to show ;
The babe lies yet in smiling infancy ,
Their wan pathetic forms they lay ,
And if their pathway were not thus inflected ,
She heard her lover 's hasty footsteps pass .
So left me to muse on her graces ,
The hissing arrows make the heavens blear ,
The armies fade , the lustre dies .
The triumph to yon realms he shows , --
Before latona made her nest therein
And filled the room with light , and made
And bury such in the mad heaps they raise .
Experience , which can make the foolish wise ,
The brazen door of hell move on its hinges ,
Can scarce his tainted purity restore .
Mankind was made . then fear not this tormentor
Of manhood who deal gently with me here ;
The river rushes on its new-made way ,
The blow a glove gives is but weak :
Not when it tangled up in hopelessness ;
From which old fires have broken , men may fear
So far at once the neighing horses bound .
Alone , the fealty that presents
Last breath was spent in that farewell .
E'er close its issues against pity 's cry ,
Half sunk beneath the horizon ,
Take its meaning to heart :
With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim .
And join the friendly strife , man .
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking ,
Has set my head to aching . i must go
By love made little and by woman shorn ,
So happy death should join what life doth sever ,
This game hym thought full gode ;
His thrust hits hard the leather of the shield ,
Nor ev 'n one glance of comfort threw .
New statutes rise , and stronger laws succeed ;
Their flag to april 's breeze unfurled ,
Rose up with meaning in her eyes . you see
My shroud of white , stuck all with yew ,
Unions deriving from the primal germs .
To burning grief a senseless prey ,
My soul can only give .
Shot through its beautiful heart with black terror ,
Oh lady for whose sake the song was made ,
Again has come the springtime
Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe
And , torn with pangs that pierced him through
Voices that fall incessant , like the rain
There they lay in wait for kwasind ,
Into my heart the sunshine daily bring , dear ;
But soon adown the dying sunset sailing ,
Learn 'd things , that to his victory gave rise
“ now in the shape at present i assume ;
Sounded aloud . the peal it blew had made
And favouring breezes followed on the ships ,
Like troops preparing for their foes ,
To guard against the sorrows hidden in the
And dusky night puts on the garb of morn ,
Shall break again -- most wondrous thought ! --
Leads tangled from a lonely lane
Therefore our grateful hearts go forth to thee ,
I can perceive worth in thee equal to theirs !
The scrolls together , made a sudden turn
" those last miles put them all to bed .
The war-denouncing trumpet took ,
That mingles joy and sorrow , sets down clear
Such noise as i can make to be heard farthest
No sword will summon death , and he will stay
That come unbidden through the bolted door , --
" see that the messenger takes some refreshment .
Thus she bore the whole soul of the gospel
He held communion
The immortals ' anger wrought . but in their ships
Swift tongues of dusk that spoil the sun
The more good earthly vigour it possesses .
The sickening heart can stay ?
Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me ,
And the questions that sow not nor spin ,
The barbs of anger planted , pleased to view
Rich blessings now shall heaven send !
Make haste and get your costes in ,
There came to his ears the sound of a bell
Rembrandt , sad hospital that a murmuring fills ,
And the north-east wind blew fiercely .
Our present safety , and life held in fear ,
A little meat best fits a little belly ,
And give to fame what we to nature owe ;
To settle disputes , in a fury
Ireland danes raiding erin trouble brought ;
Down every wind that passes ,
His rays resistance met . i turn 'd aside
And dryden 's lay made haunted ground to me ,
Of meditation slipping in between
Midst shouts , tumultuous welcomes , kisses showered
A way by love that wakened love within ,
Assail it , but those talons hold in dread ,
It led me to the port of peace .
Early at evening did it burn and late ,
She gathers a repertory of facts ,
Of anguish branded by a world of sin ,
Where ferns were dipping their finger-tips ,
Ther schal no castell ben assailed ;
Which lies between romagna and the realm
Mock not our lost hope lying dead .
Greater than our strength can bear ,
Farewell , river that made life green ,
And softly falls the dew .
Peace he strives to find ;
" onaway ! my heart sings to thee ,
That florence gave the renaissance to rome .
I found strict morals in age and youth ,
And from hill top they caught a gleam
That looks upon the live world ’s light
The bravest band make cheer to me ,
Who that hath felt it shall ever forget
Or can we shake aside this heavy cloud
Gleaming over the field shot forth the ominous lightning .
When young hearts weep as they go to sleep ,
To find , alas ! that days are years ,
Almost that passage had made morning there
When the autumn days shall come ? "
And bonds of hemp and bark were cast
Our hearts still whispering , thou art near !
From nature and man 's passions still are made .
't is not enough no harshness gives offence ,
Of all the heroic ages that are gone ;
To urge the narrow soul to darksome deeds
For the long-faded glories they cover .
Sunlight lay on everything ,
The beaten holes the ratten makes ,
And a feebler faith thy need might serve ;
Have wafted these heroes to victory 's shore --
Came the wild macgregor 's clan-call ,
Ring forth her rapturous hour .
Life seems like a farce scarcely worth sitting through .
Yours be the praise to make my title good ;
Brethren , take the kiss of love !
Hoped-for , till memory dies .
Till , following , i see , --
Are downward cast , and filled with unshed tears .
Bring home the triumph of our victory ;
And all her presence gave such grace ,
" i hear my soul drop down into decay ,
That fed the baptist in the wilderness ;
A flood of thoughts came o'er me
Can surely peace and happiness buy .
Then follows cleopatra , lustful queen . "
And songs of chirping birds invite to rise .
Send up the thrilling murmur , no !
Life and youth will shine again !
Canada should be addressed to the william andrews clark memorial
As far receding as the tomb extends ,
Of huge anticipation gripped all hearts ,
Revengeful cares , and sullen sorrows dwell ,
Scant pity you well may spare ,
Roared the winds and lashed the waters
It could not hold a sigh , --
Around her neck a garland lay
With orient colors waving : with them rose
The seasons came , the seasons passed ,
That the first wearer went to woeful death
Men of this passing age ! -- whose noble deeds
What makes that ship drive on so fast ?
Which for ever came around him ,
While others ' words receive no palm from fame ,
My soul its wish and longing will declare .
Died , and eternal silence stood within .
To all sides stretches infinite and free ,
Let softer cares the present hour employ ,
Sleep came , and coming found the dew of tears
But who recalls the tears she shed ,
But keeps on fighting till he 's counted out .
She shall make poetry on you ! "
To make a day for me .
That makes you want to stare .
From the east dispatch a cloudlet ,
The cock sang merrily ;
The milder swan here spreads his silver wings .
The mien of youth we used to see ,
So , when this state of things i found ,
Burn the glorious names of poets ,
What madness drives you to lust 's dreadful bed ?
Wake , for your hope draws near !
That he might undetected make some prize ;
Their voices told they gave me welcome warm ,
It sang the gift that comes from god
And left his locks to grow .
Her arm made mockery of the warrior 's ramp ;
And freezing winds tumultuous swept the cell ,
Resting not , beating down all the old traces ,
How all the fields resounded with his fame .
To blast the loveliness of all around ,
That scorns a good which is not heaven ;
The gate , and iron arch above it , stands
Scarcely it felt the closing waves that buoy 'd
Where my books i may place ,
Dark carmencita , you passed gay ,
Atones not for that envy which it brings .
There , sunk in sleep , an amorous maid
Make haste , brothers and sisters , push
New parts , or readjust the order given ,
And where'er my footsteps wander ,
But left a void and aching smart ,
At first her eyes are filled with unshed tears ,
Where the bay spread out most widely .
There with illustrious bards i spent my days
Just where every egg should go !
May the religion of the mountain feel ,
To fill the measure of my large estate ;
Alone has saved and yet will save me .
Hector had laid his hand ; around that ship
As bursts the sun through scattering clouds ,
Bring back the tender thoughts of life ,
Forth from my heart , through anguish , broke ;
I have seen many faces changed by the sculptor death
The ruined hope , the friend unkind ,
And quiet in its giving , as though love ,
E’en as thy heart considers meet ,
With notions all at random caught ,
And with a gesture that he held most dear
Each frailty wisely to each rank applied .
Which adds new glory to the shining sphere !
To spend the night wi ' mirth and glee ,
A sound came from the land ;
Priests in white garments go , with sacred wands
Thy crime alone , and leave the rest unknown ?
The eyes that loved not allah saw you not ,
Allowed to truth made visible in man .
And all the murmuring breezes sunk to sleep .
Whereon my weary life is fed :
Of pleasures gone and sorrows come --
His loving heart with rapture swelled :
Shade after shade is passing now ,
That saw the red cross fall ;
His hopes have triumph 'd o'er the past ;
When comes the summer ,
And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage ,
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
His loves that held him in their vital clutch --
Was echoed by his plighted word ,
None on earth she set above me ;
Red lips that made lute harmony ;
And forward went the champions three on foot ,
And your dreamy thoughts are surging
Each vertue for a part came in .
The wife can find no refuge , none ,
That gave me gains , nor hurt my pride .
Thither will i my journey make :
Whose virtue to himself the warrior brought .
The hermit ’s son my thought perceived ;
Where many an author all his fame has found ,
As the alarmed heart leads in the breast ,
Oft when the priests began to raise
And stroked my face . i fell asleep .
Of the zephyrs round me fanned ' : --
And in many quarrels sought them ,
It barks at the sunset sky .
Fainting , yet with hope sustained ,
Take advantage of the circumstance
For oh , to hear the mad guns go ,
That tells me you will not disgrace }
No host , my king with banners spread .
Peace says -- bless you -- men are brothers ,
Of a great ship that steered into the stars ,
In charity set free ,
One who believes as tindal leads the way ,
Excelling all that ever went before :
And they across the river make their way ,
What force of thought and reason can supply ;
Cured , she made this oath :
But know -- by me unerring fates disclose
My stomach having come to me ,
Through all its scale the horrible discord ran ,
Whilst fruitful crops rise by their barren side ,
A time when thought may use unfettered wings .
Such ample breadth ulysses gave the raft .
Crackling flare the streets : from the lone steeple
A lake of sunshine lies ,
There was a road ran past our house
When the stars threw down their spears ,
As quick a growth to meet decay ,
Lest it should make him discontented
That dies away in dimples
But hearts were made for loving --
The shadow further moved ; with silent steps
Fill up the ranks that have opened for you !
How often have my sighs declared my anguish ,
Against his soul struck solemn notes of pain .
Till the sun dropped from the heaven ,
Of goodness , in thus leaving them a voice
Cramp 'd in the formal chains it had embraced ,
It can not go to heaven ,
Of beautiful waves which no storm hath stirred .
Or suffering spirits urge their plea ,
And tropic trees cast shade on every hand ,
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
And ponder what it means .
A man like many another you see .
Abundantly his gifts hath also pour 'd ,
Would give a hearty welcome to his house ,
Cold settles on the painted duck and drake ,
And burden of his state to bear ,
Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth .
Our strength of flight resolved to try .
A whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side
Till months unmeasured came and ran
And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet .
To take me orders while i act the boss ;
The hillside vines dear memories of thee bring :
They no more shall strike for freedom ,
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep ,
Where the sea-winds sing and the sunlight smiles
The dawn that brought no hope nor energy ,
Black , dragon branches whipped below a moon !
Mingle with the tears we shed . -- chorus .
Beyond the margin of this life she saw
But with mocking eyes she carried
More truth than here you 'll find ;
To give to greece the long divided day ?
Oft with thy bosom bare art found ,
Rich consolation he at all times shared .
He looks at as merely ideas ; in short ,
Beauty forever dares to widen and retrace
That her fury-throat might swallow
On the sombre rafters , that round him made
My heart had leapt at that sweet lay ;
Her fervent body leapt or lay ,
And an inferior servant might possibly give satisfaction ,
Towards heaven the flames and sparkles sprang ;
Away went the braves , without question or pause ,
He chuckled silently . the moon came , sweeping
Thus on each part the sinners stood , but soon
A country squire , by whim directed ,
And froze the genial current of the soul .
Of the indentures they have left to mark
That binds the brave of all the earth --
Then counsel took together the general to mislead ,
Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge .
The tired mill turning , turning till it dies .
Fierce to the field of death the hero flies ;
What time the pea puts on the bloom
One prayer -- thrice heavenward drifted --
Some flowers they only shed their bloom
A true-love ballad , lightly rode away .
The burden of his soul he showed .
With a great city lying in its smoke ,
They knew the love i bore thee great , --
The wain bound east , the hearse bound west ,
Here lay his stubborn bow , and quiver fill 'd
The shameful life your words suggest .
That is each round shows more divinity ,
With religion , you might see
Deep and immortal , and it would not feed
Fair shows hide foul deceit .
Measuring out the moments that remained .
Carried the dream of buds that blow .
Which in the very thought renews the fear .
Which for pure sorrow quite had turned my head ,
Then followed servants to be fed ,
Stands the revelation of his love .
Her conscious tail her joy declared :
The beet and carrot want to rise .
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high .
Know you the light that their soul is pursuing ?
She feels as if to youth restored ,
From the brittle mould they borrow .
The blissful thoughts itself had given .
And the ablution cast into the sea .
To join the music of the angel choir !
But wisest fate says no ,
Thus , cold and heat their warring empires hold ,
The present with a heart that looks beyond ,
Issued the sibilant rattle of serpent tongues ;
It finds the foxes so replete with fraud ,
Down swept the lord of allemain ,
And where the limitless horizons hide
Which makes one drunk at once , without the base
Each in the other seeks and finds repose .
It echoes round the exile 's fate --
They wrench not loose , but his allegiance prove .
And still the sweet spring-beauty lies
My naked soul shall come , seared with the stain
Give these vapor-baths new virtues ,
The grief my heart was striving to forget .
She gave a sign that thou wouldst know ,
The past came back , -- a tangled thread .
They drew the magic ring round those who loved ,
Here we go upon the tide ,
As the circus comes , --
Next came donkey races and pony likewise ,
That things are carried on and made complete ,
And fill the earth with song .
But this fair hall to truth and freedom given ,
Four hours of absence make four centuries !
The fairy added beside , --
And the notes of pleasure follow .
Then bursting in a tempest terrible
The frozen eyeballs stared upon a wilderness of snow ,
Till murky night upon them fell .
And melts my passion 's mortal cry
Are forecasts of a kingdom yet to come .
Doth he make the sun rise oft and oft ?
That waves of wealth were washing at my feet !
But here lies the trick of these wonderful men ,
Each quarter to descry the distant foe ,
Time comes when unto wrath these arms , both quiver
The cote where streams do run ;
In whom she put her trust ,
The nimble juice soon seized his giddy head ,
The carriage held but just ourselves
Life 's golden fruit is shed .
The bluebird comes with the winds of march ,
Up in the gold his castle 's battlements pressed .
Ten leagues in height his stature grew .
With no achievements carved about his name .
But when the night had reached its close ,
Abstractedly through life he went ;
With dismal doubt , and sable terror , hung ;
The jay makes answer as the magpie chatters ;
Now all gone to seed ,
Our race of existence is run !
And trees of lovely foliage made
And royal feudal europe sails with thee .
No " minstrel rapture " find for thee ?
Found the lost-words of the master . "
On all who saw came a mighty fear .
" what is freedom fought and won for ?
I bend my soul unto them , stilled
No more her pulses come and go ;
Pillage that ran red-handed through the streets
By the love that can not be told .
All came to him in his dreaming
Where hunters fand the murder 'd bairn ;
The tuneful flute which dying colin gave .
In safety thus apply your harmless toil ? "
Too heavy for mortals to bear .
A lightning conductor caught the tail of my coat .
He sends his thoughts afoot to meet his bride .
Was going , and one following the priesthood ,
And struck into the moors such sudden dread ,
His thanks return 'd for this most pleasant trip ,
But some were sad and felt no mirth ,
Sweet is the smell the blossoms yield ;
I fancied your ardor had taken a chill .
By silvan life inhabited ,
At each new step we feel the burden grow ,
Mother or stepmother ) brings new distress ;
How dearly words want power to show ;
They drove our goodly fighters forth ,
So pass my days . but when nocturnal shades
A flock of pigeons rises with blue wings flashing ,
At bagley , where the rustling bluebells come
You 'll find it of peculiar operation .
The orchard blossoms fall and fade
They loved the lisping winds that came
From joy to sorrow madly whirled ; --
This was a day that knew not age .
In the morning , glad , i see
Then red with rage his eyeballs blazed :
That drug infused , she bade her servant pour
The tower yet stands with gloomy nook ,
But found she was favourite all of a rush ,
The wild rhythms clinched in us ....
To call on fruitless melancholy ,
The morning stars their ancient music make ,
But raged a fiercer war just then ,
Of old rome i find most tedious .
A laugh ran round the circle .
Coarse stuffs and hot flesh weaving together .
A wicked whisper came , and made
Thy mourning makes my heart full sad .
He chuckled silently . the moon came , sweeping
We blighters feel her there .
How through the mighty void the seeds were driven
Conquering that manhood which should them subdue .
The mantle it fades , many rents it reveals ,
When war 's horrid front threatened liberty 's tree .
Should not drive thee from my body ,
Her brow makes light look sallow ;
The colours before us fly ;
Nothing remained but to endure and wait .
The purple shadows steal across the hill ,
And saw it flow away on the wind .
And following triumph which the other brought .
The fault which lies direct from any sin
The registry and label rested safe ;
On memory 's page departed hours inscribes ,
That seeks repose , but finds despair
Yet british politics may turn the scale :
To get an option on her as my steady .
And i , its love , am gained instead !
And death itself his face to miss .
Hate can not harm
Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
Poor mary saw the sunday crowd depart :
She looks best pleas 'd when sorrow flows ,
But a time comes when tide or tempest washes it
Suffering ? it must be relieved .
That sacred night the hero spent .
Steady my pulse , sunk in oblivion 's arms
Put to such trial john bull 's partial patience ,
Soon , issuing forth , shall glitter through the trees
Contemplate here the wonder i unfold .
Foul usury doth not more lift itself
That brings not these deemed fruitless as dry sand .
That fire of feeling freely shone ;
The tense , dead space where silence waits .
A foolish strife ; they see
And war 's unhallow 'd footsteps bore ;
A dragon slowly coils on the scaly curtain .
And filled her with an overpowering dread ;
Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow .
Had given his nostrums some renown .
And draws it from its spotted shroud ,
Of a summer that lived for us ,
They pity me who have grown old , --
Before the breath of life to him was given
Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth ,
We took our way . but we can swear ,
And it pronounced by the president ,
Serves for the wonderful ride he 's taking .
Old glory fairly shouts my way :
Sank as it came , and to its toppling crest
And a roaring breeze and a great moon ,
To calm thy passions , and subdue thy rage :
Her promise sacred , saw him fall asleep .
Or , ever courteous , give the meet reply :
The scenes of horror wrought on either side ,
Within the flame ’s wild fury passed .
That kind of discontent to show
What matters ? naught , if it serves to bring
From death the overwhelming sorrow sprung .
Yes , bright days will come again ,
The scene their leaden , dropping pall ,
Our way through realms of ether held .
Past where the gray stars drift ,
Then pass , ye mourners , cheerly on ,
A city framed of rose and gold ,
In idleness he hatches all his wiles ,
As if the corpse they keep were oozing through --
While i am striving how to fill my heart
The shadows meet
On day 's gray threshold stands the eager dawn ,
There to dwell in amity .
And how they fled the anger of king mark
More tears commanded , or deserved them more !
And heaven and earth are hid from sight ,
In the schoolroom it stands ,
Whatever fades , but fading pleasure brings .
With tapestries , that make its walls dilate
Sorrow may strike at the brightest and best .
Part of the bottom forth , and went his way
Hearts that beat with love so true !
Are plagued with perpetual chills ,
While in its noose of terror bound ,
His weapon hurling , menelaus pray 'd :
To show both plaintiff and defendant
The holy fire that nerved the greek
The ring the false enchantment served to clear .
Their youthful sighs denoted their despair ,
Grow wanton , and give proof to every eye --
Now motionless the ship , the sickness flew ,
The earth that hides things old ,
This one , gnawed by hunger , all the while
If space be ended set upon that end
Endured , would be by this regret outweighed .
Her radiant eyes such living splendours cast ,
Whence our lives come and where they go .
Gently it said that i should stay my steps ;
That ' neath hawthorns hides from view .
He 'd venture the gallows for siller ,
On thee we cast each earthborn care ,
Guittone , giving him the prize , till truth
No need his will outrun :
This to the lunar sphere directs the fire ,
Thy fever calls this immortality ! "
Were crushed , my enterprises lost , my toil
The air is filled with some unknown perfume ;
Thunderstorms come crashing down . forest winds darken .
To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire :
And draws the spirit most unto itself ,
Just try to get the cosmic touch ,
Do you not feel my candles shine
And palaces upon thy bosom glide .
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat !
Themselves men make their comment on mankind ;
There lives a charm that calls my soul away .
Each path to take and every race to run .
And throbbing in the sky grew red and set ;
But thy old age shall calmly pass away ,
And captured by her peerless charms
So dissolves the heart where dwell
So she in darkness her suffering bore ,
And heaped the camp with millions of the dead :
By seeing every good therein exults
Formost to stand against the thunderers aime
Sleep on the bosom that thy lips have pressed !
His loved and lost -- his chime so sweet ,
Midst dreams that come and go ;
God-like and grand all nature is commanding
That strewed for miles the rugged strand ,
Yet unrevenged permits to press the field ;
To voice their high achievement and renown .
A thousand risks and battles still remain ;
That square belief is n't easy to escape .
Love 's hands let slip the reins :
Toward the land that gave them birth
In his bright cell messiah 's vision 'd form .
' she leaves these objects to a slow decay ,
A faith well nigh like ours that king maintains ,
The dreams of youth came back again ;
Hither and thither , gathering store to grieve --
There it was she rocked the fire ,
And when morning met his view ,
They brought down beauty and wisdom from the sky
As autumn , seated on the highest hills ,
But sometimes it may mend , and often reaches .
' t was wonderful how things went on improving ,
With every summer spread a wider shade ,
If the game should seek to fly me ,
Although a dark cloud swept over the plain ,
Thirteen , got fifty pounds a night ;
The penitent shower fell , as down he knelt
He called for armor , which incontinent
Break beneath him with a roar , swelling loud --
When truth should be at last made clear ,
Fate gave the word , the arrow sped ,
This is what the letter said :
One care remains , to note the loyal few
And every tuft of broom gives life
But to us comes no cheering ,
By this the northern wagoner had set
From out the mind will never go .
This the answer that i gave him :
That thy sweet life , rejoicing , hath put on
It answered : " thee as in my mortal frame
Whacked his jugular open and went to smash .
Desireing and desireable he shines ;
Had embraced both ambition and wealth . yet in truth
And when all 's spent that life has given ,
A pity profound to the love which i feel .
Cast upon him this burden of care !
The scene of war came rushing on his sight .
Old poets have sung , and old chronicles tell ,
And that hand a golden knife was holding .
So till the coming night be passed
In whose orbs a shadow lies ,
Of priameïan hector ; burn his rage
Exalted , numbered with the gods , he saw ,
And my pulses beat with rapture in the blisses
The full moon poured her silhouette of me .
As made my childish days rejoice ! _
The vision came and went ,
The sky would hold the moon .
Of lofty praises ; for there came to me
To him experience had already showed ;
May be found in prose the legend
And lo ! thick and fast the other dreams come
Who marshals us our upward way , unsought ;
On the changes that years bring forth ;
Who takes the census of the living dead ,
Of a gerfalcon , soaring into sight ,
That spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray .
And flaming crocus made the mountains glow
There fell a war in a woody place ,
And think , as softly-sad you tread
Down goes a tulip 's noble head !
When in the tent the spirit told his name ,
We 're far behind the age you 'll find
That indra reeling left his foe ,
Wolves make the coward heart their prize !
But possibly the men who make such fuss
And lowly charity , true glory lies ,
To lips that writhed but drank with eagerness .
The fire that late had burnt fell slack
The great event with silent hope attend ,
Laughter light in his eyes there lay ,
Can drive the blood back to the stricken heart ?
These bore the dear departed .
Life , fed from unstanchable springs ?
That such a brook ran water . but i wonder
Answered in the words which follow :
He guards the vision of the sunset sky ;
She shall run upon your errands ,
Through pure clean ways right into heaven go .
November 's mists soon flee december 's snows ;
Bringing the summer , and bringing the sun .
And therefore in herself she stands
Sunsets and dawns such as glowed on the marshes ,
Of resurrection , truth no tongue can tell ,
Ye shall receive the fires that can not fade .
Till it touched the top of heaven ,
And the summer passed , and the winter came ;
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing ;
Where crystal lamps shine most glorious ,
The lark will make her hymn to god ,
Nor attend to the blast ;
That has brought such joy to me .
We leave our nuptial bower to you :
Broad pieces and guineas about now shall fly ,
And rules his bodyless thralls they stand .
For the full heart that thy disgrace would break !
A certain tale i found in one of these ,
From imperfection to perfection borne ,
Yet he can hold his fevers seventy years ,
To show how distant is finality ?
I found it hard , but did my best ;
Frost upon the crops descended ,
What braids of night to hold and kiss !
He lifted up his voice , and cried :
At the fifth hour , darkness took the throne ;
Or living , i 'll rise that day !
And give me power to sway the human race .
As i c 'n raise the money . "
O waste not golden hours to give them heed !
With quivering lips which terror dried :
And place an ambush in the winding way .
And set him on the royal throne
To build the kingdom of god .
The lady took some comfort , and laid by ,
It is hatred that fashioned his shot and shell ,
This holy doctrine ever hold .
Of that sweet music which no ear can measure ;
His sentence given , he waits awhile
The proverb says , harm watch harm catch ,
No blame , no wonder showed there ,
Then autumn crowns the beauteous year ,
And put an end to ceaseless slaughter ;
But pallas held , and the descending blade
There the gay river , laughing as it goes ,
The first delight of ownership is fled .
Which sang of honey and love and wine ,
And like effect of their contention finds .
At dawn the drums of war were beat ,
In pure good will i took this jovial spark ,
Where misfortune 's eye would find me ;
" adam , must thy curse remain ? " --
The night is broken southward ; the springs run ,
It made me glad to be by you .
Suspicious fear her spirit shook .
What the devil makes him cry ?
Where the raw streets stretched sullenly
Distends the darkness .
O'er april dead , my shades i spread :
To speke of love and seche grace .
Inland we held our course ; by palisades
Of the waters it should travel .
What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more !
That comes to all ; but torture without end
Like the dark eternity to come ;
Whose hand directs , whose spirit fills and warms
This led him to commence his operations ,
That my poor hands have built so painfully .
For naught that sets one heart at ease ,
Faint , half-suggested frowns like shadows creep ,
All day the clouds hung ashen with the cold ;
Cease to lament ! i can foresee
Stars leapt and stared at earth and sea .
From his dead friend the pensive warrior went ,
Beyond all wounds the quivering flesh can bear --
But as the ceaseless tempest flew ,
And thanks and praises seem 'd to run
The noble sire fallen on evil days ,
Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased ,
Where all the forms of faith in ruin fell ,
And passed this heritage to me .
Here memory mocks the toil of genius . christ
My eyes of fire are quenched in tears ,
The sun can find a lovely place to die .
Good-morrow gave from brake and bush ;
That bring the fog and mist .
Freedom 's sword will strongly draw ,
Who can in reason then or right assume
" like clouds that shape themselves and go . "
And sometimes are drawn forth sad threnodies
Bring all your hope to naught .
Life awakes and burns ,
Stretching across a void , then guiding o'er
But still there went a something at his side
I leave this light ,
The secret of thy stillness lies unveiled
Fearing her fort may falle .
In which the power of satan broken is :
With which he ran his turbid race ,
Your jokes may pass without offence .
" by this the northern wagoner had set
That wrecked a city and made chieftains die .
Thus addressed the stranger-heroes :
His speech addressing to the godlike man .
And pious awe , that feared to have offended .
Still comes upon the thorny bowers
For the hand in life that grasped it ,
And held the pass to splendid goals .
Small noises move among the grass ...
When he sought the italian frontier ,
Right to his mark the monster went --
The richest ever flowed in english veins
While sorrow will follow and find if we roam .
With gathering strength each devious pathway takes ;
But presently you feel that you will die
This trial of our faith will make us whole ,
Sweating the sail , their passionate play and change ,
And the storm has ceased to blow .
From his bowed eyes seemed any light to come ,
Was far too freely moved to tears .
Thus is her life still guarded ,
Then , as magic fell amid them ,
For he , from whom these emanations came ,
Life 's golden fruit is shed .
The sound came straitened and strange ;
Grows fiercer as the seasons pass .
His faith and love henceforth to show .
Revealing -- as the skies unfold --
Thus did the master fill me with alarm ,
Where no light has late been burning ,
O'er all the man conflicting passions rise ;
Of hideous doubt that stabs her soul to death .
And marked the way to conquest and renown ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
There blew a chill wind from the hill
Thy waters sparkle as they run ,
To give rings of gold . of gilded cups
Having made this long speech the captain suddenly remembered the
Thou ' lt break my heart , thou bonnie bird
Rooted in death , enriched with all decay ?
And he spoke the words which follow :
To the nightmares as they go .
Evil spirits drive her with secret arrows ,
Hid in the heart of every amethyst .
One the shutters drew --
And the field quivers where the panic goes .
Then arise among the nation ;
And left him alone with his shame and sin .
Its face , once grim , now leads to him
That follow the wind in the fall ;
And from the rage of battle gently drew :
He makes it fastest go .
Sleep i took not for my bedfellow ,
All its sweetness gone to others ,
Which makes the wise heart certain of its ends .
He held imprisoned since his young hot dawn .
Before the tented hall drew rein ,
And hearts be turned to ashes in its path ;
Of which my comedy cares not to sing ,
Was startled when an answer really came .
That lay in the house that jack built .
Of that great earth that draws a breath and stirs
Lost in a way that made search vain ,
It feeds me , fainting , with a stone :
Soon wild commotions shook him , and made flush
Still feels that high moment unfurling
Of dreams of love that came before i knew ,
Joy rings his bells in my waiting ears ,
The wind , wild rushing o'er the hill ,
And he had gathered , from all wealth of lore
Like household memories come ;
Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain ,
Whose every word i find a well of wisdom ,
Leaving his shores to visions , where he saw
Who worships the great god , that instant joins
May soothe him while they whisper of the past ;
And trample down rebellious lust ,
His soul was filled with such delight
Lost in his new desire
And on the trees hung grass and bark
Their tongues are tempered into two-edged swords .
The current of life runs ever away
The cart and oxen , drawing the holy ark ,
Towers that the salt winds vainly beat .
And brought the needful presence of a god .
A train of phantoms in wild order rose ,
For boaz , when the honeymoon was spent ,
Will bring the victory .
With the inspiring smile that ever lit
And _ honour _ , based on manly truth ,
That points the way to heaven :
Where the white foam flashed headlong to the sea :
They let nor idol nor image stand ;
Thy soothing , settling rest .
The craftsman 's best would take
The road runs twisted like a snake
To light and life shall spring .
Once again success has crowned
All along this stirring epoch
From out the strait to take his northward way
And where the river entered and went out ,
Without reward the flower serves the bee .
And morning sings with a warm odorous mouth .
Of those rich thoughts the miser passion stored !
Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace ,
And the sea 's kisses set his blood aglow ,
The thoughts which musing pity pays ,
Lost in his meditations . what may be
The whole armada raked the reeking seas .
His knotted arrows pierced and tore
Lie here embraced by deeper death than we ;
The shadow of his loss drew like eclipse ,
The damsel plights her promise not to bear ;
There they lay in wait for kwasind ,
That drinks the greenness from the ground ,
To rome removed , with wit secure to please ,
With all the wealth he could collect with speed .
The snow hath retreated
Through every age its fires will burn --
To war and arms i fly .
This nation of nations whose heart is awaking ?
To see the menace at laurentum hurled ,
We 'll take the hero to our arms .
As though it felt its work was through ,
Nor brought him back one branch of grace .
Then martin , angry , threw his tackle down :
So architecture answered music 's call .
Her heart responded to his silent cry ;
Heaven itself seemed shown to me in gleams .
To slay aeneas , and his arms obtain .
Of her arm 's weariness she gave no sign ,
This says , just such an involuted beauty
My flat strewn words would rise and come more near
And the mosque crescent struggled into sight
I , feeling that you felt me worthy trust ,
The fountain tossed its water ,
Sheep , like small clouds touched with light ,
And whispers ran around . those ugly girls ,
Part of the bottom forth , and went his way
So , when across the swinging smoking seas ,
After each other , next their forces stirred ;
While wintry winds whistle and fast flies the snow ,
Long , long the shadows fall .
Balm to men 's hearts , upon them laid ;
I raised the lids o ' the truth ,
Before the saint vaśishṭha stood
The other went upon his road .
And leave their life beneath the soaring cloud .
The shades renewed the pleasures life held dear :
And makes the ivy climb the oak ,
I see them all herein combine :
The symbol which you seek is found in you .
Thy fair form no flies dare seize .
And to my lips a whisper stole , --
That buried nature was not dead in her ,
Attend their steps , some follow , some precede ,
And the sorrowful cadence of good gone wrong ,
I found no truth in one report at least --
The waves reflect it like a drunken star .
And him to whom it was addressed ! "
And some at blackboards station took .
And holy water for lustration bring .
His name remain .
Only bring sorrow and sadness to me .
Fancy makes me more than king ;
O bloom of youth profusely shed !
Which by and by black night doth take away ,
A frail cloud trailing o'er the midnight moon ,
And my cold blood hangs shivering in my veins ;
And poised himself to meet the coming death ,
A livid cloud , and to the battle flew .
What tragedy hast thou , indeed , not seen ?
Flames in the breast each faded ember ,
It feels the wings , and wants the sky .
In all the little hollows cored with ice
Marvel how brightly life may shine .
And over wastes where silences held reign ,
And fierce the din of battle rose ,
And all we love into the grave is gone ,
While sorrow will follow and find if we roam .
Hearts stored with song and joke
And hold the sunshine in its lap
The one the other , other spouse to take .
Gilded margins count a sin ,
Such was my love -- she scorn 'd to hide
It 's only cross old gardeners find you bad .
And sweeps the ground in grief ,
No later light has lightened up my heaven ,
The golden wand , that causes sleep to fly ,
So , from the throne his influence he sheds ,
God gives them not the grace . ”
Must flicker up each face as past they sail .
Some simple ballad , framed by rustic muse ,
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss .
Ruin and silence of the night 's amassing :
It shall reach his disciples in every clime ,
From his shining feathers shed off the cold sun ;
For stars were pointing to the morning hour .
Seemed infinite ; and there his spirit shaped
Their hearts by courage stirred , and their good swords
The present finds us hale and hearty yet ,
And in the body can not meet and love ,
The troubled waters slowly settling shake :
The moment , rounded to eternity ,
On this altar 's steps were laid
All join great nature 's praise to hymn ,
Where cairo stands , or memphis stood .
No evidence gives he .
Though oft i turn 'd the wistful eye ,
A witch and a goblin led the sprites ;
Sometimes the creature , who the power possesses ,
And let the loss thou hast sustain 'd
Held by fraternity in bonds that are sure ,
To mark the mutual-kindling eye .
I hear the bell struck in the night ;
Thy ken directed to the point , whereat
Can you recall it
Except to pass an hour away :
What needeth then apologies be made ,
And leave thee lonely !
And sad forms flitting here and there ,
The brotherhood that keeps blood sweet :
Or mark the rolling year ?
My great travail so gladly spent ,
Who shed thy tears like crocodile ;
And breaking into stars , an omen sent
The quivering brook , as warmer breezes blew ,
They note the polished art of trumper ,
Our hearts , my love , were formed to be
Doubts naturally , and finds it hard to trust .
Where the waves beat against the shore .
Take heed ! and bring us back once more
Filled with life , one single grain ,
With fragrant herbs and branches spread .
While so the battle stands , king charlemagne
Softly seeking admittance , with plaintive appeal ,
These i see ,
And yet to give him warning , for he rode
He took his place upon the double throne ,
A due respect for those above him placed ,
With such fell cruelty were seen , their goads
Than what she gave in buying what she sold :
And faintly fainter , fainter seems to go .
The sad assembly sat ; when weeping fast
Four seasons fill the measure of the year ;
It loseth many bodies of stark cold
All melted into him ; they swallowed up
The snow of years lie visibly , and so
And if their pathway were not thus inflected ,
When doom ’s wild tempest sweeps the waves ,
By us forms his laws and rules ,
The many straps which tight they drew .
She might have made this and that other world
One star has pointed to the sun ,
He missed the medieval grace
And makes of thee a valley of sad tears ,
With such fell cruelty were seen , their goads
Piercing the spirit through with cruel woe .
He knew no murder and he felt no fear .
Is like a hand laid softly on the soul ;
I saw a vision of faith .
Or did you treading through the froth call to
The lord of light had sunk and set :
As fits the merry christmas time .
And by this plan , so falsely shown ,
Everything went well till we reached the barn
And make the desert smile .
" led by a finer tact , a gift
Full charged with thunder and the bolts of death .
In vain they follow . hopeless they return .
When odes of triumph sound his praise . --
And his mood alter 'd with the tidings brought :
In the east no cloud was rising ,
Had he to shield his life from harm .
The brook ? whose wisdom knows no other song
Answered soft , taking counsel of mercy ,
Darkness and horror stood ! but from the space
That servants make the worst of lords .
While the drums roared and rolled and beat
To store up treasure with incessant toil ,
Sich fine circumstances ort to make us satisfied ;
When all the world lay burning in the sun
Is his , a tribute unto darkness paid ;
Here is the place where loveliness keeps house ,
Let manners teach thee where to be
Which neither feels nor fears .
To raise fresh funds i was forced to fly ,
Less sense than instinct caught the wing that shone ,
Till younger lives come all their love to prove .
The empty picture which our fancy drew .
And bid me still the effort kind prolong ;
Thus matters went on , and the lawyer grown rich
So from my birth the sisters fixed my doom ,
From whose branches trailed the mosses ,
The boisterous guests approach that were invited .
Till magnus ' body mingled with its flames .
Through green leaves lift their walls of gray ;
Yet all of that small troupe in misery stuck ,
Columbia 's sons in virtuous actions shine :
Either that slumbering knowledge of socrates ,
Which , hearing rescued israel , stood erect ,
The nights are filled with dread ,
Sweet are the summer wreaths that twine
Yet still the same dear promise came ,
To go three journeys ere your letter came .
Spread melting rings where late a swallow dipped .
The sun has sunk in the crimson west ,
And my soul passed doubt and fear !
Urging for reason , nought so ill could show
Who will dare to stem their wrath ?
The flame that fell on bards of old
That it jerked the philosopher out of his cell .
His foeman ’s body pierced and rent .
That filled the air with smoke of vain desires ,
How my heart serves thee with its every prayer .
The rest were sharing in the general feast :
But when once more they found themselves deserted ,
Her eye should light on any younger lover . "
And found almost exhaustless hidden wealth .
Or the weeping that drowns the laugh ?
Take note of thy departure ? all that breathe
Love with eternal knot had linked the fair ,
Thy falling teares keep faithfull time .
For dissolution wrought by sin , that first
The morn has come , and where are they ?
Dire fate has always frowned .
All human courage gives , or takes away .
But making money , slowly first , then quicker ,
To excuse the freedom i have taken ;
Give me no blessings , save as recompense
That lit the velvet blossoms which we trod ,
The dark futurity , which lies
To whom we our love disclose ?
Dead on whose threshold lies heart-broken hate ,
Is there faith in the figures i seize ?
Who bound the bar or senate in their spell ?
Is built ; and therefore substance it intends .
Only to show , how many tastes he wanted .
While grand old flags around it float ,
When consciousness came back , he found he lay
The dusk flames burn beneath them , and on high
And touched is every heart that 's gathered there .
No longer fate allows the choice between
Hath shut a glimpse of paradise
For words must shrink from these most wordless woes ;
Is pietie thus and pure devotion paid ?
_ honour and pride the first shall lend ;
The fields are stretched and stare
Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl ,
The elm-tree stretches its branches wide ,
Her banner it shall ride the air
When there came a voice , of warning
Can give a worthie epithite .
A chiseled calm that wore ;
Then added , turning to my guide his face ,
That i the tenour of my creed unfold ;
And that their discord , as their union , grew
Then came with it treason ;
His master , and his answer made .
And the creek of life goes winding on ,
Bring the prayer of a little one . "
Freed from the curse that on it lay ,
Wave upon wave that broke and whirled
And break my will against god 's will ,
And in the hedge what quick agreement goes ,
A valiant wind the vanguard leads ;
Where poor evander kept his country court .
A hermit ’s wailing smote my ear :
Then found he nothing wanted to his heart ,
Could i get this by longing : vain !
To guide the nation ,
And from her lips her words slow trembling came ,
The darkness settled in . kassandra cast
Thy legacies another way did go :
Love hath given the day for longing ,
To preach a gospel born of rage .
Our way we held , more rugged than before ,
Who lies the most is still the most believed .
What makes a body saving quantity ?
For force will take the help i ask .
Responding to my knock , my heart went up ,
With inborn valor force their fortune on ?
As on wounds the scarf winds tight .
Contains them mingled and gives forth discrete .
For talents mourn , untimely lost
For this is the hardest of all to bear ,
Can wrong make right ? "
Then addressed the words that follow :
And she gave her heart to me .
That the world hath seen . --
His young heart set beating at every chance meeting --
The weary moon 's dim lustre fails --
Yea , rather from the first her tale explain .
Tears standing in their eye ,
Within his soul the hero showed
And spend many an anxious hour ;
Who gave the hope , then brought the blight ,
And gazed where inland waters lay
See , a new athens rising in the west !
These songs may keep her memory beautiful .
Her chimney smoke was blowing blue and faint ,
This passage achaemenides had shown ,
Through the thick deserts headlong urged his flight :
The crowds dissolve , and thou alone art there ,
The bells swing to and fro ,
Let it go -- give me one tear ,
Bounding o soul thou journeyest forth ;
And o'er the frame a tremulous shudder went ,
The city sinks to rise no more .
Set her little heart a-breaking ,
And showers of gentler sadness bathe the night .
Nor other sound the silence broke ,
To neptune ’s ear soft sleep his message brings ;
To calm their feelings and restrain their fears .
And talent sinks , and merit weeps unknown ;
Her farther speech awaited ; on her lips
The moonlight fell , glossing the sable tide
Afflictions sent , dire evils to remove .
Forever clasped in silent vows !
Wealth sought and kings adventured life to hold .
Of this distress , and made me break those laws
The flashes come and go ;
New day of living doth new insight teach .
His way he wins , his post maintains --
Thus ere the christmas goes the spring is met
Not more thy wisdom than her virtue shined ;
A plot against his peace had tried .
Why in his wisdom he hath led me so .
The cruel leak gained fast .
The red rays pierce the waters flowing ,
The ill effects that rise from such a plan ,
Pray do you ever catch a mouse ,
Should be classified as treason ,
Life that no chance may spare or save ,
And feel with pain each pleasing passion die ! ---
The creeping plants that o’er it twined .
The sullen fiend her sounding wings display 'd ,
On earth , when strong the northern tempest blew .
Till the important day at last came round ;
And heaven will hear the humble prayer i make ,
May it arouse the sweetness of your own .
This beauty will unloose our bonds of care .
Serenely as the stars gaze through the air
Slime that was venom ; i followed the fiery
Put sixpence a hundred on cigars .
And , guided only by memory 's light ,
Their bodies got ; but laundry soap
From paradise , because it turned aside
A race ! a race ! which will win ,
That there the hope of israel trod ;
Of suffering flowed a secret spring of joy ,
Made its passage safe and certain ,
I would forget the wounded heart you gave me ,
No trembling word the mother 's joy revealed ,
Beneath our trembling roof of sea .
And truth and constancy had vowed ,
Of christ and church , if loosed beyond
That of the forest , every fan they broke .
Now follow cheerful to the trembling town ;
The hope to dolon fresh assurance gave .
Were these which had made him her friend ?
Your fortune was as good as made ,
The naming heavens together roll ;
As it goes down the world .
Though sleep and death were whispering low .
With lips set firm and brow a-frown ,
If chance some heedless heart should roam ,
Still , magic finger , weave your potent spell ;
And all the sweet buttermilk watered the plain .
Genius face the giant sin ;
Came wailings , as of suffering souls .
To look upon the torture of long death ,
The orchards turn to heaps o ' rosy cloud ;
Thy ken directed to the point , whereat
The groaning trees untimely shed their locks ,
Then to the sibyl 's palace bore the prize .
But make answer first , who thou art ,
When lust 's hot wind begins to blow .
He meets at every turn the fiend remorse ,
Funereal clouds melted to shimmering gray ;
Where they keep the houses warm .
When the tapers now burn blue ,
Our fate held close within his quiet hands .
Against the course of nature lay outstretched
Let me in turn thy favour find ; and grant
Now sevin long years is gone and past ,
Do n't you look for trouble ;
Dare to give where gifts belong ,
None can turn time back , and no man delay
" o wagner , westward bring thy heavenly art ,
Pathetic were their words , and well they aim 'd
That crowned the eastern copse : and chill and dun
King arthur held his careless holiday : --
Whose madness in their ode breathes .
They gave him credit for cunning and skill ,
And make good the anarchy .
She vowed her heart was mine to take
Where the water bounds the elfin land ;
Her steps imprint the night-frost hoar ,
And the water-breezes rocked it ,
That dream shall break in terror ; he shall see
Some woman 's eyes have robbed my happiness ...
With weight of years oppressed ;
But an alien tongue , with phrases formed ,
To quench the fire of anguish in some eye
Who still follow on where delusion shall lead them .
His mortal part alone , his soul was caught
Out of that raving tide is drawn betwixt
And sear my lips with kisses burning-sweet ,
In all committed to his trust ,
Thy ever-youthful waters keep
And in his breast awakens new desires .
So lofty that i feel my brain turn round ,
These vapours gathered to one shining hope ,
Of his then rushing thoughts -- like chords ,
The little stars sat , one by one ,
His name confessed in heaven ;
The springing tears that to his eyes up came ;
With slow still touch on each decaying grace ;
And left the monster all alone
Behind the ancient who lavinia took ,
And nothing left for love to look upon .
A car triumphal : on two wheels it came
Chafed at its boundaries , he made reply
The place he found beyond expression bright ,
With all perfections , so enflame my sense
And bring disgrace upon a father 's name ?
The doubts that in his heart arose : and now
When love and womanhood come this way :
It chanced one day , when the north wind blew
Thus action rises over thought , and sets
With holier , tenderer beauty shining ;
Or make one mourner weep the less ?
The heart cast bleeding to feed the ideal ,
The queen of love with faded charms she found .
Some lonely soul , which walks apart and feeds
And in his ear she breathed a spell .
Past doubt her wisdom , taking from mad war
Apart from all that i hold dear ,
And the clouds lay piled in the glittering sky !
Stands up to keep the goal .
No sound the rest of nature did invade .
She said ; a rising sigh expressed her woe ,
Will give you peace ; go and profane
And soften all the hills with mist ,
Give them the sunshine ,
Would rest the changing seasons through .
But rapture and beauty they can not recall .
A feast of fruits and wines was laid --
Making for graceless things a grace ,
Whose hearts burned with bitter hatred
Thy scent will be to bliss invited ;
Mad heat that beats like a blood .
Was caught up into love , and taught the whole
So that their fear is turned into desire .
Far as the flames extended , quench we first
Appeared a warrior fitted for her needs ;
Along the ridges takes her way ,
These murmuring voices that rise and fall ?
O why that bliss destroy !
Love flies the haunts of pomp and power ,
So that their fear is turned into desire .
Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine ,
He pined and sighed his soul away .
Night , horror , darkness thick the place invade ,
Till awful from the shades arise the seer .
The soldier -- he held honours martial ,
Aye , we will follow the flag
Strange how such innocence gets its own way .
Making all the vales rejoice ?
For shame leave this wicked employment ,
He knew , he knew how the whisper went !
And sought with truthful words his heart to reach :
Your experience will widen when explicitly you learn
Up the sun came boating .
To the land where all roads meet .
But when the priest the closing words let drop
Fair summer sets upon her beauteous brows .
Deep thunder rolled in long portentous sound ,
What cares had come , had lightly flown ;
Headlong all the turrets hurling ,
" who put the french to rout ;
The breeze it blew so stiff ;
That ye held by the fifteenth psalm . "
Raised the slave race of men
Thy tears teach her to weep .
Pure as winds that winnow snow ,
" for he has spread such passing fear among
The common lot we scarce perceive .
And shot the shining mischief to the heart !
By filial love be forced to be untrue ,
I found god 's people rich in pity ,
They fell to close encounter . priam 's son
The present terror rushed again ;
Impetuous splendor of its rushing by . --
With shame took to flight .
Then as the fiend prepared to bound
Then the hostess , filled with kindness ,
Who at the last encountered love for foe .
And eyes with tears are aching ,
Who can tell but nature said ,
The baby , and the breast its fingers grasp --
From the lost nectar-streams of golden youth ,
Old civilizations pass , the new come on .
Late time must echo ; worlds unborn resound .
While autumn pelted it with chestnut burrs ,
The roaring storm 's unguided strength ,
So saying , his silver-studded sword he gave
His whole thought on honor lies :
And as the happy moments flew ,
The dog he made another essay ,
As if with fettered feet that stay her going .
In lieu of expressing the feelings which lay
Such grace the heavens doo to my verses give .
The noble lovers use well might you see ,
And if their smiles encountered , he went mad ,
Of the future what it can not give them .
It would have made the boldest shudder ;
The garish mosses spread with dainty hands ,
Heaven took through death from out her earthly place ,
The whole of that host came following through .
That sees thy hand in everything ,
" for love reflects the thing beloved ; "
Or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell .
In a sweet stillness shut away from care .
With looks and smiles that spoke of heaven ,
Her nails were blackened and split with labour ,
After long thought , to this advice he leans :
The kindness she hath shown ,
I oft will recall how you chased away sadness ,
It sat prepared to leave the ways .
The startled waves leap over it ; the storm
A happy wife , bring joy to him .
With carbuncles do shine ;
Silenced the hissing , chased the darkness round ,
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
But ' twill not always do , we see .
Shall into god 's diviner light emerge .
No temples raised to money 's majesty ;
Each by strange wisps to strange abysses drawn ;
Smooth sliding from the higher clouds she comes ;
Wave over wave the driving desert swims ,
When earth over her face night 's mantle wraps ;
Would you gain of fame a niche ?
Whence her soul she can not wean , --
To see the shelter where their souls had fed
What best i see in thee ,
Of life was cut , and closed thy span !
One sink of level avarice shall lie ,
Which closed the scene of martyrdom among
But i have lived to see thy church arise ,
And give him thankful praise . "
Then those delights my mind might move ,
I sometimes think the rock worn with adventures ,
Of the candles that shed their soft lustre
Thy shores no longer reaching ; and the earth ,
I wore , undreaming of relief ,
Of disobedience ; firm they might have stood ,
The distant heart to reach .
Could cut no sharper than the gentle voice
A table loaded with things to eat
Nothing whatever did it say to us ,
And pardon was better , we reckoned ,
Built in his active youth , long lazy life
She stole the graces ' silken smiles ;
Doth make thy whole warm earth a-cold !
Our hearts ran o'er like a gushing well ,
His way directed where the ancient led .
Is risen to reach the shining shores of light ,
Hear where young birds hold their high festival ;
Mankind to gain their life and to advance ;
And folly in as ample measure meet ,
The dull clods swell into the sullen mound ;
The summer 's put the idy in
Till troy ’s proud structures should in ashes lie .
But heaven holds all for which you sigh .
It stands so lonely in the sky
The distant life-boat hope sustained .
And the hurt in her heart he nursed ;
But silence steals the song .
And the farmer glows and beams in his glee ;
But echo gathers in the wind ,
And bowed with mighty force to form the stock ,
And forgiven . he bitterly went on to speak
The tree of my song stands bare
This eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight ;
Or they with thee , hold conversation meet ?
Serene and fixed in the blue above ?
And thus his guilty soul declares .
Where the wind calls our wandering footsteps we go .
That calls my few friends to my funeral ;
So meanly passes , that all other lots
Like these i feel , thy life shall close :
Only to make the cold winds blow ,
The clouds with orient gold spangle their blue ;
What has the artist caught ? the sensual chin
But when a rumour rose about the queen ,
And now and then a sigh he stole ;
Stand up and meet the war .
In stating this a tear escaped her eye .
And for the rest , summon to judgments true ,
And lifts to heaven his steadfast eye ,
The holly-leaves their fadeless hues display
On the eldrich creature falls strangely cold .
The eternal silences were broken ;
An hour had passed above me ; i had reached
And jim was fined before the foreman went .
Everything that gives thee pleasure .
Took a beguiling whisper to his ear ,
That gave that warning sign ;
Whose might can make or shatter , love !
On flocks and herds their youthful fury pour ,
Are brought : and feel by turns the bitter change
And pray that stormy waves may lash the beach .
' t will bring good fortune .
Had put a rapture in her breast ,
Bleeding and torn from freedom 's mountain bounds ,
External trifles with our sorrows blend !
Where brightest joys and virtues shine ?
All the fragments come together
And leave behind all sorrow .
Now time approached to end by storm the war ,
Can show more different hues than i :
Thoughts disappear . this very day
Of his free bounty , who had made them apt
Emblem of general maternity lifted above all ,
Is the vesture left me to commune with ?
She found the better way to preach .
Where virtue calls , where glory leads the way ,
I broke my life there . let it stand
That every hyacinth the garden wears
Against me -- the hoarse thunder drowned her shrieks !
Who restrained their lusts and wishes ,
That to learning and knowledge may lay a pretence ;
O'er land or people to hold sovereign sway ;
So beautiful and pitiless he went ,
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
As the allied flags go by .
Kill dat chicken an ' give him a thigh .
Pure in the lowest artisan was seen .
What gentlest touch may take ?
These lightly skimming , when they swept the plain ,
Leading the nation into dangerous errors ,
' my wind comes weak ,
Their cause they to an easier issue put ;
Ears he fashioned for the maiden ,
He lies with the sweetheart he chose .
Give all your heart to little things .
The ruins they are reaching down ,
Having , found admittance ,
And lend to the rhyme of the poet
And still leaves brought me thought ,
Is driven from his blissful seat .
Thou show ' st the stirrings of that flame ,
Though flower-bonds were set
Though fate frowned ,
Of scamps that ever cheered the devil .
The wind hath blown a gale all day ,
Casting about for words and strength to speak .
And gain 'd the island where our vessels lay .
The spacious hall his father placed , to whom
But with its sound it shook the sails ,
Look how the folds of the union are spreading !
As passion fills the sail , and fancy steers .
A prince the father of a people made .
Each future day increase of wealth shall bring ,
But sluggishly they seek their end --
That only said , live and rejoice ?
When my hand passed from wire to wire
Feigned to make proof of his agility ;
You lean your face upon your hands and cry ,
Superfluous matter came , shot out in ears
And other trophies that your tact shall find .
For in it she did take such pride ,
To sorrow abandond , but worse felt within ,
Your weapons enter , and your strokes they feel .
Did he know what with it came ?
Which made them heads most fit to be
His breath lent fragrance to the gale ,
And find no faith to light them from afar ;
Mingling with the anguish , rolled the solemn organ ...
Thus he his courteous counsel unto his lords applied .
Which tenfold force gives nature 's law .
Against the crime of law , which gave
Answer in the words which follow :
And swept by winds that warred against the will ,
For her heart in his grave is lying .
And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood . "
Let dreams still lengthen thy long glades ,
And on the surface shone the holy store .
Then as they passed a striking vision came ;
I live to hail the season --
Vapour adust doth never mount above
Or love , the flower that closes up for fear
That argued her a queen , and on her side
And hope 's young promises were all made good ;
Half lost in sacred sweets , and bless 'd
And the flames rose up in brightness ,
Where snakes and silvan creatures made
Salve gives the witches strength to rise ;
A memory of easy days gone past ,
Death must now thine eye forever hide !
But to behold the cruel strife stood nigh .
With vanished vigils , melancholy made ,
Which makes me soar a pitch so passing high ,
Or loosed in tears ;
What eagle ever missed the peak he sought ?
Nor clashing gates pursue his loaded steed ;
Britain , stand fast !
In poverty or pride love comes and goes ,
Together in one sheaf ? what style could suit ?
Oh , once to feel thy spirit anear ;
Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow ,
There comes a cry from baby boy
Their accents did resound .
And when the noonday breezes blew ,
Take my advice , let reason bear her sway ,
And then he tried to muster all his patience .
The darkness came to hide my tears and share
Silence comes upon the night ,
Worthy of this ambrosial sin , so shown ,
Greatly they wonder 'd what the thing might mean :
In gentle numbers time so idly spent ;
How shall i find it now night is come ?
Angry grew and swore for vengeance ,
To sink in your rosy bondage bound .
And so my gallant falcon breathed his last
An icy film is caught ,
The light that burned amid the approaching gloom
As white pearls hide in a dusky shell .
The young braves came stamping ,
To keep me from the peace of those
Back to the flowers rushed the dew ,
That gave thee birth ;
Bring the new music of mankind to birth ,
Make day a loathing to the light it brings .
Hast thou gone sadly through a dreary night ,
Spears plunged into men 's flesh : dread ares drank
Which is the life that makes the death ,
No ill upon thy bosom weighs ,
Ye trees that fade when autumn-heats remove ,
The church in glowing vesture stood ,
And heartless brains sad hearts control --
Thinking to win thee time to snatch thy breath ,
That told youth 's heart-felt revelry ;
What tears there , bared to weather ,
The big round tear hung trembling in his eye :
The reckless laugh untouched of pain or ruth , --
Along the waters lay ;
The cock his courage shows ;
She that kept it in constant good humour ,
Which knows no doubt , which feels no fear .
Hiding the ache of the tragic
Queen and darling of us all -- she found
And all around appeared to give them joy ,
And within it came a people
A simple nymph it is , inclined to muse
And her restless eyes that show
With summer-spice the humming air , "
And make your care and sorrow less .
The fields in glinting beads of dew stretched endlessly ,
O faint of heart , to whom this life appears
She gave his frame . but hercules at last
The wound i suffer , never find a cure .
Slept like a lake till love threw in
Without taking any freedom ,
" my clay with long oblivion is gone dry :
To thy father show my prayer
Fight , and redeem or yield up life . ”
Nor where the tropics bound the realms of day
And exquisite hunger , at her heart love lay
Four years pass before the job is done .
Stole through the crimson hues the ruby gave ,
Her stately path , sheds starry coronals .
When woke to sense the stricken train ,
That seizes first the opulent , descends
A restless captive . now has fortune dealt
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew ,
Now the trees have laid their foliage ,
These are the days when skies put on
Of darksome pines , a babbling fountain played ,
And spreads it through the land :
By whom to that crisis the matter was brought .
Had turned to a living song .
Moves and directs thee ; then no flattery needs .
I bring a gift of tears ,
How risa open to the foe he laid ,
There set in order my experiences ,
And the drums strike more convulsive ,
At length an author 's one great work appeared ,
The fitful radiance came : --
On the mat her hands lay idle ,
In life sheds perfume all around ;
Her shape arises ,
His soul stood like a moon within his eyes ,
There came a mighty wind , and seized the guest
Eight steeds of noble lineage drew .
And no proud honour to thyself redounds .
Far as his sight extends , who from on high
Her tears should drop on them perpetually .
Which damns the crowd around the guillotine .
There where any death might seize me ,
He kept himself , the present course to run .
Jove would lay aside his thunder ,
That childish fancy made ;
Why happiness pursued , though never found ?
Her breath absorb thy sighs .
Shouts once and brings him from his high employ .
Could not such employment still yield you delight ,
A portrait taken after death .
Yet of old fraud some footsteps shall remain . ]
Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
Send forth prophetic sounds before they smite .
Of tempest , or to shun the rock .
It was fashioned cunningly day by day
Much learning shows how little mortals know ;
Unconscious then of what fate held in store --
Machinery just meant
That the mowers brought that day
' neath the picture hung fresh gathered
But every thought of rest would kill
Take from my life the beauty that you found ,
And his glad heart with triumph swelled .
To the floor it hangs in beauty ,
Of love has touched the fuel of desire ,
Saw once again the heat of harvest fume
And full of winding mysteries of ways :
Before the gates the grecians took their post ,
Three hosts combine to offer sacrifice ;
Pain to things that feel and live :
Where jane 's light footsteps go .
Low it comes like sighs in dreams ;
All my spirit felt to thee ;
But , scarcely has my heart been taught
Till sleep takes place of weariness ;
What ghastly huntsman next arose ,
No lance or warlike shield it bears :
Nor will i here remain an hour ,
And yet the devil can not make it .
But the heaving sea was black behind
There had the persian 's thousands stood ,
Where the marsh-water lies ,
A weary bee ... . and scarce it pushes
A spacious garden lay , fenced all around
May wake the cannon 's fearful boom ,
These words which rage and courage might provoke :
Far above all boons we hold it :
And what prevention in foreknowledge lies .
The unexpected day at last is come ,
Two added provinces blest dara 's sway .
His goodly spirit should move forth , returning
Shall make thy actions with their ends to meet .
On one whose bosom bleeds to doubt thee :
Thus hermit-like his life he leads ,
I 'd creep , and go on seeming
The clouds their backs together laid ,
Take my counsel , happy man :
And giveth shade to shade ,
That thought remained , it was not drowned .
But answer came there none --
Blithe as the wind was bitter , drew
The wind goes high on the hills ,
A stately mansion stands aloof
That turns to naught the lilac 's miracle ,
Cast you down on the close-cropped turf ,
" beer i bear to thee ,
His paynim bands dispersed in panic fright .
To the unhappy flordelice shall show ?
Thick in the stagnant moat the lilies lay
God 's blessing must be resting on the fruit --
Whatever comes with years .
What of elizium 's missing ,
The city stands , unstained of sin ;
And now was dropped into the western bay ;
As from glass is cut our wit ,
But fraud , who makes one of this multitude ,
With their dilated nostrils spread ,
There come the jingling of a team ,
Bearing the likeness of a king himself ,
Some shaggy weeds that floated on the swelling tide .
And long his tears of anguish flowed .
Then will she feel her hopeless state ,
The light in the dust lies dead --
Let the war go rolling on alone for awhile ,
The setting sun his legions placed ,
Doubtless a different fate had found .
Of strife has seized him , onward borne ,
To her left hand came the blue .
It only gilds the gambler 's strife ,
I would i had thrust my hands of flesh
His wild tory eye on the heavens he set :
And spend many an anxious hour ;
Wither 'd hands , her woes revealing ;
Yet of their joyance he takes no share ,
Virtue would stain that o'er with silver white .
To keep his anxious spirits free
Then forth sprang gabriel 's wings , off fell
And the larks still mount to the sky ,
" falls cold and ceaseless wore my heart away .
To make more vent for passage of her breath ;
Where rests peace that never dies .
That hangs above this heaven-favored land ,
Tear follows tear , my steadfast heart obeying
You feel that you must pass from earth
Know virtue taught thee , not thyself .
Compassion 's bed you share .
Yet , on the threshold of your life i placed
Met one another , both , like sinners caught ,
And so the quarrel grew .
Not to sleep art thou conducted ,
And greece triumphant held a general feast ,
They hesitate , trembling and filled with shame ,
So sternly fix 'd upon the evening sky ;
Are diluted with emptiness ...
To find the place of souls that i desire .
Nor break , nor crack you see ;
I could not feel a pain .
It winna break .
Ilmarinen joined his snow-sledge ,
Attracts them , follow ) , might ascend thus far
Mixed with the musk that drifted
Where i last night came
Lovers , when they lose their breath ,
The wax face lifts ; the eyes open .
And in these petals peace i bring :
To clear the palace from the foe , succeed
The lark will make her hymn to god ,
Here lies the hoarded love , the key
The summer passed , the autumn came ; the stalks
No part of that fell curse inherit ,
And to make them wise and happy .
His spirit found ; his deeds now draw us
I bore him , burning with my wrongs ,
It owns a lord
The train without him flies .
By homely anguish strung .
What breath shall fill and re-inspire
A numbness crept through every limb .
Trembles , when any spirit feels itself
Its heavenly strength to lift or bend . ”
When the snow has gone that drifted them under ,
That leads to heaven 's eternal day .
That hangs before her all the year ,
His eyes stared into the eyes of me
And the mouldering dust that years have made
Where that tumultuous flood has been , i see
Which from thy lips in anger broke :
I fear the broadswords will be drawn . "
And yellow lilies islanded in light .
Up leapt the solemn priests from dull repose :
Reason now left it to the flow of soul .
The hour is coming , when ye neither shall
Some fill their hands for love of bloom ,
A huge and frightful billow broke ; it whirled
But oh , for those this day can bring ,
Or make agreement with her thrilling eyes ;
The moon comes momently .
For death , that breaks the marriage band
Which stir the fadeless foliage dreamfully ,
Gilding the prairies ere december 's snow ,
Who marshals us our upward way , unsought ;
Verse that your love found fair .
Who gave thee strength , o snowy wave --
That blue-hung room . her perfume comes
Iridescent bubble that the moon tides turn .
Our stately drove we follow .
Idle tongues that would bring down upon him the ban
And rounds of rhyme that shall endure ,
The devil take him for neglecting it !
And here a low , black reef was spread ,
The sunlight falleth down like gold
It lies as plain as yesterday to us .
A wave to pant beneath thy power , and share
Since love follows on knowledge through vision .
In ev'ry hour that passes , o :
Once you have come to forty year .
Be a soul 's voice floating here .
Fainting he fell by grief subdued .
He giveth all to prayer .
He who loved bigness takes a narrow room ,
The creek went down with a broken song ,
Through the wild woods that hung about the town ;
August will come another day .
When the rain descends , decay decays it :
Whose blood shall gain forgiveness for thy past ;
And with the hurt each soldier feels ,
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss ;
Their sweetness , and a dwelling found .
Till the distant mountains answered ,
We are but flowers that blush and blow ,
That won my heart in my greener years .
And for that war prepares , which after ends
That freshness never came again ,
His leisure told him that his time was come .
And my spirit seems to roll
Oft as the pilgrim spirit , most erect ,
And the lamp burned within , a rosy light ,
The stately priory was reared ; [ c ]
While sobs and sighs her utterance broke :
The lark her warbling music lent ,
With rapid force they bear him down the skies
With daily care , and mounted with success ;
And where my country 's flag is flowing ,
As left by the hand of our god .
Respond to freedom 's call . wipe off the stain
The worm drew its links from the turf ;
Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground ?
Styx with her ninefold barrier poured between .
Alone doth give thy children bitter pain .
When the grey dawn broke at last ,
Were now weighed down by sorrow ,
And loses itself in the blue realm of water .
These had seen movement , and heard music ; known
Whose leaves were clouds that caught and lost sunrise ,
Soft steal through the rushes , and comfort find .
Then -- swept beyond recall .
Dew-drops sing to the garden stones ,
The poet wrought a song of sadness , fraught
His nurses to restore to youthful years :
No more of him the story tells ;
Liberal concessions i will make ;
Of charging steeds , careering fast
Close to thy side mine aid will lend .
That her pure spirit shot one sunny glance
But thee the lot of good fortune follows ,
And twitter where the autumn hedges run ,
No shaggy beast that met her in the dark
My master made reply , " to be tormented ;
Hundreds of souls are passing thro ' ,
My youth went down with you to the grave ,
That lay on the madonna 's face where gleamed
Since first fate led me to your kindly door ,
Machinery just meant
And i might waste rich tears upon his fate .
That makes a darkness into order start ,
Such words she o'er her lover pours ,
Years rolled on , but the last one sped --
Precedence slowly claiming and so slowly fixing firm .
And grasses bend beneath the weight they bear ,
So , on they went , a prosperous crew ,
And some unhidden tears that rise
Awful as clouds that nurse the growing storm ;
A title first must draw and interest them ,
" i see all offers made by me how slight
Filling the air with twitterings ,
Little flowers were springing .
Juturna shows a lying sign on high ,
And in your joyous errand reach the spot
When cold winds fly across the air ?
He found all fairer than fair morn
Ring out the false , ring in the true .
As lowly spices gone to sleep ,
In some peculiar note that wrings a tear
And they , her smiles of love caressed ,
High on the wall that holds jerusalem
What restless fever runs in your blood ?
From this day onward , which i feel begun
To picture to the mind -- with melancholy pleasure trace
And our hearts kept time to its music ,
Sprung the fierce strife from what offended power ?
Light over lovers thrown , --
Thy life will rush to his -- the tiny spark
Where nothing comes : but memory ,
A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw ;
Light after light goes out . one evil star ,
His brow is seamed with line and scar ;
Draw vengeance on the ruthless head : --
And bade them make haste and cross the frontier .
Of the day through the deep leaves sifted down .
And make love a burial place .
Pours back the light that thou hast given ,
The sun threw down a radiant spot
Whatever falls . she , with a single word ,
Here comes old shawmut 's pioneer ,
And softest ones that blow ,
They also led me from a virtuous wife ,
Thus you see what a brilliant alliance
His fingers went across it -- all were mute
And gallant death was greatly taken --
On lake and river , the sun lay low
The mournful voice sings on ,
This heart , where peace serenely shines at last .
Some love is found .
I felt my heart with double sorrows prest ,
_ no fame that wit could ever win ; _
“ receive the spoil my fortune well might claim :
Then addressed the words that follow :
Resembling , straightway in its place arose .
And with her burning sighs did melt the ice .
And idiocy doth fight her for thy love ,
One looking on riches may learn some kindred elation ,
The voices of poor children rise ,
The evil hath prevailed . there is no soul alive
That lives in her eye of grey ,
Than ever you found the day .
His funeral-stone with honour she should raise .
Her girlish heart lay at the feet
And the wintry winds are heaping
It said , " this might of vision ?
He shows more appetite for words than war .
No mortal home to them gave birth !
Open , his weary hands stretch idly forth
Love and rejoice and feel and know no more .
I feel thy arms about me ,
Who bore alcides to the thundering god :
There fell a clash , like loosen 'd chain ,
Nor tidings of his son could gain .
For wrathful retribution swiftly comes .
And the good south wind still blew behind ,
With heart never changing and brow never cold ,
Fathoms nine its boughs extended .
Like fainting flowers , their verdure gone .
Whose love for me , by perfect friendship tied ,
How yet the regal aspect he retains !
This punishment is given . ”
In solemn glory shone the snow .
He saw no stay unless he stove
The saddest thought the creature brings ?
He led from africa to swell his power ;
Take care , or the wind will wilt you ,
The charms that caught this soul of mine ,
Whose beauty made the longing city glad .
And on poor christians laid the double charge .
Tearing her hair , aloud proclaims her grief :
She burned and dwindled in her fickle heart ;
Since i have found the secret to be great .
She sighed , then smiled and took the word :
He found it was a useful plan ,
But nature lost the date of this ,
And i knew i had bared his grief :
Wails moaning through the hall ?
First red as roses that on lawn we lay ,
There ráma stood with strength renewed ,
As the holy ruler of heaven had shown him .
It would not make me sleep more peacefully
The world shall resound .
A country 's rights , or freedom to defend
Nature to her glowed ever new-revealed ,
A greater greatness than she e'er hath seen .
My heart made , finding failure in its scope .
But set the snare to make confession mine .
The former amorous flame was quickly turned
His rattling arrows told of his approach .
A presence passed , masked in a sunny ray ,
And as soft waters warble to the moon ,
Not calling in question your baptismal vow ,
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move ;
Comes a pause in the day 's occupations ,
Till winter froze the sweetness of his lips ,
" now i take the tongue of otso ,
Since sorrow never comes too late ,
Where love himself imprison 'd lies ,
The streams of blood about him made a lake ,
Had athens ' town , such joyous feasting seen ;
Abroad did stand the king of the land
The sky with gathering shadow fills .
Beneath our form should every woe sustain ,
Life seemed so wonderful ; it held for me
A promise asked and given warm from the heart ,
Elf-gold that will not stay ;
So , with face lit with delight
And so she lives , and plays her part .
Cupid , whose lamp has lent the ray ,
His precepts teach but what his works inspire .
My death the funeral flood shall pour .
Is read the grief she will not speak ,
For storms to beat on ; the lone agony
When certain valor gained the meed of praise ,
Shall i bring these songs together
Nor whiter than the breast it warms ! "
To make undying music in the world ,
As that which makes the sunlight sweet to me .
A crucifix whereon to register
Thy godhead , show himself thy miracle !
And crash of orbits that diverged ,
The little hands returning wistfully
The ravenous foe , that gorged all human race !
Came floating like a dream , that blessed night
Bright in the leaves that kissed for very joy
Here justice holds us prison 'd , hand and foot
So will the foundations bear the fortress :
But in a narrower ring she makes the race ;
A bold man and a violent , who sets
I felt all strength that love can put in men
Harmless things that hide and peer ,
To turn some changing syllables of praise
His mutilated corse may reach the flame .
All-covering earth shall bury deep in dust !
There is nothing here that speaks of death .
Of far deluging glory , and the air
That has passed over : so this may depart !
But they left us a kingdom none can take ,
To feel the weight of love upon my heart
Either to fear , or follow , or despise
Reaching up to find the light
And held that things were false and true ,
Me to the cloister it shall carry ;
How many were the changes they had brought !
Of souls newly discarnate seeking new life only !
You break , with a rainbow of glory ,
Christine in calm , undreaming slumber lay ,
Thus it was we made our escape !
And neither gives increase , nor brings decay .
Ambrosial fruits fetched from the tree of life ,
That is not paid with moan ,
And value is weighed in the hand !
_ the second edition wherein are added divers
May growing wisdom , mixed with sprightly cheer ,
With light that shines through its transparent walls !
The man hesitated and then relaxed his wooden expression .
So drew he back a little space , and left
Wrecked their homes and swept them downward ,
His goodly spirit should move forth , returning
Which sent the mountain 's ice and snow
One sigh of all the mystery in thee found .
Their faces went away into the dark ,
At first through pity was she drawn to him .
That mystery hid in hues and lines :
Silent she sits beside the blood , nor word
That bring god nearer to a faithless world .
At evening come unto the joys that wait ,
Her sunshine lit thine eyes ;
The ant confront the stars , and every weed
More winters yet to come , or whether he
For through the painter must you see his skill ,
Alleys swept the shining white robe
Thou givest from thy vasty sides forlorn
Slowly , slowly came the grey
Hast held to failing eyes !
For strife and discord through their army flies ,
Begot of freedom , bore our western world :
To stain thee with eternal guilt ,
To ward destruction from the grecian host .
That never rested yet since life began
Prom the dark thickets of the forest broke ,
Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief .
The stars and stripes mean liberty ,
When life has given all she has ,
And earth , in many forms reveal ; and through
While the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky .
If i may gain such favour , as to gaze
Still swallowed up that fiery shower .
Such sweet oaths no sorrow bring
This made my fortunes humorous as wind ,
" this dear support is torn away ,
Filling the air with music wild and sweet .
't was in rome . hard lay the winter
And public faction doubles private hate .
Till usage slowly dulled the edge of dread ,
Which passes through the veins itself to make them .
Suddenly drops the gull and breaks the glassy tide .
For cutting truths have thereby been conveyed ,
Saw the good work of improvement ,
Like the black raven hovering o'er my peace ,
That he make the sun in his course delay ,
Which does mend nature -- change it rather ; but
The ancient rivals bark apart .
But he drank the air as though it held
Now chased , and trembling in ignoble flight :
And night descends upon his solitude .
With pity 's quivering and terror 's chill ,
His pond ' rous whistle from his neck descends ;
Full in sight ran on before him ,
Some truth designed to profit or to please --
That wields it must ere long be dust --
So that it torne into malice ,
He gave the warnin ' ) ,
Between the banks which bear the vine ,
The song encored , the maze pursued ,
Carries its waters swift and clear .
For sheet to hold their bodies warm .
But here they let us stand
Of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses ?
Where love holds perpetual feast .
Saw a chance to keep her promise --
A presence passed , masked in a sunny ray ,
" soon as the twilight tinge is fled ,
With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet .
My love laid on my bosom as i slept !
To ancient hills succeeding , --
No grassy mantle hides the sable hills ,
The darknesses runs consecrated clay .
My stormy spirit will in vapours go !
The ripples glancing to the fervid sun ,
And was wrapped in a funeral pall .
There reigns a curdling monster bold .
Saint gabriel came from god to say ,
The skin , flew to telemachus , embraced
With their foul flavour set the lips awry ;
" my clay with long oblivion is gone dry :
Nor let his heart in sorrow pine :
Let cruel famine prompt the orphan 's prayer ,
And pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain ,
The assurance that you make my bliss ,
Whose sorrow no sunrise might smile away .
Six thousand years in these dull regions pass 'd ,
With bony claws to clutch away his breath !
It grips my throat , it chokes my singing .
Now comes the chill and dusk of night , --
To lessen his grave fault , then made reply :
One dancer left the circling galaxy ,
And so i turned me from the brooding night ;
Again his eyes with fury burned ,
( those which must grow to virtuous deeds ) ,
Pure , ere the world had found them .
Because my heart goes hungry and lone
Sweet spirits wave the airy wand ,
Will feel -- having babes of their own --
Have made us both look deuced glum ,
Speak from a page which made my childhood sigh ,
In which i find myself :
She said ; a rising sigh expressed her woe ,
Of the force he made his own
He felt the veins in his body bloat ,
And we clung to the gates in peril .
Which homer 's finger thrilled along ;
Another sound my spirit hears ,
That looked on many a gay , forgotten guest .
And take in memory of our childhood 's love ,
First the brother silence broke ;
No sooner to my list ' ning ear had come
Because it helps me sympathise
Has by degrees derived from thee great pleasure ,
Tell through thy voice the mysteries to come . "
That ardent spirits burn , for in their pride ,
What roses make by day and night --
Clashing in crowds , each javelin fails to wound .
Of pity and mercy wrought themselves a rod ,
Has gained in heaven a blissful seat . ”
Down lay the wind , and slumbered soon ,
For solitude , when shared with thee ,
What even cromwell spared is desecrated
Love that has given my soul these wings of fire
And turned to scorn , and grown contemptible --
But rocks endure . and england has prevail 'd
Whose eyes are filled with hate , whose teeth
But does the court a worthy man remove ?
There unlocked the massive portals
Where first the stag took water , floated still .
His mind expansive to the object grew .
Abandon fear ; to strength and counsel joined
There lies the book he used to read ,
Which , dyed in many a battle , bore
Where sweet the unbroken moonbeams lay ,
And seeing what great wealth is spread out there ,
Upon the which is every virtue founded ,
A little wistful wind is born .
But in his settled anger bade prepare
Nor long in corruption his body shall lie --
What farther hopes are left thee to pursue ?
The sunlight falls upon a bed of flowers ,
It would not reach , singing the holy smile
And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood .
But faith looks aloft to the skies ;
For they their guilt with weeping will unfold ,
And yearning cries : let come thy kingdom ,
As the midnight stole away .
Volunteered with good humour the dances to cast ;
They come from beds of lichen green ,
Thus said the voice which whispered to his soul :
To find but one word , -- nevermore .
She gives him all things , counting it gain .
Is gone ; our peace , our fearful innocence ,
Who followed him proclaimed , the word of god !
With his mild empire , peace and plenty came ;
Buy while thy purse yet swells with golden youth !
And as the chanting quire their voices raise
Moved from their order they have lost their charm .
The stainers have decreed the stains shall stay .
That only doth with wholy lays inspire ;
Till one soft shower from the south shall bid ,
Our faith was pledged . but vivian would not go
He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away .
For fierce within her , bitter hatred burned ,
Has run , the battle they renew again ,
Take care what you reply to such a letter .
His soul was filled ; yet hoping to regain
In every following satire he has chosen some particular
Less time it took the walls to scale
And friendship may -- perhaps -- be found .
No passport may unbar its sealed frontier , --
From her ( such our resemblance ) can discern .
In pallor on his brow , and made us whisper
The flag that bears the maple-wreath ;
So that their army come upon the foe ,
These humble nuptials to proclaim or grace ?
" shaken with happiness :
Some pang paid down for each new human life ,
That leave their dancing rings to spite the dawn
“ my mother here was made content ;
She lent the fawn her moving , melting gaze ,
And fill your eyes with happy tears .
Bleeding with thorns of petty strife ,
Than sprang those rivals to the forest-gloom ,
" when thunders roar and lightnings flash ,
The pledge which ráma bade me take .
Her sorrows share , and make them less ?
What is it that makes all the flowers die ,
That my high beauty held above
I sought my old home ,
There rise no lilies from the flood ,
And rocked them to an everlasting sleep !
Abroad the blazes sped ;
Seek to put away transgression ,
Life past , life coming , but life now ;
Should see it grace a lovelier maid .
And shaken by each wild surmise
By death alone shall wholly be dispersed ;
" ' taste the food that stands before you :
To those lost pilgrims point the way ,
Sees force take dowerless fraud to wife ,
And each pang cleaves the sympathetic ground !
Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side ,
The sport of coasting was maintained .
Let me on thee my heavy burden cast !
But little joy in life could lion see ,
Than ever beauty lost before ,
Hills flung the cry to hills around ,
For still temptation follows where thou art .
And sculpture rising on the roughened gold ,
The rays can make through boughs spread thickly round ;
“ the prince we hold so dear . ”
With their rich belts their captive arms restrains
And it turned to a sonnet .
With plenty of toys that will make a noise ,
To fill the swelling veins for thee , and now
Laden with horror all too great to bear ,
" and loosed the sun upon his blazing way
To make your merry blood run slow !
A vile conceit in pompous words expressed ,
Pray , tell me where your roses blow !
That moulded them , the high and infinite will
Had sown the name at which we sneered ,
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it .
Graceless they are when gone to frivolousness ,
Their purpose ; but no ear they lend .
Here commerce only takes her stand ,
Were run on like economy , a year
Where ideals float like clouds , we owed to france
The strain with rapture that with fire was penned .
Her brightening interest rested on the child .
No word was left unsaid , no act undone ,
Those five small ships lay silent in the gloom
Felt in his heart a strange wish for exploring
And dark or bright , those souls must tread
I think because more with its truth imbued .
By chill november , late i strayed ,
There are some might be found entertaining a notion ,
Would i be counted kind ;
Where the dove resting hid the thorns of fame .
The hour wears late , the wind feels cold ,
How the sad thoughts slip back across the night :
That hides his murmurs in the rose , --
In closer war reverseless ; and would set
To blow a blast of shattering power ,
Where milton longed to spend his age .
Gave it a softness nature had not given ,
Equals himself , nor sinks he to the shades .
Answered in the words which follow :
My shoulders bowed with weariness unguessed ;
The dawn is smiling on the dew that covers
To set down in his favor .
And my kisses shall teach thy lips
In which not envy 's self a flaw discovers ;
For thick and fast as snowflakes poured from heaven
He carried anger as a flint bears fire ;
Their sundered atoms float about the world ,
It gives a chap the belly-ache .
Presto ! number four they haul !
't was open field and running flood --
And every revolution made them fairer .
Which comes , with healing on its wings ,
This awful wickedness has wrought ,
To feel that sweet scorn of all good
While floating odors round me swim ,
Did make provision , thorough grace alone ,
Until thine hour comes . immortal flower thou art !
Till the tears fill both his eyes ! '
Still fixed on marmion was his look ,
From the strife the western god regards as gain .
Days come and go , and still we write ,
Where nob put will of force or fraud ;
That made the blossom and the bird ?
And fields and forests rush into the deep ;
Dim as yon taper 's sullen flame ,
Thy life to thy neighbor 's creed has lent .
He dropped his pen in homage to the truth .
Could make of union
And he spoke the words which follow :
The scourge evoked as it rose and fell .
That will not open to the keys of speech .
That his wife was charged to kill his brother .
And the men who made them famous ,
As old time makes these decay ,
And faced its terrors each and all .
Many suns i waited in hunger and spirit searching ;
Rolling on the platform left me ,
Freshening and making green the dimmest nooks
Set the clouds on fire with redness ,
Then reach my bliss ,
The heart may ache , but may not burst ;
While lost in mist , the present fades away .
In words thy faith may stand unshaken ,
While thus the god the martial fire awakes :
Ye gave it falsehoods for its truth ,
Before i gave thee pain , my heart has need
And undissembled gore pursued the wound .
As the necessities their authors feel ;
Then come misfortune , i bid thee welcome ,
His hand the monarch sudden took ;
But in the silence came a voice to me ;
And with the forward ones his arms it seized ;
For when the soul is laboring in despair ,
Above the wave rose many a moorish head ,
I can show a clear conscience .
Had into such danger plunged . "
( to take your own case )
But another remains that is harder to spell ;
To gossip never do their tongues feel tired .
Thus by pothinus was to caesar given .
Whereby man may conquer nature .
Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew ,
O'er corpses moved the fearful dance
In came the moon and covered me with wonder ,
These would we for labours take ,
Unto that august tribunal comes a gentleman in grief ,
Thus his aged wife makes answer ;
And send down heavenly peace on those who mate ,
The self-same spot sought idly . there ,
Mutely sat the aged monarch
And the sunshine smiled at me ,
And yet the gift i give is good :
The tither stooked raw ,
Into the fowler 's net hath made him soar ;
Their joys are ill contained within their breast .
Those services which intervene }
And laughing at the leaves that float
Menai reflects the prophet hues , and far
I held as one who goeth reverently .
Stern reason is to judgment come ,
To gain the secret of the awful world ,
That never till this moment we felt true bitterness ,
Till such a lyric breath intone ?
In honest works to lead the van ,
The soul of brotherhood whence reverence drew .
But the fir-tree held and warned me :
Live like the gorgeous western light that shone
To ask a dole of fate ;
And put upon the day a deathless crown .
To set it nigh spinning , these two
Be tasted ere it work ; the last exceeding
And all her nymphs took varying shapes in glee ,
Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze .
The less my sighs and tears prevail .
The busy breeze came up the hill
And cast the dark foundations deep ,
He builds my life ;
To join my fellows , battle once again ,
The master of the rite addressed :
No love i knew but what might pass away
When front to front those noble armies met ,
And for each man a mission makes , --
The voice that speaks is the voice of god ,
The wild flowers wave and toss ;
Which prompted horrors not to be expressed :
Like this our world which vasty ether holds
And boil it to cover expenses ;
Which spurning contempt shall redeem from his ire .
Certain " talented " echoes there dwell ,
That crowned that airy solitude ,
And seas retreating leave their fishes bare ,
The limits of his art appear .
To such i render more than mere respect ,
And the scene is tinged with a quiet melancholy ,
For wrongs which wearied patience bore ,
Now the period of time had come when abraham
That lay in the house that jack built .
Canst thou not recall my counsels ?
These voices intertwined like woven flowers ,
What means thy melancholy note ? --
Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes , that stood
She would turn a new side to her mortal ,
Worth being rich to hold in fee .
Sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow .
Saw an old oak just trembling to its fall ,
And then his only garment quite gave way ;
To wring from out thy soul a cry
Unless his noisy tongue can only fight ,
The virtues that in thee are found .
And step for step they followed dancing ,
My precious wee bit things bear freight ;
Crying aloud in thine ears fast sealed ,
And my chief cures which make a stir , --
Present to grasp , and future still to find ,
But nearer footsteps drew , then seemed to wait :
Of gloom and terror gathering round the mind .
Tuonetar makes this answer :
Once more my heart goes up to thee ,
I never hop 'd a secret flight from hence ,
In the very words which follow :
Never was blast from vapour charged with cold ,
She could -- she gave her secret sorrow vent ,
That made us , and for us this ample world
For none the more his restlessness was spent .
Of chastity , and bears it evermore
Wherein some dreadful drink seethed up .
And how a curse may turn into a prayer .
And drove from earth the demon of despair .
New houses in the streets shall rise
Is filled with sound , and launched in time ,
Have sought it oft , where it should lie ;
It goes through many things and leaves them whole ,
By falsities and lies the greatest part
He took advantage of his strength to be
Before the torturers their lust had fed !
“ a crow which bore a dead man ’s leg
Take special care ; for ajax ' years not much
Then by sorrow deeply touched
Is centre , yet extends to all , so thou
Braving each foe , escaping every snare .
Without , the raging tempest still assailed ;
And into small sad fields descend
And i can not carry this battle :
Deep silence fell ; before the immortal throne
If ever a joy be found herein ,
And now the goal is gained , they bind
I still may shed the bitter , hopeless tear ,
There stood the goddess , and in accents loud
They rush through the twilight sweet ,
Last came the glorious powers in league with troy
The moss reprints more tenderly
Of choking sorrow underground .
Then burst the cavalry with heroic speed ,
Sage counsel give , and well in season speak .
And thus his tidings to the master brought :
How can these two come face to face ,
Place of honour kept for strangers .
Who drive men of weak will into sexual crimes .
The door was shut , the latch made fast .
The broken moon lay in the autumn sky ,
I can hear their voices calling ,
In his heart had made him a song ,
Where envy comes to fret a body ?
As he makes those famous flights
Thy thirst , which from the triple question rose .
And passing proud a little color makes thee .
Since she had spent her girlhood , womanhood
As i proceed with my unvarnished tale .
Until we come to that first cause of all ,
For a life that knows no fear !
And overhead the moon uplifts her horn ,
So dusk would come and mingle lake and shore ,
That wears a cloud amid its joy .
Nature demanding recompense for hours
The magic cup that fill 'd itself anew .
Place near him , as ye lay him low ,
Which oft ' has stood the battle 's shock ,
Watching all things " lie down to sleep . "
Much virtue was found to reside in his thumbs :
The secrets of eternity now lay
So unto you does this , my work belong .
With all that here makes mortals bless 'd ;
The light of joyful hope i trace .
Held undisputed sway .
Though sunk in death the forms the poet drew ,
And this same flower that smiles to-day ,
Then through the open door the old year passed
It well may fill his lordship with vexation ,
As good geneura 's absence made me bold ;
To quarrel and make such a noise !
The tears that vainly fall ,
And allevod is the name he bears ;
One the shutters drew --
" life counts not hours by joy or pangs ,
Came sweeping on the storm of battle , fierce ,
His scepter shows the force of temporal power ,
With anguish 'd face and flying hair
That comes with morning from the sun to be
To dear-bought wisdom give the credit due ,
To the net there went the women ,
The monstrous armaments of spain could move
Like envy 's , issued from that cloud :
And he spoke the words which follow :
And so i flashed and snapped in my own fires
In open converse , bringing forth its best :
Consider , jehane , which to take
Bewildered left the glorious skies
" give the word ! " but no such word
To note the fighting conflict of her hue ,
She never flinched ; she faced her doom :
The wild thrush lifts a note of mirth ;
Can not touch the notes of concord !
The mystery 's solution ; then he took ,
Plunged it to blackness and doom .
That lined the orient skies beneath one star !
Now every day thy love i meet ,
And fools if given no name but foolishness .
Twined with my very heart he grew ;
" till once more the people rise ,
And round about it ran a clear blue stream ,
Which is so great that there i go
So lilith backward turned to holier days ,
Beat with another , answering love for love ,
My mother took the veil of christ -- the hours
As the moon keeps its own dear light .
Corruption came not in each mind to kill
Taintless of tyranny , stands
Duly had flames of worship blazed
These emblems to the life shall stand
Our hearts shall breathe the old refrain ,
Where lyric comedy is played ;
Hover 'd around her loss , all burying deep
A softer name the saxons gave ,
For his revolt -- yet faithful how they stood ,
With soft voice bharat made reply :
What merit or what grace to me reveals thee ?
Sharp questions blunted by such bold reply .
And every revolution made them fairer .
At once extend the interest and the love ;
There did i see our conquered fathers fall ,
And feel that i may never live to trace
Love came back at fall o ' dew ,
But though her tears stood watering in her eye ,
We found our faith was glorified .
Thickening with storm , the wintry clouds will loom ,
And solemn jaws now stirred , and merlin smiled
Around me flows thy quickening life ,
Of beauty there , whose freshness never dies ,
For this he shares a felon 's cell ,
That as they gallop 'd made the echoes roar ;
I draw a darker scene , replete with gloom ,
Of every silver ripple meet the trees
Or the love that came with the helpless one ;
For lo , their doom is sealed !
Fame says he is an odd and curious wight ,
Which helped the shoe-man make his haul .
Not fit to come to his degree ;
Duration gives importance ; swells the price
That made me is the heart within my heart ,
( few moons have faded since the solemn vow )
There the noble travellers that night their lodging made .
She 'd make the very devil marry her .
Where hostile millions sought my single life ;
I resolutely shut away the past ,
For it has found the track of destiny .
Gentle birds leap upon the hill ,
In frails of wicker bore the luscious fruit ,
That sorrow leaves behind .
Stealth 's own self could not take more care .
This order 'd ring and harmony of man ,
A god might gaze and tremble at the sight
But ere the motor went aboard
He shined in writing , and his wit displayed --
Nor shame nor scandal now the queen restrain ,
For he caught a glimpse of an aged crone
And my weary eyes turn there
And filling each man 's heart with laughter --
At the same time you ca n't deny it makes
So my heart falls with a moan
Though these , their life completed , follow thee ;
Oft in the dead of night loud winds rise ,
Dared these lips my sad story impart ,
Neither in june shall we stay the eternal flow
Where sunsets never come , there 's aught
And snow that often blinds the traveller 's course ,
Came as silent as the dew comes ,
But left more sweet than roses to respire ,
The idle clouds go floating by ;
I feel a firmer trust -- a higher hope
In my breast no echoes now arise ,
You 'll wildly chase your dreams about .
For the high providence , which had ordained
To melt into each other and shape themselves
My passionate prayer such influence possessed .
The mask is off -- the charm is wrought --
The blossoms , they make no delay :
But nought o'er the wintry plain had passed
Away from you i can make up my mind
Best lay the rhyme , best lead the dance ,
My heart shoots into the breast of the bird ,
It stands upon my honour
With old emotions weeping silently .
My threatened fate , it chilled my blood ,
To deal with witches this is still the way .
Catch the gleam of sunny hair .
To simulate a freedom they feel not ;
What nations followed , and what chiefs command ;
No longer joys to set the eyes aglow ;
Thy message given , thine home in sight ,
That did the deed that folly planned ;
A golden river flashing ' neath the sun ,
Strange vigor comes , she is restored to health .
Will gain a wife with half as many more ,
And loving arms about him wound ,
Lo , the dead shall rise to heaven !
Tears that would melt the hardest stone ,
Stars lost in night-eternity to throng
Into their guidance gave her ; loth she went
It feels forever without end ,
But never have sought nor sighed for change ;
When the storm has ceased to blow , --
O’er all of us thy rule extend ,
When nothing that asks for bliss ,
Yet terror flies with joy before thy feet ,
Sumantra loosed each weary steed .
The longing thirst for action then awoke , --
Forth from her sacred eye-lids sent ,
Still it whisper 'd promised pleasure ,
On fallen leaves that stirred and rustled chill ,
Though never by the breath of kisses fanned ;
And the spring wind all dispersed them .
And unto him it was surely given .
The rushes cried _ abide , abide _ ,
And sport they find which brings delight --
This flattery , fail his ruthless hand to stay .
Yes , pondering on her fate , i see
His fatherly pity bends in tears dismay 'd .
Already the slim crocus stirs the snow ,
A cloud of fire his lifted nostrils raise ,
Sing of glories gone : -
And though thy feet through shadowy paths may grope ,
But you who seek to give and merit fame ,
Brave the dividing seas to join the war ?
Choice of the nymphs whose looks will slant
That cooled his misery , and then he asked
Within it , and without it sees
She felt , and expected to die .
He cast a saddened look around ;
With thee the evil , or with thee to share
Who gives the quivering nerve its sense of pain ;
No end of nice people i see ;
The yellow leaves begin to fade
The walls neatly mended , the parlour swept clean ,
Still , when life has long departed ,
Yet can not guard himself from treachery .
Brought the bridal guests , to lead the maiden
Thou art not fit to hear thyself convinced .
Shalt find acceptance , for a while suspend
And so the soul drifts out and o'er
Till there lifts the glow of a tiny spark --
That held me as sweet language holds ;
Whose notes like circling swallows fly ;
For until now my thought flowed on ,
Sweet faces turn their beaming eyes on mine ;
The wind hath blown a gale all day ,
And ask forgiveness , peace and rest .
Night shadows descended ; it snowed from the north ;
Their hearts went up with pure desire ,
Than the wealth thou hast discovered .
In pangs , and nature gave a second groan ,
There might still misfortune find thee ,
The shattered branches sweeps in hurricane ;
Apart , intrinsic , stand ,
All day he drank her splendid light of eyes ;
By which her love for me was shown ,
The aged priam , trembling with affright ,
They hang heavy , bursting with juice ,
Though changing clouds lose her resemblance ,
Leave remorse to warm his hands
So 's they 'll first take on his gills .
But in his chapel vile the image laid ,
Fierce as grim death one hand he laid
Had spun a silvery web of mist ,
It _ nearly _ makes me cry
That follows faithful service as its fruit ,
Thro ' milan and that land which gave
Not less the grace she wished he wrought .
Truth is deposited with man 's last hour ;
Making a joy of sorrows that are brief ,
Might raise the dead , the living slay ,
The woodland lays around the farm ,
That felt the besom of the dead ,
They soon made their way to the gardens attached
Has a change come over my vision ?
To make a seizure on the light ,
The ideal life free thought can give ;
An ' the best we may go wrong ,
That took the blow like steel into his heart .
As if the wind could stand north-south ;
To take a wife it is a glorious thing ;
And worn with famine , long and ceaseless hiss ,
Songs flush with purple bloom the rye ,
Through a circle that ever returneth in
Then , even as from destruction shrank the lads ,
Of human things ; a mingled work we draw ,
Chose that your steadfast soul should fly
Yea ! out of winter 's flying sleet
He learned at last how bitterly love hurts ;
That , crossed by shades and sunny gleams ,
He eased at once his pain , the sable blood
But i ca n't leave the child alone . "
But sure no cloven foot i see .
Studious to save what human wants require ,
Where ugly fiends and damned spirits sit ;
No word they utter 'd , no enquiry made .
Antilochus , nor dubious left the prize .
Our restless , wandering thoughts to turn away
The late-relenting gods with victory brought
To catch the rippling rain , --
The world does but exist that welfare to bestow .
To fiercer , weightier battles give expression .
And all alone went she .
That kept my pen from spending on slight ware ,
The living silver rolls its ponderous waves ;
Life makes the soul dependent on the dust ;
Its chimney shows one angle
Heir of high bliss , my choice is made ,
And oft replaced their squandered treasures are .
It gives relief from much solicitude
As in the summers that are gone .
With hollow screeches fled the dire repast ;
And grief , too , held her vigil there ;
But soon he found , enquiry made ,
That piecemeal lay his armour scattered ;
" and the tale is yet to run :
" wouldst know the blight it leaves behind ?
Maiden , an oak that soars on high ,
" the bond to which its seal is set ,
First made my rusty heart rejoice
Still did the garden shed its odorous boon
With staring eyes still fixed upon the thing .
Where the woods drooped low and the river rolled .
So little such oaths mean .
The weapons forged against his country 's peace
But his faith no years could bend ,
Take my advice , let reason bear her sway ,
And turn his thoughts with sighs of regret
The vestiges of feudal wrongs shall lie
There crept a garden of enchantment , height
Of other days , dim pictures passed ; of wood
His feet to follow where it fled ,
O'er the gleaming pebbles in ripples run !
From realms above , his stubborn heart to bend ?
That ever made infection of man 's earth ;
Reserve will wound it ; and distrust , destroy .
Where never wing of angell yet made way :
I know the seasons glide away ,
Unmindful whence his fortune came ,
My filial song i weave with theirs who roll
His eyes with flames of fury burned .
God so admits it , sends it forth
I knew that he nursed a malice accurst ,
Where the widow give the party .
Fierce memory of his wrongs awoke against
With all perfections , so enflame my sense
The broom 's tough roots his ladder made ,
And all thy dear tones pass away ,
It makes you heave a sigh or two
The sinner , startled by his ways of awe :
Which puts my pegasus to these grave paces .
Whether drawing strains of music ,
Men whose hearts would flow together ,
Though self-possession may that fear conceal .
This that is left belongs to sleep .
And my heart it stounds wi ' anguish ,
There to his children his commands be given ,
And distant rumblings fell upon the ear ;
To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear ,
How was it that ambition crept ,
Their lilies fair they raise on high ;
The lights on brimming crystal fell ,
They dreamt of fame and pondered
The systems formed by heavenly love
Whose violence takes edge off from delight .
And the snow has left the moss ;
Hath left in shadows dread ,
A sign upon the door she drew ;
How will our fathers rise up in a rage ,
All felt a pleasure to obey ;
Whose voice made my song complete ,
Which tells not of december 's cold ,
Fate cut her threads and formed anew
At the hour of its leaving earth .
He looks at as merely ideas ; in short ,
The dawn that finds , beneath my head ,
Where greater spirits come .
No erring course would he pursue .
For bacchus there with tenfold rage pursued
He 'll wrong us till he gets a blow
To touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood .
To lie in state , while angels wait
And will and aspirations linked with god ?
The buds gone on to blow ,
That time is past , your race is run ,
The story-sculptured gothic porch lay dim
I arrested the vapours that floated by ,
To clear those junkers out of parliament .
But oh ! the autumn-time will come ,
He went as one that fell ;
" all men made wise through midnight sable
As all their souls in blissful rapture took :
The memory of his paleness made them cower .
It only loved to be there .
So the tyrant count they took ,
Will there give your heart a twirl
Unless thy law within the heart be fixed .
Tears fill 'd her eyes ; her intercepted voice
I with that heavy-laden soul went on ,
To light our way and bring us nearer god .
As flakes of snow stood yesterday ,
I have sealed the scroll of my command .
Life and death have come and gone !
Half is mine , although i follow ;
A martyr 's death is fixed for thee .
While reason sits on its throne and nods .
In grey half-light shot through and through
And in the squares where fountains played ,
The youth , his rising sorrow to assuage ,
Whose fame through all the regions rang .
Things go not wrong when sudden i fall prone ,
Is poured a flood of light ,
Beyond the sunset lying low ,
It flew to be wedded , to wed
Wealth makes burdens , pleasure stings ,
When the stars threw down their spears ,
The colt will take lots of choking ;
Bearing a fifth within your regal train ,
Still , homeward bound , i tarry ,
Thou stand ' st as heaven 's defence divine ,
For the star of his race was set .
On which fantastic shadows play ;
How matters go , in this our day ,
Unwilling tears could summon ,
More fearful rose the storm ; the east wind sang
You stuck to us closer than nighest of kin
And the flames spread forth a fairy fire ,
In you no vanity could thence be shown ,
A tower is seated in the vale below .
And with more boldness prest her former suit .
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
To guide , philosopher , and friend ;
But soon there rose a galling shout
Not tire , demanding rather skill than force .
The sunrise shook from fold ,
A fever , gathering head with fiery heat ,
In love and peace shall arise .
And we have made the sun black with despair ,
And waited for the dead to come to life ;
To tear his country , and his kind destroy !
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
My public armies , feed his private foes ,
Still this proud title it may fairly claim ;
And sorrow 's shafts fly thicker ,
I would the homely truth proclaim --
Till from each shuddering wound the red joy flowed ;
True to his promise made to thee :
She has desires of touch , as if to feel
This soften and refine the soul for heaven .
But the sun will suffer no white ,
All those wiles she wound about me ,
Or , dozing , strike the seasons cold .
Than that which sad misfortune this day asks :
Swathed in his beard of flashing sleet ,
Here poor integrity can sit at ease ,
To him the king high honour showed ,
With waving arm the billowy tumult quell 'd ,
And yet the flag he lifted to the wind
To leave this venture to the lesser man .
If wiser thou with us thy powers employ ,
Sweet garlands that my hands had twined ?
Whence tyber first unlocks his mighty flood . "
Before the twice-born priests were laid ,
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
And then descending met them at the gates ,
That tells when love is grown old ,
That 's come to beg your charity ;
He said the law gave me nothing ,
Somewhat of manners saw , and men ;
Through human hearts , by love of him controlled ,
And sunk the victim of all-conquering death .
“ the melancholy funeral pomp she led ,
On truth the words of god are based :
But he to self-destruction blindly spurred .
For bounce went the door ,
Like man intelligent , they plough the tides ,
Then urge the steed , the chorus join ,
Then , as the waters rose and swelled ,
With answering thunders fill ’d the echoing plain ;
Then there arose a mightier dance ,
And oaths of amity shall bind the rest .
And , parting , leave a loathsome stench behind .
I may have run the glorious race ,
And hides no aim or purpose in his heart
Make such another sweet comparison .
To voice the life within him , and he wonders
Peace that should claim respect from lawless might .
Ere semele can bend the angry gods .
There no father 's welcome meet them .
And still , as love 's brief morning wore ,
Had reached the restful shore .
With a love which made him noble ;
Rome for her guilt pay the atonement due .
In grief which they alone can feel
A wind came up out of the sea ,
Oh the sad change that fortune brings !
Washes the horror of his mouth .
Would find fulfilment ; and the curse of cain
And led their disciples astray ;
And full in his eye madness sat ;
And carried weighty sorrows in thy stead ;
What best may for the present serve to hide
The ground all heaved in waves of fire that surged
The song that smiled upon his birthday here
Where the wild bee holds her sweets , --
In all thy maiden steadfastness arise ,
Yet all i bore seemed more than i could bear
It shall sit upon a throne !
Such notes of wail rose welling
That lovely spirits gather from distress .
Who sits a new king on the absolute throne ?
Which she stole from her bright-flaming fire ,
When greece came hither , i had fifty sons ;
If to my inmost heart the arrow goes ,
Pricked onward , bound for their unsung romance .
The pangs to both lives that belong ;
And feed my eyes , hungry with sorrow ,
The net and angle various hands employ ,
Hastens as the dawn is breaking ,
On the latch he laid his fingers ,
Yet still entire the abbey stood ,
Doth every beast keep holiday .
And pass the dangers all i have foretold ,
Music is passing far off :
Turbid and thick its waters lie ,
His guilty checks , down went his eyesight mild .
When you had played with life a space
And to follow the star wherever it went .
That come with requests from the country all round ;
I feel , though thou art distant far ,
Rain that lifts and rain that moves away ;
Even to change the bitterness of it ,
Ye wake to feel your beauty going .
The world must fall if she must bleed ; --
Most childish children earth has borne . '
To brave the wintry breeze .
His time was come : he ran his race ;
And when men win thy meaning with much pain ,
But when the evening introduces the night ,
Death hath but little left him to destroy !
Such fulness of delight the list ' ner feels .
For seeing the traits of the priest there revealed ,
What looms in the west released ?
To see what comfort it would yield ;
That flickered in a rosy , silken snow
Thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew ;
In gay profusion they shall spread
Think what it means to see the dawn !
Allow 'd his body to receive a wound .
Had fallen . misery encompassed all ;
Upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel . '
Triumph and hope shall lead him by the palm :
Then , on the height , comes the storm .
The way the stairs creaked made you wonder
It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice ,
All gloomy as the hour , around him stand ,
I pause a moment here to bend and muse ,
The laws of physics teach -- "
I associated strongly with those happier august days ;
And his wishes served to guide him ;
His glorious standard to the wind he spread ,
Hath flattering words to move her
Till sated pleasure sank to pain .
Which various symptoms have made known ,
An inauspicious throb that dealt
As blue eyes gazed in eyes of brown ,
The lonely beauty shines alone for him .
In nature 's order as they pass 'd along :
The clock struck one ,
As quick a growth to meet decay ,
Whatever charms the soul , and keeps it true .
Beside the fearful truths thou couldst reveal ?
And every wound the tortured bosom feels ,
Unearthly was the hymn , which then arose .
My fire is dead : it knew no pain ;
Of heaven slowly climbed . the gray sea grew
Upon the wall in colors blazed ;
Love laid his sleepless head
But in the smoke that drifted on the green
The curse is gone , the bond are free --
And their valiant deeds and blood shall wash the stain
Answered in the words which follow :
Of past joys , now turned to pain ;
With all submission it was met . }
Let hope serve at such a nede :
Its consecration unto freedom 's god !
And throw on poverty his cruel eyes ;
An ' the snow lay so thick
He sees dissolving all that 's made .
And all that did then attend and follow ,
To vanquish paris , and would bear me home
While my poor heart with love is burning .
He poured his soul into their chimes ,
To meet misfortune 's , where it blends ,
By pressing youth attacked on ev'ry side :
Rebellion hath broken up house ,
That turns instinctively to light -- green worms
And each good subject lies dissolved in tears !
From the fair form exhaled and shed ,
To pour forth their tune-footed throngs ;
One word of love upon me fell ;
Look farther , the command stands quite reversed ,
And pleasure , sapping , seemed to fill .
And freedom with the soil they gave .
Our triumph now , the mighty warrior lies ! "
Or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes ;
Were odious , and , with indignation fired ,
Little lips that appeal
I fain would go to rest ,
The music carried on by itself a while .
As onward still its course doth go .
The wind hath blown a gale all day ;
I woke with lips made quiet by a kiss .
So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith :
I reached the portal common spirits fear ,
Swift succour to the dame would lend .
In came germand gladenswayne ,
“ my passion wilder far than hers appears .
And her winter sleep drew near .
As something precious , hidden in your heart ,
They flash again their laughter , pink and yellow ,
Who won imposing fame with sword or pen ?
The tale relate , in aid of holy writ ;
There he bears a frightful uproar ,
Beneath the daisies , there they lie !
The pace that he went brought strain to breath ,
To try their force , which most men find ,
Across the web of many memories came .
Nor lose my mirth , nor feel a stain ;
No winter lies between us and that day .
Yet love but drew the summer clouds away
In gentle showers the rain descends ,
The heart , whose hopes could make it
He struck in prelude to his pleasant strains ,
This shaft the whirling clouds could meet ,
It is not shaken by thy threats .
Thro ' seas where sail was never spread before ,
Not knowing they had left him to his doom ,
And thus in turn his answer made :
You should not find a line drawn wrong ,
Of coming kisses fanned by playful dreams .
Will bring a time we shall not know ,
Interesting fragment , found among the papers of count
Winter would be known by his cold cutting snow
That through the streets they bore our saviour christ
Of hopes misborn and fading not to rest !
And strove her love and hot desire to cover ,
Long left the limits of all love , --
Embracing , which had held a soul so brave ,
And from the threshold pour the mournful strain :
But they that cast her spirit into flesh ,
Nor dreamed thy love would knock for years ,
The iron tempest hurtles in the air ,
But her cheeks grew pallid when , lashing through
Which bade the series of events extend
She takes the breath of men away
Grows dense with boughs that cling . ”
The greatest , thou . how dreadful to reflect ,
That many times i to return had turned .
When sad trials called it forth .
As the glad news her trusting heart beguiled .
And with his blessing freed the land .
Where , with religious their common gods they place .
He takes all shapes that serve his black designs :
Wells of her eyes reflected stars ...
Yet all her sorrows turn not hector ’s heart .
The palace roof that guards a crown ,
Glowing blue snows cast a howling darkness .
Thought sits alone and gazes with rapt gaze ,
Dull and low his fire was burning ,
Faint light by chequered lives is shown ;
How it gushes and struggles out
Her face transfigured shone , and half apart
Admir 'd the fortune of the rising town ,
On all sides doubts and terrors met her ;
Should fix my fortune in some meaner state ,
His laugh has caught a clearer ring ;
And truth shall own , some virtues they possess :
The abbess of saint hilda placed ,
Our fancies hang gray and uncurled
This man , whose bearing would command respect ,
But rollant felt that death had made a way
And draws the horizons unto him .
Will come pursuing marriages
The fugitive from pangs that rack and tear ;
So , though some shade of awe doth stir
Thitherward my heart is turning .
Like his have worse or better , enoch saw .
There sits quiescent on the floods , that show
The sun lay west
And cast bright looks on everything .
And has filled with its freshness and sweetness
Then swift remembrance flushed her virgin snow ,
For the preacher -- love -- we bring
As fair as she for whom the trojan went ,
Pressed the iron of the prison , smote the fiery
And that leaves no smart ,
Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness .
A witness may be brought to swear a lie ,
He sought his heavenly residence
For resignation god hath given as dower ?
And made him this most tart reply --
Then upon charles a heavy sorrow weighed ,
Of trees that quietly aspire on high ;
Rain stilled , leaves flame-wet , and hush
That makes my heart-throb seem divine .
And think it summer that rewinded hath ,
" this new adventurer gives :
Back the world slips , love !
And the sharp steel his blood profusely drew ;
Where the heart of a hero lies low .
With orient colours waving : with them rose
At passion 's glowing touch , the senses melt .
That ever fired the poet 's soul , or drew
Long in these climes thy memory shall remain ,
That led from her room to the garden .
And made the subject of a jest .
That rocket , dread , went tearing
Then round about the grave old men they drew ,
The curling clouds of day .
If e'er its justice wraps in flame
Took up the gauntlet life had thrown ,
Till they bring forth the fruitful progeny ;
So went the pilgrim still ,
Was filled with magic , and the ear
As the dew passes from the flowering thorn ;
A million buds but stay their blossoming ;
But to permit their sally deems not meet .
In the same this heart shall burn .
Strength to the drop and firm endurance gave .
My beauty , which the loftier it climbs ,
Less doubtful , as that worthy shade complied .
Ranged with the table round that held the lists ,
And we departing left them to that broil .
The nymph finds a relief for all her pains ,
Where tufted trees a native arbor made .
The ballet she led ;
His spirit retains unbroken , and his limbs
O eyes , that never once were raised !
Which marred his borrowed visage , and betrayed
And thirty thousand seasons reigned .
Tried to catch the fire-intruder ,
How deep the pain from which we borrow , --
Chaining all the past , exacting
That a downfall soon must come to pass .
And found both time to preach and pray .
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain . "
Love that beyond itself can see
Whence then came her eyes of fury ?
But the moment she felt ill , and before you
And breathes a browner horror on the woods .
In passion 's hope absorbed , content .
Gay , verdant scenes that nature drew
To certain hints ned gave the tsar --
The odorous alleys softly blew .
It mingled strangely with my fears ,
That i should give belief !
And all his hatred very soon disarms .
Holds its breath ,
The fearful risk by richardetto run
The world hath accepted its pain ;
Dies out , and leaves the summer bare .
If chairs have but feeling in holding such charms ,
But freedom 's cottage soon was thrust aside
While countless generations pass away .
Deep shadows hide you wholly from our sight ;
In sancho 's cause the gallant navy joins ,
Now in mute stillness rested all the air :
These broken arches have taught generations to build .
Of sleep that in my memory strives again :
In which the power of satan broken is :
No one came to give him greeting ,
With eyes that shone with trembling glow ,
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran ,
But little now remains for us to note ,
In eyes whose sadness seemed to lean
Both gods and goddesses , your strength , apply :
Must it not lie -- how many fathom deep --
And desolations , wrought
Whatever comes with years .
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear .
The mavis sang , while dew-drops hang
The death-change here receiving :
Breaking the silence of their gloomy home :
Thy spotless muse , like mary , did contain
And day has set in the great woods ,
Whereout the demon issued up from hell .
Made piercing sharp by sorrow cleave the clay
Where the dim forest lies ,
Hearkening the sighing restless wind go by .
Darted their tongues of terror , and rolled out
The tears wherewith mine eyelids ran
To put to rout each tender sentiment .
They know where the storms are made :
He matched with gaiety inexhaustible ;
And left a curse upon the place .
For we help him make things grow ,
The joy that lives at heart and home ,
And in their dear petitions place him :
Westward it winds past each town ,
It crept , tear-spattered , into song ,
And gets an act of parliament to rob ;
They who pushed back the ocean of the unknown ,
Now tempting me , to drown myself in tears ,
There 's many a bird makes no such haste ,
From dirt and seaweed as proud venice rose ;
And all my vintage drips in a cocoon .
That made the wind to blow ! '
Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes
From flower to flower it springs .
His eyes with burning wrath aglow ,
That goes the way that it lays ;
May not endure till time can bring them ease .
With speaking tears , that ask him why
Bring home the triumph of our victory :
If at pure peace and happiness we aim ,
It flew , yet breathed aloof
And features lifts divine , though all be fair ,
Nor loving-kindness helped to show thee
Which made thee all that nature meant thee !
My cocoon tightens , colors tease ,
't is an outfit meant for pleasure ;
With love whose race is run ?
The dragon brings all powers the dragon hath :
But now , his radiant course is run ,
And lead our hearts to mercy and its god .
And brought the heavenly arms which lay
That faced my three-plank bed ,
On thy breath their fragrance borne .
Meantime all forward drew : me terror seiz 'd
Whose social souls the goblet blends ;
That brought me in to thee ,
That pressed it long ago .
As our actions make them so . "
There came a sound from the wood ,
My heart flies on before me as i sail ;
Gathering all its fire ,
But age will own the bitter truth ,
When forth the world ’s great ruler went .
The autumn " lan " already houses the dew .
Giving praise where none hath sinned . --
The liquor spent , they to dancing went ,
To save the athenian walls from ruin bare .
Under them still the silver fishes stood ;
That holds my soul and body in its mesh ;
Her color comes and goes ;
Is not the faith sent from above :
Which to devotion pure its aid doth lend ;
Moses ! what a jump he gave .
No air his arms can gather ; loud he calls
Now tells the hour of noon ?
Which a french army suffered from their rage ,
Shall make a new zodiac , guiding the wise ,
The rest might in love disappear .
The flowery meadows sparkled all aglow
The master-piece to which he shaped it .
Of powers and pleasures ? let it try .
No thought of evil dare come nigh to thee ,
To him whose hate no doom can turn ,
Among the learned of our age to shine ,
The voiceless darkness which the daylight took .
Scorching lay the heat of summer
Suns may shine , or the rains beat chill ,
Proudly , our banner stands .
So like the past it flows .
The morning came above the serried coast ,
Then there came a day
The violet hills are lost in gloom .
A sapphire light fell on them ,
How lonely all the years will run
The hurricane arose in wrath ,
Can ever quench its own celestial fire .
Blanched ever more and more , until it beams
And i to lift with playing
The arrow of anguish fell .
Where the great planets drove their glittering wheels ,
Seasons will pass till autumn fades the rose ;
To which god only held the key --
Who well deserve the praise that virtue gives .
It makes no difference ; the same weak voice ,
Fair stood the wind for france ,
Our murderous thoughts have burned the brand of cain .
We entertained a drift of leaves ,
To cross the glorious frontiers of the light ,
For the deceitful counsel which he gave .
And where the fiercest currents swung .
His faith and kindred to betray .
From whence come beams of comfort ,
A strange and strong desire he could not name .
A shrill-winged sound comes flying
Who loves his people ’s good to see ?
How in the world came this fine casket here ?
For the poor make no new friends ;
His sainted brother pine his years away .
This tower rose in the sunset like a prayer ;
How can i feel affection for him ?
The hail that strews the battle-field
Or laid aside forlorn :
Time flies so fast it takes my breath !
They dream great deeds of ages older ,
Till its own heart its own heat overcame ,
Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid .
Who would set the mob aboon the throne ,
They the gladsome tidings bring ,
Serai 's built in ages gone ,
Or holds their fury in suspended reins :
The grand ideal that his manhood sought ;
That followed bharat stayed its course ,
If aught unto the sight brief pleasure gives ,
But yonder aslant comes the silvery rain ,
What king can bear a rival in his sway ?
Snows lie deep upon the hill-side ,
Yet -- all that drove my heart thereto ,
And poured its silver light , and pure ,
Soft leaves that sift the sunbeams let
The very flower that we stoop to smell
With spring that thrills her warm blood into wine .
In perfect love hath found thee .
Be tasted ere it work ; the last exceeding
But love makes many lovely customs end .
They to your efforts lent their generous aid ,
And his heart within him fluttered ,
Joy holds the world again in her embrace
" to which all human powers should tend ,
Greatening and darkening as it hurried on ,
And crush the rash invader back !
Tears shall take comfort , and turn gems ,
The senate heard him , and his country loved .
Love is not won in a breath ,
And telling by her anxious eyes
The grass of fifty aprils hath waved green
To meet the kisses of the flowerets there .
And soon his smiles are quenched in tears :
A wild temptation seized her . she would clasp ,
With wicker arks did come
Round hills , with fluttering tree-tops feathered ,
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet .
Ye sons of fiction , clad in stupid prose ;
The shining gold their crucible gives out ;
Some ease at least those pious rites may give ,
The flowers that my life had grown ,
Spread to the rest , and freedom brought .
The abbess shook off her lethargy .
Fireflies were quenched on the dewy corn ,
Filled the evening star with music ,
O cares which come with every sun ,
Those eyes sent a light in need .
I like the ribbon that doth bind her hair --
All rich spices thence will flow .
And wailed aloud , no other answer came .
His heavenly arms the bráhman gave ,
As his careful ear the tapping caught .
Till all at once he gave a spring ,
So that you would not only get the poetry ,
And day looks out with open eye ,
Thou shinedst there ere any life began ,
Wherein the heart reads , writ in tears ,
In such a measure as faith makes it ours ,
This parallel we need not follow :
Give us your speech , master peter ! "
Making loveliness all perfect by infused divinity .
Ashes that sang and dust that shone with thought .
O fairest form the world can show !
That spring came on forever , "
The moment came , disorder split the realm ;
How near new york their schooners ran .
Through trial sent and victory given .
So that death might come upon him .
But the cheerful spring came kindly on ,
Shall come a time of grief ,
Pressed by their hosts . the people behold
As it played lover over your sweet sleeps ,
In bess 's time ; why , it 's conceded
Where i last night came ,
The rose that deepened with that kiss --
And gave us a second confusion of babel ,
A little gift once made to you --
And at her guiltless son the vengeance aims ,
With revelations fitted to their growth
My verse intrudes on this sad theme ;
And aeons have followed thee far :
Could stir that sleep ;
Those who felt toward each other
Down his red sails takes .
What wealth the show to me had brought ;
But let her face possess what charm ye will ,
The yoke that spain has worn so long .
Love 's honey-horn god holds above --
Beneath diseases bowed and bent ,
Procure her beauty , make that beauty chaste ,
Small difference lies between thy creed and mine .
Sometimes , ( and a pang would seize me
Who lift to god for us the holy smoke
Satan that sees the pagan 's fury blind ,
From whence arise diversitie of sects ,
Within a cable 's length their vessels lay
Her annual voyage , borne on winds ; the air
His heart will break through his distress and woe ,
Two hours passed , then a dim lightening came .
Give a single spark , my husband ,
Their love enhanced by sorrows they had shared .
And bathe in those billows of light
The beverage may work the proper cheer .
The beaver plants himself to wage his war ;
It went
Again in folly 's path might go astray ;
For i will follow thee to heaven or hell ;
A luminous glory shone about her face ,
The guilty realms of tantalus shall bleed ;
Held to his laughter , through the falling night .
The monarch ceased . in answer came
Carefully the harp was carried
Their clothes are colors that softly gleam .
These bonds he bears , and he may please
You have taken our faith in each other -
The cauld mool mony a bosom bears ,
Through a cycle of birth hereafter run .
Till ráma burned with rage .
I 've waited long and ground my teeth ,
I can remember them , i see
And murmuring through the vines came gleaming bees .
Then within my soul i feel thee
Deep in his heart old bells are beaten again ,
" fate gave the word -- the arrow sped ,
What blessings haste the soul to meet ,
His soul against the world , but do you see
And so it came that i killed with my sword
Nine the locks that there secured it ,
The breath of music . i have found
The moon upon that dreary country shed ,
And those three boys left fatherless . )
* mary seeking jesus when lost
As the sunset a color on lily leaves throws ,
They are like deaths : they bring a wintry chill
Vernal delight and joy , able to drive
As the combs went in her hair .
While the sweet notes their swelling numbers rolled ,
The best of conquerors poured his sighs ,
But my love comes not any day .
He has reckon 'd too long without him ;
It takes a fairy ear .
All the earth bound with frost ,
That squeezes even the little guts of mice ,
I fix my soul on chloe 's eyes .
At sunset they began to take in sail ,
And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away .
They reach the ear to fascinate the heart ;
And what makes poverty and waste in lives :
Thy life to thy neighbor 's creed has lent .
They challenge truth . an empire makes reply .
Your thursday evening club now takes its place .
A gentle vision comes by night
Long be the light of memory found
Pindus receives the breezes of the west
And it never makes a sound .
Fell , like a flail on the garnered grain ,
And all folk groaned for pity of their friend ,
Into my bosom and be lost in me .
Where joy comes to the living ?
What shall we do when hope is gone ? "
Northward and ever north we pressed ,
About the slim young widow who doth sit
I miss my dreams -- they fade so fast ,
Nor veils his figure , -- such reliance gave
He 'd sparked it with full twenty gals ,
Where soul with soul lies prisoned .
For him , those chambers held barbarian hordes ,
Immense , deals round . now whilst the victor stands
Down to the bosom where my treasures lie .
The delight of our eyelids was made
That wrought the deed of shame ?
Fame was not slow the noble act to swell ,
Smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds ,
Into a sea of bitter memories flows ;
So tangled in its custom 'd toils that smile
And hurried off to make the sacrifice .
And for medea too is vengeance paid .
What words the parent 's joy can tell ,
Wine that recalls the glow of spring ,
What answer could you give ?
Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds .
Here is set forth how the lover made complaint
And spring-time 's come again .
" love for the virtue which attended me
The drums of heaven pealed loud and long ,
That dripped with melancholy gold :
What love from him had hidden till that day ;
And shame said : i am sorrow comforted .
Where waves are swelling peacefully ;
Surprised with this evil no way they find ,
Repenting but in words , that stand as teeth
Disease , and sorrow 's weeping train ,
Now the frost , that meets and stops
Her health ! and would on earth there stood ,
English in which sprung rhythm is employed not for
Of land makes life , but sweet content _ .
Her lips like coral gates kept in
Nor leaves in so great numbers fall away
The turf crawled and the fungus crept ,
Till now the distant island rose in view :
The chastity of death hath touched her so ,
That rolls its sullen murmurs o'er thy grave .
But by malprime was neither ruled nor seen .
With all the woes which follow sin ;
That cycles have hoarded in brilliance ;
Twelve maidens should go through those roman ways
Only few still hold as sacred
Sometimes this mysterious structure was drawn up to heaven and
Which kills from ashes -- this potential hate ,
Waits for the holy hands that took
The love that to my friends i bore ;
If they were not hardened by war and rhyme .
While sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves ;
And fate withdraws all sadness from the past .
" are you prepared to make every sacrifice ? "
Who hath made the universe .
The symphony was gone ; i stayed alone
The little votive cake it humbly lays ,
Have much honour and take big chances ,
Which added doubly to my former fear .
Go spend your beauty like the summer sky
Though her tears fell , one by one :
To kill with music this most languid noon . "
With the dim gold that lit her hair ,
The autumn winds shake the hundred grasses .
Nor trace the turn of every tide ;
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
Forth came a crowd with muffled laughter ,
The years , that heaven to them denied .
" the spring is come to nazareth
Oh , who would bear life 's stormy doom ,
On their shoulders held the sky .
Shall , in a dusky red , proclaim
Are shining on the sad abodes of death ,
Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise ,
That onward came some space from whence i stood .
With thy celestial song . up led by thee
And on this gripped and mortal-sweating den
" and he in return gave scoffs and chains !
Boisterous with quivering stars buoyed bubble-light
The rosy rays of evening fell ,
Monotonous , monotonous -- days and nights pass .
And with a father ’s rapture pressed
A doom that ever poised itself to fall ,
Watched the great hills like clouds arise and set ,
Delay not : ere the western sky is hung
Is like a dance of strength circling around ,
Salute me lowly as they go ;
In the gift he could measure and praise ,
The said contractress had it read through
Then at the dawning , as day was breaking ,
Against his foes so knightly himself the warrior bore .
He made for the robin a doublet of red ,
America is standing by !
Preparations were made for the christmas ball .
The eagle plunge to find the air --
Till thou peelest me the sandstone ,
The anguish that smote my heart
Rust red as gore crawled on their arms of might
We dealt with books , we trusted men ,
Which , sealed with mirth , these many thousand years
To match the music strains its wild essay ,
The addition of his empire , how it showed
What i now feel in writing the adieu ,
And only those who find and follow its laws
Wrung forth by love ’s consuming pain ,
His vast love holds all this and more .
From place to place his love the maidens brought .
Think ye , can words alone preserve them ?
Will often make a father feel
They left the raft that brought them o’er ,
At life 's end for the sabbath supper meet .
' but much i am forced to dispense with
And thought divine before thee bows in reverence .
Devoured with greed , consumed with jealousy .
The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung :
Bending my soul to the yoke of their bondage ,
Sith ignorance our kingdome did confound ,
Where the winds blow free .
Their daily round to tread .
Thence came it those three stood at entering
That hides the loving flame ,
And lost in profound meditation she seem 'd .
The crickets made the oldtime garden shrill ;
Ah , no ! the moral will not strain ;
Above , how high , progressive life may go !
If there be to your malice no limit imposed ,
It may assist upon the wheels of fate ,
'till time and chance have drawn aside
No isle of rest , no haven could claim
But melanippus pierced heroic son
They drove our goodly fighters forth ,
And grey rocks rose amid the red
Think they in wisdom all mankind surpass ;
The king who sees how well his vanguard sped ,
To tell the grief and heart felt pains ,
The vision is gone , the splendour faded ,
Prismed while it lay buried deep .
Rank follows rank like billows to the shore .
When in life 's drama sorrow took no part .
Should a black hero first to battle go ,
Where the lark finds her deep nest in the grass
And he spoke the words which follow :
But all faults shall flee afar from thee ,
My throne to hers shall go ;
Nor dream that this our love can pass away .
Who with his troop to paris made repair .
But tell of days in goodness spent , --
The fire got out through crannies in the stove
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
But a civiller sentiment came in the way :
To meet the wintry season .
Thy stars shall light our victory
With quickest glance could read another 's thought ,
War and bloodshed do they bring us ;
Of the candles that shed their soft lustre
To nail the black lie of denying .
-- it is his sudden heart that breaks
And turned life 's crowning bliss to deadly sin .
Such power entrusted ; nor hold thou the deed
Came the blast of the storm-wind keen ,
The neck that made that white robe wan ,
He found an author writing his life ,
That thou wilt be pleased to consider the tower ,
Home to obscure endurance to be borne
If sorrow e'er this calm should break ,
Where the high trust is fixed on truth alone ,
To last , a love set pendulous between
So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit
Looked forward to a day of wrath .
And every duty pays at last its cost .
Lo ! health appears ! celestial dame !
To give back the pleasure he took ;
Calls forth their life my spirit lay ,
I pray to god to give me sorrow and care
For all he bore of our humanity ;
To reach the realms of endless morn ;
This sad heart gives ,
But summers will vanish and years will wane ,
To him his back the murmuring dolphin gave ;
" straightway iron made this promise ,
Which made him look so cloudy and so cold ;
With joy the white clouds navigate the blue ,
Was shaken by the flight of startled bird ;
To aim at highest honours , and surpass
But of his light the beam , must needs attract
But the yankees caught it at bull run .
And flames wrap hill and wood ,
Thy constant flow of love that knew no fall ,
Or chains of columbines shall make
Will make them old before their years .
But in their midst a radiant lily came
Thou whom the summer crosses , as a fawn ,
Oh ! could such moments ever fly ;
Made things lively at st. thomas .
Each rosy ray from heaven withdrew ;
The wind lies asleep in the arms of the dawn
Their beauteous glances downward sending ,
When all the ends of life take hands and meet
The temper of the king he saw .
How the wind finds no comfortable grass
Which fearful enemies murmured at as wrong .
The verdant arch so close its texture kept :
From string to string , then reaching high and higher
Has yielded all to one sweet helplessness :
But give to me the snoring breeze
He made his own jests from the throne
And i recalled the features of forese .
If fate had held a careless knife
Fear comes at first ; but soon , rejoiced ,
Sad was the parting thou makes me remember ,
That so its woman-depth might hold
Where earth and heaven do make one imagery :
And the hopeless lance was laid in rest ,
The feeble births acquired diseases chase ,
The cry draws nearer though distant still ,
And in a softened voice she 'd add :
The world that works , the heaven that waits ,
Danger deviseth shifts ; wit waits on fear :
And in her heart a bitter echo made ;
Our german bands inflame the balmy air ;
Those social guests for whom the board was spread .
" the date of the resurrection passes
And rainy drapery swept across ;
What wonder justice , reason , stood aghast ,
The custom lost , the drain upon the hoard ,
Can not touch the notes of concord !
And gave her a smile of approval and favour .
Who in my house vile treachery has made . "
And when the evening season i have reached ,
Though summer walks the world to-day
Yet will his squadron not so firmly stand ,
And the empty plates bore witness
When will thy slaying bring on the morning bright ,
A coal-black chariot hurried through the gloom ,
The cobbles see this all along the street
Their happy spots the nice admirer take ,
Can feel beneath a northern sun ,
For love concerns expressly meant ,
He sought himself the river , where he guessed
Those golden wings that cut the yielding skies .
Many the tasks that lightlier lend themselves
Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill ,
Then she veiled her face in sorrow ,
Unto my eyes strange showes presented were ,
And the good south wind still blew behind ,
The buoyant life of song can floating be
Anguish came upon the swallower ,
To find a charm in novelty ,
Destruction on thy head wilt bring .
Dimly my thought defines ;
The morning dream that hovered o'er her head ,
The yew-tree leaf will suit :
Then came the crisis , strange to say ,
The lore that hellas taught to rome ,
Since it has left so slight a sting . "
Which saw thus young beauty
And an answer will certainly come .
Where angels claim their birth ,
And thundering came their angry roar ,
The wind may blaw , the heathen rage ,
Too easily brought to tears and weakness by music ,
Amidst of these menelaus led his wife
Or birds that raise their songs by morning light ,
It fades -- the night wind is forlorn --
Shed its light .
Taking a heart that beat with love most true ,
Another love receives my vow :
And agents of my will drave far and wide
And pity wholly failed , that somewhere , sometime ,
The great proficiency he made abroad ,
Dressed with flowers i see ,
And to my sighs brings the rushing wave only
It hideth the harsh furrows that the wheels
Come , i venture to give you my word ,
With lip and finger signs that said ,
The wind blew in through the open port ,
“ mourning , her words in a soft dying tone
To wonder 's realm allures the earnest child ;
The power of the lord shall fill this frame .
The time draws near the birth of christ ;
Whence breaks the rose and all the flowers that greet
The smiles on him bestowed .
The quay-lights pushed a livid flare
Turning to gold all it touches and tries ?
The same lubricity was found in all ,
But at the last these left her labouring ,
Such sights hath memory to show ,
Another 's turn prepares , another follows fast .
And moaned , his proud words hurt her so .
And through their comrades spurring from the field
And his heart within him fluttered ,
What gospels lost the woods retrieve ,
With lips prepared and firm , and eyes alight .
The hunter won , though hardly pressed ,
Warriors carry the warrior 's pall ,
Hath bred the foul impieties of men :
Thirsty , spent with his toil and faint ,
High pastures morning and evening scattered with small
That hearts and tongues did lodge so far asunder .
The knots that in those infinite worlds found place ,
And prints with frolic step the melting snows ;
That lay on earth and air ,
From that which youthful fancy drew !
' neath light demeanours hide strength and passion ;
And , noblest , with these words addressed
Of friendly warnings , which around me flew ;
My father 's praise i did not miss
" three years no rain had fallen .
Of all who have felt the vaulted body 's pangs
As the cloud-colours came and went .
And whenever came a feast-day ,
Her heart was troubled yet comforted ,
Till with infinite solicitude they made him understand
May make the nectar which it can not find ,
Nay , life itself the heart would spurn ,
From the bottom he set up a pitiful shout ,
So unaffected , so composed a mind ,
Parted , alas ! i carry from its source ,
That brings death to the mother who hath nursed
Thy father , boy , bore never into fight
Her soul , passed through the fire ,
With death ’s last fear my face he eyed ,
And morning sings with a warm odorous mouth .
What christmas ghost can make us chill --
Of miserable men , he took no count ,
With broaching rebellion and raising commotions ,
Not knowing that her heart held court
To keep long day with his caresses graced .
Though i waste watches framing words to fetter
“ decrepitude with trembling steps has come ,
He hears the wild waves beat the shore ,
And spirit coming to create new worlds .
The house of peers made no pretence
‘ alas , that ever i see thys day !
One lonely recluse breathes the air ;
No austere faith based on ignoble fear
It warms my heart to view her ,
That gazed back at me so gay and glorified ,
Soon as the morn reveals the roseate east ,
For weight would n't stop him , nor distance ,
And i made some nice friends on the voyage ,
They flew behind her pensive brow
Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed ,
But all through the years the fond mother kept
Thy days from fear and peril freed ;
Harmless the while , the lurking venom slept .
And , winter having come and gone ,
Their eyes forgot their tears ;
There kept it , and so lived in fantasy .
The dim throngs moved until the day was done .
And their own emptiness discern .
" god who registers the cup
With lion 's rage swung round ;
He turn 'd on her a look
Such intercourse as man with woman holds .
With eager looks the litter eyed .
Where eden stood of yore ,
" what is that within you see ?
And the egg-shell went to sea .
A sight to make our faith more pure and strong
Was all the fond heart could say :
Put life and mettle in their heels .
Boats against the wind that travel . "
For what the coming day may bring .
Preserved through time , the speaking scenes impart
And when the tumult of the war is gone ,
This cloudy rack that gathers o'er the skies ?
In the dark paths we tread in hope and fear
- the few steps taken at a funeral pace
How roses first came red , and lilies white .
Shall sift both believers and you : --
Whole ages have fled and their works decayed ,
Forsooth the present we must give
All gervase told to her but made her lean
Came where the subtle traitor lay ,
I shared her pain , and calmed her grief ,
Descending from the lady 's bosom fair ,
Let heavenly joy thy thoughts engage ;
So let this health go round ;
His wealth consumed ; for he is now become
Was moved to tears and laughter --
With eyes refreshed , on all that lay around ,
Then went my way to kill and lie --
That base and sensual life , which leads
From labour could not wean them ,
And blushes chasing all about her face ,
The rabble , makes long furrows with his brand .
A shower of shafts to meet him sent .
All sweet and various things do lend themselves
And his measures are as follow :
Wherein your careless carrion lies at peace ?
He measures caesar 's value of his own .
There , as the hundreds slow moving go ,
Get up at six , and things 'll fix .
Upon his fleshly corpse to make invasion :
Inflamed the hearts that for it sank and died ,
And steps that led to a neglected lawn ,
That show 'd the place she occupied in air .
Your granite gates -- the eagle seeks the sky ,
This way lies safety , that way ill .
Dappled with milk-white clouds that swim
The rites thus served he , leaving none ,
To where entombed in life he lay ,
Nor at the first could i from tears withhold .
By fame been raised .
We tread on could not in as many years .
The supreme essence from which this is drawn .
Bring their tribes to fell destruction .
To give my opinion on some foreign wine .
Of fair things gone beyond recall ,
Man 's caution often into danger turns ,
All that was needful to my soul it gave :
" there are six true hearts will follow
And night is coming down !
Although our suffering meet with no relief ,
Another vision followed hereupon :
Of their great emperor , when the morning came ,
Which his long absence oft has made
And let the snowdrop 's trembling whiteness
My sails are spread -- farewell . "
Placed our natures asunder ; and we two again ,
Pagan temples own her sway ; --
That fills my heart with sadness !
You money magic to far lands has whirled ;
Pastures tracked deep with cows ,
That thaws and mitigates the frozen sky .
And it hid the shining sunlight ,
Down all the circling ages run ,
That made a glory of earth .
His ship diminished , was low , was gone ;
Did the youth pass these pictured stories by ,
Now hangs as mute on tara 's walls
With greater floods her weeping eyes ran o'er .
Whose train of light shall follow long !
For him who must see many years ,
Some bend the stubborn bow for victory ,
As schooling of your soul to make it precious ,
Perverse and foolish oft i strayed ,
Thou canst never hide the moonlight ,
All losses are restored and sorrows end .
Pure thoughts that make to god their quest ,
And gives them work and wealth and joy .
There infinite distance into nearness grows ,
Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes , that stood
Hast felt thy soul prolong the tone ;
He curdles the bleak air with ire ,
" the junipers and prickly chestnuts stand ,
That seemed to give her cheeks caresses ,
That had gone
The war progressed , for time rolls on the same
In the mead the emperor made his bed ,
Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide :
No prow has ever pressed -- or shall
In many an orbit wheels , then lighting sits
O thou , whose glorious , yet contracted light ,
Absence more strongly on his mind portray 'd
The implacable discord went , and with the dame ,
If she recalled the valentine
In these suppose it placed , one greatly blessed ,
Thy words might raise from earth the heaviest heart .
No woe dims the moon-face tonight .
Moonlight and morning , softly blending , lay
The battle breathed , or as against the shore
Mute , motionless , her sad watch keeping ;
What made or bade thee rise :
“ it passes to the breezes and the air ;
Two smelling , swelling , bashful cherrylets ,
Their youthful sighs denoted their despair ,
That serves my peace ;
Across his back in order passed .
Looks oft beyond his term set here ,
Till the full rapture swept the bard along ,
Benign , and of our merit take no count .
All worn with long monotonies of pain .
Take heart ! the promised hour draws near ;
Into the great new realms i must not tread .
The calm-eyed people go .
With the scent of roses filled ,
And seems to one in drowsiness half lost ,
" that to the full thy knowledge may extend
The weight which makes thee faint ;
No terror shall touch the quiet dead
May break the guard of the three kings
The song that 's meant for one alone .
To linsey-woolsey to reach heaven !
And shake the brazen concave of the skies .
And the winds rose up and ranged ,
Till happier fortune brought them sweeter dole .
To comb the tangled language of the people
As black the boding shadows fall ;
A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
Pliant and apt , they lose no chance to show
All smiles ran the highways wet ;
To get the name and an estate .
But of his light the beam , must needs attract
I ceased to follow , for the knot of doubt
While our feet still cling to the heavy clay .
That all things fell out happily
And at every drifting cloud that went
Nor spread arachne o'er her curious loom .
Tell thee all that in my heart lies hidden .
For though i meet with many contradictions
It 's rippling song of gladness from the
Call to the storm and drive them flying ,
Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led ,
Confusion on the worlds shall bring .
And nature shiver 'd at approaching death .
So the fair moth , within the amber drowned ,
So soon the hurrying years crowd on apace ,
That taught the groves my rosalinda 's name :
Domes of astonishment , to heal the mind .
And life her hidden realms displayed
The lids may shut out fleshly fears ,
His sterling worth had worked a cure ,
To stiffen the gazing earth as stone .
I can not put into speech .
What sit we then projecting peace and war ?
No joy remains on earth for me ,
On valentine 's day came a maiden to woo ,
See how bacchus ’ nectar flows ,
You rush to battle , humbling british pride ;
Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth :
Close following pace for pace , not mounted yet
" there hung a deep black cloud ,
O virgin ! or what other name you bear
Ever reaches this valley of woe .
The sorrow into which we sudden fell
Dear to mankind thy fame survives , nor fades
The tears were dropping from my eyes .
And with his mercy washed and made them fair .
Race after race their honours yield ,
Wrecked hope and passionate pain will grow
The word that shall give me rest .
My palace lit for a revelry ;
And raving goes thus harrying other people . "
And checked the rising sigh ;
And oh , his heart that holds me ,
From the warm wave emerging into day ;
Of those imperial titles , which assert
He lies with all his painted terrors glaring ;
They look to more than truth , and so confirm
Young roses kindled into thought .
And take and give the joy that hari grants ,
Two wings of flame that lifting swept
Here then the moment comes when i crave light .
The mist-like banners clasped the air ,
With mournful joy , to think that others felt
This subtle speech was aimed to please
We too take ship o soul ,
The best of bráhmans answer made :
And plumes that never waved with pride ; --
Legends they that once were taken
I dreamed that over my heart flamed and scorched
For grief on bitter grief encompassed her .
Timid for him who follows . so the bird ,
That the wood-nymph 's call may echo ,
His name remain .
There shineth a serener day
Loathingly glides the muse through scenes of strife ,
That ever came upon this grieving world
Ere the year 's course is run ,
And ever , as the minutes flew ,
And found the world a wilderness ,
And pleasure , risen from her own warm mould
Till i to you my album have presented .
The dardan javelin , urged with impulse sheer ,
To her the forest lent its lyre ,
Beyond which thy pride scorns to go ,
Then ráma as he took the road
The happier i feel , the more
And all my heart leaps up to greet
And calls his senses from the verge of death .
And rose at once by pity stirred :
His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth . "
Each word that from her sweet lips fell ,
Who lightest holds his life .
With homes that dwelt on leader-side ,
That he be sent , to drive their guilty hands
Our hearts with their anguish are broken ,
And dark rocks ring to shouts of liberty !
The fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew .
Then he spake the words which follow ,
Daughter of priam , make thy lips to cry
My heart 's chain wove ;
A conquest with his silence makes :
Tongues of land were linked together . "
Who catch 'd his worship on the hip ,
Behind all this a fearful shadow looms ,
That i may purge away my grave offences .
Where light was bred in the ruby walls ,
And lights that shine are shut again
The time which bears the name of autumn -- then
What conscience tells us we should shun ,
And fortune leading on , and favouring fates ,
Merrily , merrily , to welcome in the year .
_ and while his country staggers with the cross ,
To that great hermit made reply :
And carrying inward a serene
From hopes long buried , by thy tender grace ?
Then comes the grim awakening -- the end .
Supplies fit ornament , as now i told .
Each one kept shroud , nor to his neighbour gave
Nor found she from her labour rest ,
And i scratched the wind and whined ,
No help his life could save ;
With deep eyes burning through a blank white hood :
Though loaded with trouble and pain ;
All else belongs unto that solemn shrine ,
She met the blow and sunk into his arms ,
An ' get the brutes the power themsel 's
And all the world is washed with dew ! "
Down crashed the walls . our lovely spire --
And in its haven found the fleet arrayed .
Take full possession ; all my soul is thine .
That writes these lines to thee .
No word of treachery i could read ;
And should bring ; for his passion-fevered heart
I see how deep a loss is mine ,
Since his disease to christ he brings ?
Filled with anger , spake as follows :
't is we must give you peace .
And custom lie upon thee with a weight
Till now , encouraged by the grace you give ,
That looked the love it owns ! " --
Weary and damp we reached our poor abode ,
Though better speed was urged by the clown --
In valleys where she stands .
And on they took their way together .
Like a wild bee , flies a sure line
And whichever way it may blow
Only made the fire burn brighter ,
Her letters , photograph , and find a joy
The wild war stilled on every hand ;
The season 's flight unwarn 'd we mark ,
And tables show , heaped with the best --
That time would temper juan 's faults of youth ;
The soul by pure religion taught to glow
And all the mirth-mad world makes holiday !
And make fear dig its own false tomb .
The king marsilius holds the place ,
The hindrance lies
Where skeleton elm-trees reach with frozen gesture
As much of noon as i could take
The gods and saints glad voices raised ,
As evening shadows stretch o'er moor and dell ;
Where the dead men lost their bones .
Their beauty might declare :
My soul is sailing through the sea ,
The placid lake that rested far below ,
Unto him as he spoke ; fresh colour came
But , torn by paynim hatred ,
Of such commotion , such as to set forth
Wherein no fatal likeness should intrude
His wish to mend , but fearful of mistake ,
Than the vindictive wrath which men call justice !
Whereon to vent their rage ,
Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
But wake thy vengeance and provoke thy rage .
How god in pity stayed his hand ,
Too feeble should be found , and yet to learn
What friends ! to whom i owe eternity
An empire 's honour saved from death
That came from the harbor bar .
Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Nor spectres stalk to frighten harmless mirth ,
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield .
Which separate from the scabbard met his view ;
From revelry to revelry he passed ,
Only her memory lives to-night --
Casts forth a light like to a virgin flame ;
The man whose virtues are more felt than seen ,
Though sore the taunts went stabbing through her breast ;
What a wild mad thrill our veins would fill
To turn to house of buckingham their eyes .
And at night-time are folded in slumber
Angels , allied , descend to feed the fire ;
So slightly , musically made ,
Deep the sleep that settled o'er her .
Bends its rich blossoms over lonely streams
To bright apollo 's awful name designed ,
And sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain . "
Making more real this brooding quietness .
The mountains rose above .
The choice we make , or justify it made ;
But the steel he could not sever ,
Unchained by action , action binds not him ;
Thick horror like a cloud had veiled my sight ,
For nothing passes wholly . all is changed .
Yet still with consciousness ; and there it stands
Where the dim sunlight hardly comes at all
For me the ocean lifts its solemn psalm ,
Joyfully she took the prize
Sweetly the morning star is set . '
And in thy waves his various blessings show .
With their tear drops , shed in sorrow ,
And stillness there spreads out like the great night .
Thro ' which the sounds came floating took away
And in that hour , when conquest came ,
Fulfil the duties as they come ;
So the new passion seized and changed the form ,
A spirit new did her those prayers teach ,
Perhaps a warrior , and those arms have borne
For handel 's music was made ready .
Each star of hope that cheered him on --
And makes the slow hours swift and light ;
Repentance seals the very act , and deed ?
" it will not go for nought . "
On floating nature-forms , the primal vast --
The valour of the brave is shown .
Unseeing , the locked lips whose song hath fled ;
So saying , the wily goddess led the way .
Is woven first of them ; from dreams are made
That trembled in the sunset glare aglow :
And all the torturing rage , melted away .
Poetic melancholy loves to tread ,
Watching the embers which the fire dropped .
And the spent dogs that follow them about ,
But has left this position ,
The battle hung . " ]
And leaning back , he yawned and fell asleep ,
He was oft found in fits of fretfulness .
A light that made them lovely . his own heart
What vanity is envy ! for i find
He strains his eyes the void to scan ;
A stately tomb , whose top a trumpet bore ,
Speaking shall go , and note the great patricians
Can match the praise of italy ; nor ind ,
' a master shepherd is attach 'd to each ,
Not so hath victory fled this hated hand ,
Comes peace in the afterglow .
Hold each strange tale devoutly true ;
Loose to the wind , whose airy garments flew ,
A music as of wind and water ran ,
Till christmas comes perchance , before
It shall be waited on with jealousy ,
His own far blood , which dwelt at camelot ;
( for wine mounts to the brain ) ;
And grateful vows , and generous thanks might pay
Loud talkers with the winds that pass ;
Does your heart run cold with a silent dread ?
Nor left alone can she her person save ,
Till he reached the blue-sea 's margin ,
This instant see his short-lived trophies won ,
The western tide crept up along the sand ,
And come and make your summer dwelling here ,
And these grey ash trees hold within them
As that which made our love complete ,
Shall none more forward than this couple go :
To whom at alcala i sadly gave
Amidst whose tall battalions goes
' twould kill the bliss which they intend ;
Midway bound potentiality with act
Enjoys the air it breathes .
Some by old words to fame have made pretence ,
Give peaceful triumph to the truth ,
Oh ! be the faithful process borne ,
Foresaw the dangers of the growing war ,
Now to some foreign clime inclined to fly ,
Are green and waving hymns which whisper truth !
The souls in torment came ,
Smooth-moving came oceanus the old ,
Upon her eyes that chased their short eclipse .
And the moonlight flowing over all .
And feel the light unutterable shine
Whose fingers drum those passionate blows ,
Most true , methinks , in thee is shown
Making new year 's calls .
She shews producing , loaded thick with fruit .
An hour of peace and triumph came ,
Which makes the marriage-day to be ,
Though boundless oceans roll 'd between ,
That rend thy nobler self apart .
They work their eyes the truest ,
The heart of nature in me spoke ;
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
Is better than to make the experiment ,
And life 's best blood must seal the sacrifice .
And driven like autumn leaves before the wind .
Her child , she feels , is living still ,
And womanish patricians filled their place .
About thee stands in mournful mood
For by that chance which ever serves ill ends ,
It had to sink , defeated .
Truth thy soul ecstatic now drinks up ,
Came the wild macgregor 's clan-call ,
Some sighing echo stirred : -- and then
The fly 's bass turned a lion 's roar ;
No light amour this , leaving shield unflecked ;
As then she rose . the shock had flashed
The rainbow 's glory is shed .
His bodie left the spectacle of care .
Which i , as years passed , faintly
Loose to the wind her azure mantle flies ;
My love has seen me promising ,
Were i ordained and called to preach ;
They stay their crystal fretting ,
Yet her firm breast some virgin tremors shook ;
My heart was formed to prove , --
And then load the air around her
It says that life would signify
Through the faint clouds exalt their sparkling green .
Then reached the caverns measureless to man ,
What means this bustle , betty foy ?
To cast her shadow o'er the child ?
Where never a grave should find us .
To pour your vengeance on the guilty foe .
In other peril , soon as i had mounted ,
Some break the wings , some let them rise
And love says amen to the word ,
Who gave this poignard its premier stain
We did n't change without some sacrifice ,
The dust that on his shoulders lay .
Until the night come o'er the grund ,
That thought which friendship can not tell ,
Of flickering horror in the sectors where
The morning came , the chaise was brought ,
And shake the eastern world with war 's alarms ,
To claw common sense for her sins ;
Before time makes a man of me ?
Up there where the silence sings ,
The woman 's touch runs through our magazines ;
The sage in meditation found ,
Fuller than any gathered by the gods ,
Joyous days now gone forever --
The work she plied , but studious of delay ,
Found the remedy of ukko ,
But destiny and passion spread the net
Red lightning skirs the panting air ,
As though the stormy drops were turned to sound ;
But life and love will soon come by . --
My singing soul makes music in thine own ,
O little laughing blooms that lift and bless !
But comes the violence of the bigger rains
And cypresses reissue from the shade ,
What heights of excellence must he ascend ,
The sun moves hither , leaving capricorn ;
Wherein love 's flame began to flicker now .
A human soul , that drifts at liberty ,
And so startled his steed that was winding at will
Broken-hearted , flushed with anger ,
Weeping o'er the trust we hold
The seeds of treason choke up as they spring :
Love which god 's heaven encouraged -- love that drew
That , if you ask for proof of this ,
And all my limbs were stiffened as i fled ,
Who in life steadfast have stood .
The phantom armies marching go !
Thou shalt soon this cottage see .
In memory 's volume let them hold
Only words remained , palpitating and few ,
But i could frame a wish for thee
Has never tasted happiness . "
Your salvation , for you see ,
There , where the starlight thickly trails
Swiftly spending , slowly raising ,
At last they called for devouring fire ,
The chief to the churl a challenge addressed ;
My love , my love flashed by like spring !
In trials whence touts take their winner ,
For those may fail , or turn to ill ,
To make away with folks ' best things ?
The triumph he for us acquired .
To these the warrior sent his voice around .
At each new step we feel the burden grow ,
So tall , he almost touched the sky ;
When day down the eastern way has come .
Whose tender lay the fate of linus sings ;
His little fair page now follows alone ,
And stirred this vice in you which ruined man
And breathe fresh life in ev'ry gale .
Another rock will yield you passage safe .
And catch the light of their clearer eyes ,
His priceless treasures hold ;
Here they dwelt while-years rolled onward ,
That strewed that fatal strand ;
Of morning , pierce the barean wilderness ,
It awed but struck no terror to the heart .
Oh ! for the temperate airs that blow
The inquest 's end would leave him undisclosed
This love shall live another day ,
Her bounds preserve inviolate , though we die ?
And nothing asks of fortune , or of men .
The bursting tears my heart declare --
A sudden horror shot through all the chief ,
Which for the mighty sultan bore a treasure .
Did not fill our hearts with sorrow ,
Who often wept for zion , and felt pain
And memory lies prone and languishes
That thro ' a sweet vale lay ;
And lead the life of petty household care
That fed the baptist in the wilderness ;
Which cutting off through hasty accidents ,
My trembling hand in thine i laid ?
To banish doubt -- what folly have i said ?
And to raise the landmarks for me ,
Instant , the initiate 's trials were prepared , --
Though years have passed , and time has strown
The rising moonlight 's silver blew .
“ weighs heavy on me , and the deeds beheld
Earth , whom thy swift feet pressed :
Autumn winds roll through the dry leaves
Of fancy rise full springing : but not mine
Through a waste void the soulless atoms run ,
How fair a world to you is given .
And a hundred faiths set free ,
Would admit that most of his stuff is greek .
By fear too great to bear .
As the merchants lay before the land .
Before the christian , and their war lay still ;
When it stops giving , comes in death .
In poisoned blades is placed ; but trustest thou
Back from battle , torn and rent ,
His rays resistance met . i turn 'd aside
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths ;
Nor spread arachne o'er her curious loom .
A fountain sprang forth in that very place ,
The north winds moan . the waterfowl are gone
The porch deposed the ghastly heap of death .
Tradition calls the hero 's targe .
To spread all the charms they together could find .
With dark blooms opening to the sun .
Now lashed to foam the troubled waters lie .
Soft and agreeable come never there .
You bring back the days departed ,
Its heaven for ever , her quiet hands would raise
Upon your hearse this flower i lay .
Has turned the garden of a symbolist .
All bear the royal stamp that speaks them his ,
Put on a glory , and my soul expand .
His lusty spearmen followed him with noise :
Body of blessings : spirit of soules extracted !
Hath stilled the waves ' alarm . '
Why not for us ? faith fails .
A bauble held the pride of power ,
Then the snow-maiden raised a wailing cry ,
That makes you fearful to unfurl your souls .
You lift me into immortality ,
And lo , his eyes were filled with tears .
And brought sea-smell of newly blossomed foam ,
And england 's priestcraft shakes to hear
Still fervent , washing from his wounds the gore .
In life and death now treads the stage again .
Of the being great who made them .
And the kisses plucked and thrown
And made their music mute , --
Each , musing , carries it to bed ,
Gave him a wisdom owned by few ,
Since , though the summer followed winter 's chill ,
To wash polluted sinners white as snow !
And hidden the march violets blew ,
A shock of laughter made them friends at once ,
While there 's a grief to seek redress ,
We have n't the means to frame a curse .
Upon the lea my pleasure grows ,
An hour more went by ; the dauber lost
Pure in the lowest artisan was seen .
The phantom for which all her hope was given ,
Of all her ardent prayers indulgence found .
Answered in the words which follow :
Experience of my youth made mee thinke humble truth
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears ,
Ere evil faith struck blind and lamed
Old joy can lend what newer grief must borrow :
She smiled on death who eased her misery .
Sees death made drunk with war , sees time
And all these sounds one sound expressed well .
Through all the years that went and came .
And now pour out thy praises
The sunset gilds the sheaves ,
A paper 's laid before me .
" he opened to me his home and heart --
Stand forth the champion , and the games renew .
Still won him second place , albeit oft
Through the chancel shot its ray ,
Was a grand one as ever i see ,
Till he cracked the vault with power --
Had swell 'd his heart , and made it rise
For he made verses wild and queer
Hellish vapours rise around .
Once when the forge of battle sang
And guests in prouder homes shall see ,
It of itself made to itself a lamp ,
May bring thee wealth untold .
His conscience felt an hell :
Inland , went sounding on , by rocks and sands
My cry prevailed , by strong affection urged .
Within , the bursting roses burn ,
My flashing eye full of love for you ,
In weather riggings died into the roar
Thus the old tyranny revives again .
No idle wit , no trifling verse can lurk
Her eyes already have sped the shades that flee ,
And let sweet music give it life .
Then like the fire that burns and glows ,
Grieved as he was , his pious arms attend ,
The spacious fields from me to heaven take on
In their fright they felt forlorner
Believe them not , for physic true doth find ,
At idleness which aspires to strive . "
Of gold and gems the altar bore !
None to save and little hope ,
And caught the kissing winds around .
The birds fierce monarch drops his vengeful ire ;
And catch the burning sparks that fly
The breeze obeyed . he breathed it o'er
Where slavery digs what slaves possess .
Struck by a nameless fear that leapt along
And to my heart it flew .
Fools in derision follow fools ! "
And the night came dark and chill ,
To catch the thrill of a happy voice ,
The years will roll into the centuries ,
Which tells me , youth 's no longer here !
Sad it steals upon mine ear ;
But humbled pride was taught to reason .
And put a period to your gladsome days ,
Some hands uplifted certain bowls they bore
Freedom yet shall summon allies
To bear through arid days
In chirping bill the little songster brings
Thy name lay chiseled in the rock ,
By no means would produce the town 's submission ,
The pride of beauty stricken in its flower ;
To-morrow , night will come again ,
The devil below was ringing his knell .
If they without them could the race maintain .
Einar then , the arrow taking
To bear the struggling woods are hardly able ,
The maple trees that spread their boughs
The fields of neptune take a purple dye .
I will send thee fell destruction ,
Your mirror , love , reflects your smile
The silken tissue of their joys disclose ,
While every breath of eve that chanced to blow ,
And now that that was gone she wept to see
Wearily the chase i eyed ,
To lay out fortune 's gifts ; and niccolo
Of living valour , rolling on the foe
Making her wife indeed , not paramour ,
Gives him warmth , and food , and shelter ,
Paled his lip and plucked his breath ,
Which day and night before thine altars rise :
To ease the empty aching of her heart .
As in that loss new might the terror took ,
The stream goes fast .
And the vast void beyond , applause resounds .
White death had laid his pall upon the plain ,
To thy desires is set .
Life -- that which includes all .
Her rainbow palace stands ,
Where no star its breath can draw .
" give us bright though broken rays ,
Who passes for in life and death most lucky ,
Well he ended the champions i found .
But soon it sinks to earth again ,
Find time to talk with him ,
From brotherhood the one way upward leads .
The rest with thanks their guerdon took ;
It sufficeth the charm was set ;
And sends strange shudders through her hurrying frame ;
The loud evangel , that proclaims the secret
Sometimes it seemed my own heart heard
Hide not a sorrow that i wish to share .
Where arthur 's wars were rendered mystically ,
Thou turnedst to thy rites away
To thee i bring my care ,
Take counsel from thy counsellor the snake ,
Like the ghosts of a giant creation gone by !
Till manly shame bids him possess his breath
Lord , lord , come nigh .
Who could a monarch 's favourite wish deny ?
The soul which thus a brutish form did take ,
And give them strength to bear their boundless loss ,
To light her faded fire ,
Reverberant notes and long blew volant fame .
The assault is reinforced on every side ,
" and darkness like the midnight fell around ,
Or a butterfly sunset claps its wings
It gives you now ,
Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out ,
At last the temples of their god it bound .
As huddled sheep , set their eyes quick ,
Til scolding thunder do pronounce the iarre .
That points the paradox of god .
" ' and pray what form shall i assume
For refuge ' mid the rude aethices drove .
While such thy prayer ; it climbs above
And took with heavy heart the way
Stood all dissolved in sadness at its tone ,
And pie tins held the same positions there .
With heart and prowess the franks have stood ;
Joy in the vánar ’s breast awoke ,
As this spacious house was building ,
Just as though it loved to linger
And george 's honours only raise a sigh --
He had tapped the central fountains of the world ,
To make his pictures sell ! "
Let them run to other forests ,
That what i see and feel i write
And put to proof his high supremacy ,
Blossom and berry the marshes hide .
Fierce wrathful yells the foe at bay reveal .
Like rhyme-words coming aptly in ,
Like one that had been led astray
Thy waters , gentle thames , to gain .
The leaf that makes a carnival of death
While thrice three weeks went past ,
Like some great monarch with his train has passed ,
If modest youth , with cool reflection crowned ,
That spirit shall go on ,
The time indeed had gone exceeding fast ,
Cold and keen the north wind blows ,
Follow a love-adventure 's winding ways .
While in france poetry has been accustomed to reflect the
As white as drifted snow . in all the court
Death , i say , my heart is bowed
Which hath gone down behind the distant hills ,
But athens fell when peter took rome ,
And , as swallows build
Wherein you dare flash forth its lightning-sword .
But drove her half out of her wits .
When dusk shrunk cold , and light trod shy ,
" pride juggles with her toppling towers ,
The shadow that follows the sun ,
And his heart stirred within him . now the queen
The shining ripples shiver , descending to the sea ;
That the worst it would gladly dare .
Think that a hundred years have now passed by ,
Woke ; and earth melted into heaven again .
' they bring me sorrow touched with joy ,
And catalogue their fortitude , whence grew ,
Just light enough to guide the wanderer 's tread .
Ere it recovers its old healthful glow .
Where the waters gently pass ,
They speak of days gone by ,
She , in free peoples planting sovereignty ,
And a shuffle of cards as they go .
Like sunshine went and came , and bade
Red o'er the forest peers the setting sun ,
And flashing from each minaret .
And when it ceased , the blood which fell
Restrain his fury , than provoke his speed ,
No sooner to my list ' ning ear had come
What human heart with truth can dare to say
These are the things that make me laugh !
And soon the fleet their ready anchors threw :
But whoso takes his cross , and follows christ
Which made him seem sole champion of the field ,
What a proof that fond passion can die ,
To bring forth fruits , joy and eternal bliss .
Struck out sick thoughts that could be overheard : -
Drums roll , and glittering columns file , and arms
The nation 's wealth was spent in vain display ,
Earth gives us thorns to tread ,
Ere the glass of your luck was run . ”
But when it set on earth arose in heaven .
For the words he scattered on kind soil fell ,
Again the still moon rose and stood
Where they would work the christian army scorn .
To take proud-gated troy , such havoc made
The picture as it came .
Brings the tears into her eyes ?
Protected by her holy life .
Whose soul is still prepared for death ,
May spur the languor of a mood
My choice declares the impulse of my mind .
But salomon packed his heart with dreams ,
Which every hour dread warning give ,
Sweet scenes thus visited on that fine day .
And the wintry world lies waiting
To bring rome in unto the way of life ,
A captive victor that hath lost in gain ;
Yet can not find that madness there !
Take back the hope you gave -- i claim
When wife and husband do fall out ,
The nightingale that in the branches sang ,
I see the fountains as they leap and flash ,
Still her charms are scarcely told .
The monster moving onward came as fast ,
And his brother henry nigh him drew .
Now gan some courage unto him to take ,
As from the cloud the forked lightning glared .
That swayed their long stems lazily , and lapped
While pettish tears adown her petals run :
That it should be wisely spent .
And moons that set and sinking suns
Where falls the seed that i have tried to sow
For grayness now my heart is set upon .
To those , who push our antidote aside ;
His promise made , to be his guardian still !
Thy courts and temples stand ;
The while for thierry drop their tears ;
And passion tore my beauty and consumed .
Then the hostess , filled with kindness ,
Your truth and valor wearing ;
Of noble figure , and quick searching eyes ,
Its brightness gives new beauty to her breast .
I will turn to sleep again .
Each note of which but adds new , downy links
She found me roots of relish sweet ,
And stole our starlight that for us was shining .
Come , if confession can discharge my sin ,
And chase the wind with me .
So centuries passed by , and still the woods
And so his lawless loves go out
And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess 'd .
And the green grove lifts high its leafy head .
High in the night , reeling great blinding arcs
I will make answer even to the thought ,
With sorrow and repentance oft assailed ,
The first aloof with erring fury flew ,
Fresh heart-sobs shook her knitted hands
Let other lovers lie , in love and rest ;
As i pass to the beach , art stirred ?
Vapour adust doth never mount above
Love held no privilege they did not own ,
A sudden music spins great webs of sound
The difficult , and softens the severe ;
Passing the hues and objects of the world ,
While our sports shall be seen
Ah , quick her tears are springing ,
Their force embodied in a tide they pour ;
He bent against it as the water raced --
All comes to an end , however ,
Hundreds of brazen throats shoot forth afar
As the too brief mountain sunshine flies ,
Scrubbed till it shone , the day to grace ,
And something told me father 's heart was broke ,
That caught a crooked mouse --
They pour their souls in prayer .
Which bright clouds measure high ;
But casper gives a happy shout ,
Take a breath , and toss the ball
Best of the good , with me be led
Thus he made his mystic sayings :
We have brought news .
Word they gave me overhead of quarry newly slain ,
We may borrow the wings to find the way ;
My cheek , where the blushes came and went ;
Leavened with failures , with grief sanctified ,
As mist at dawn but makes the setting brighter ;
Which circumstances made it doubly , trebly dear .
With eyes disdainful of the chains that bound ,
Like a sun-song rolled the sound .
To witness duty , not to show my wit :
I gave my dearest hope of joy to her .
The battle-cries that yesterday have led
From angry heaven your gentle boughs assail !
The brightest wit can find us ;
Where daisies in the meadow toss ,
By their toil and self-sacrifice bought .
Of all my sorrows sent by heaven and fate !
To those who hailed him , as it suited .
And glittering treachery on its forehead hung .
The unvarying rivulet onward runs :
The servant , who hath joyful tidings brought ,
God 's alchemy transforming clods to gold .
Never a heart could find .
The council breaks , the warriors rush to arms .
Still slaying , urging still the greeks to arms .
Sweet music that shall make 'em settle ;
And fear finds nothing left to mend .
The bravest , and the victory takes with ease
And crimson dew-drops trembled on the lawn ;
A cold sweat glued the shirt upon his back .
Of double edge sank all into the wound .
Comfort it can never take .
That this cup of grief may pass thee ,
Our faces show , but that is naught ;
With that the warder signs to one , that goes
A whisper rose , of most pathetic breath ,
By man 's lost hope and failing trust ,
Beyond the shades that tell us day is done
His bridge destroyed by wasting waves and wind .
The air is filled with a perfume tender ,
He has made him abbot of westminster ,
Her heart is still and leaps no more
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears ,
Loud fell the gate against the post !
What shall we care if our burdens be shifted ,
It whispered , too , that " freedom 's ark
Made the darkness blossom to asphodel .
Of hating him is all desire cut off .
Of evil race , to evil bred ,
The vigilance here placed , but such as come
Make all the light our sense receives below ;
While the mother gives him counsel ,
And a baby gave her answer ,
Now hangs as mute on tara 's walls
The god of abraham inspire revenge ?
The throbbings of my heart read well .
Into himself they instantly returned .
Was ' t venus that the strange concealment planned ,
Platter or saucer rare enough to ease his mind .
Manu , who life to mortals gave ,
Whose fame through all the regions rang .
Time out of mind erected on the frontiers
Through the fens he went rejoicing ,
But here with wonder and with joy i find ,
On which were showered the rewards of rome .
There pass , with melancholy state ,
" i hold that woman guilty of a sin ,
Larks sing -- the woodland wakes once more .
A sudden fear and trembling came ,
In signal none his steed should spare ,
" my slighted love to quick resentment turns ;
One body bore them : search the whole malign
But whence the sudden beam that shoots along ?
And shall they make of beauty their estate ,
Old priam , and this golden scepter bore
And someone cries ; and darkness falls . . .
Of the abyss -- doth not the instinct shrink ?
All the water flushed with crimson !
A mightier charm to lend its aid .
Glided through all , and raised their hollow folds .
We never took thought on occasions like these
Or caves in hills that touch the skies .
The shining waves are quick to take her part .
Black boats drag shoreward through the brine
Far and wide the tidings travelled ,
On which we have hung in disaster and glory ....
Glad , when is opened unto my need
They 've struck me as with roses .
The message of deliverance comes ,
Doubt might beget of diabolic pow ' r
Soon as the rising tide shall beat ,
Of a dead virtue , and makes other hopes ,
Drifting away behind the men . there went
My game was lost . and i met the winner
Far as the ocean god hath placed between ,
The restless surge . eternal love doth keep ,
Strange that harsh thoughts should make such heavy cheer ,
Then up she took her little crook ,
Why he never took a rest ,
Piercing the secret purport of my speech ,
Spring and daisies came apace ;
't is love that makes the heavens shine
Put chains of darkness in his way .
Might akin to us be reckoned ,
As the springs to meet the sunshine ,
The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly :
There we lay the many tokens
And question mixed with prayers i made thereof ,
Streaming with blood came the blind face of kit ,
And made it his abiding-place .
With that , stern ajax his long silence broke ,
In which obscurity has wrapped them up ,
Yet still he burned to disobey ,
And watch the waves run inward from the sky
A joy that sheds its sunshine everywhere ;
The fairy clocks strike their inaudible hour
Staggering to take the pledge of brotherhood ,
The winding caverns echo to the sound .
Had delved a grave within the sands .
To intellectual , give both life and sense ,
The heavens his choice forgot ;
And all that passed aboard them . rome herself ,
And all thensforth eternall peace shall see
Then shall it go to cruel beaks ,
Upward from chin to nose my finger laid .
Old christmas is come for to keep open house ,
The news was brought to edinburgh ,
( either name you may give as you please )
Fame is not silent , here in hope to find
Little white crow gave a terrible shout ,
Of the happy days that followed ,
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high .
It makes me mad to see what men shall do
Is there no magic granted by the great spirit
And could we pierce to-day the blue
The rose 's fair luxuriance sung ;
And gave to hospitality its due !
To the rapture thy kiss can impart ,
And they unto their fortunes change to tosse .
And such good courage to my heart there coursed ,
Yet still he wore his placid smile ,
High will it hold its forehead a long while ,
The monarch , rooted to the place ,
From out cologne there came three kings
When summer 's breath their masked buds discloses :
Of court or council , where they drew
Go back as far as sums 'll carry .
Suppression of the glee , that pursed and scored
So it went lavishing beauty and pity ,
This winter 's weather it waxeth cold ,
Only suffering makes them clever .
Impervious clouds concealed thy sullen rays ;
She lay among the fiends forlorn .
Even now my ruth is fed by memory .
Which by the feet of cato once was pressed .
And come next hour to look .
Upon the love that bloomed in eden .
Make it a rule that virtue shall be praised ,
Turn to your sleeping ,
While thunder roars , and lightning round him flies .
No art she knows , or seeks to know ;
About my bet i feel no trepidation .
And looked on love as life achieved .
Of cloud whose verge rose visibly .
Which built the very cells of me to resist
To meet the wintry season .
When out of passion spent thick incense steams ,
Thou art alone the one from whom i took
On that confusion which thy death has made :
To make a heaven for love to sigh in ,
Trees there renew their fruit every month . ]
That julia , foremost , does this isle engage ,
Ambrosia _ love returned . _
Full many grades the man can reckon ,
The year in , and clashing in concord around ;
Shall level with the plain in ashes lie :
About it hugged , which quaint richness sheathed
For so the will did run .
Till the sun and moon changed places ,
Dead in the field among thick grass them threw .
It is a sunshine mixed with rain ,
Today , our passion drowned in beauty ,
Though lost in the desert he surely would find me
The mind was well informed , the passions held
Then a humour more great took its place
This little handful lost . for me , should fate
Such beauty i no more may find !
When faith is lost , when honor dies ,
Thy haughty forehead wore ,
And all the landscape wears the look of woe .
And to their ancient channels bring their streams ,
The noble friend whom to the tomb he bore .
And dismal ruin seems to threaten it . "
Pressed the mob in fury .
The cross of truth to bear ,
Who knows ? here where his ancient kings held sway
Full seven years remained ; he castles took
Fails to allay the tumult in his blood .
The tides of lust that swell the boiling veins ;
And nature prompted man to shun a wound ,
People in love can not be won by kindness ,
But the knight 's sad thoughts enchain him --
Freighted with music , came this song --
And lifted the waves of the troubled deep ;
Whence there sprang all lovely flowers ,
They softly dipped in mild oblivion 's lake ;
Of every beauty grow in power ascending ,
" adown the dreadful glacis madly borne ,
The great coat which covers all .
Has that dull innocence been punished as it should ?
Mingled with arch simplicity ,
The tall trees stood in the sunlight
" this potent stuff , if managed well ,
Great planets that are drawing near the sun
The wind smote with its flail
The letter sent , as honest dad directed .
Their beauty might declare :
At morn both flourish bright and gay ,
The day spring of glory hath visited thee ,
The old priest followed on his trace ,
Send thy messiah forth ; the time is come .
Assuredly that set those boards askance
They falter and slip from sight .
-- scarce give they time in their unruly haste
The glory of their blooms unfold ,
Their anger speaks accumulated wrong .
His lukewarm soul hath tainted and undone ;
Be sure of this . with rage was mapped
To beare aboard his most victorious fraught :
While all my thoughts on him are set
And to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept .
Revived nature takes a second breath ;
Now had the greeks eternal fame acquired ,
All these charms have hither come ,
Or sweeps the long-neglected floors ,
I followed in his train against that law 's
Wherever a wish may stray ;
As she sinks from the light of the sun
Across the blue and the low small clouds it moves
And the ninefold locks that hold it . "
That sadly played around
What new fate has overcome thee ?
The tears of night have left it wet .
And now the stars are bending slowly
And take it as thine arrows ' nest :
Shrill peals that waver and crack and break .
The lightning flashed across the land
If changing empires rose or fell ;
The wall stood flawless far as eye could reach .
That brought into this world a world of woe ,
The threads of smoke that rise above the town ;
Mature each growth the spring has wrought ,
Ráma these hasty words addressed :
Which shows a distant prospect far away
A great grey sea was running up the sky ,
Or cushioned chairs produce a race destined to dominate ?
The grave said to the rose .
Steel could the works of mortal pride confound ,
Who gave thee life , respect her sisters now .
Now no christmas brings in neighbours ,
And where the azure river 's currents roam .
And down he lays his weary bones .
Safe in the love of heaven , an ocean flows
Such was the look the palace wore
And the sound shoots across the rain hatchings ,
When they have journeyed through a world of cares ,
This day revives within my mind what she
While thy notes fluttered in our happy midst .
With springtime 's calling the pulses thrill ;
Go , make thine entrance at her lofty gates ,
And the hawk at once made answer :
' a power which comes and goes like dream ,
May gain the peace with freedom that they seek ;
Love gives itself , but is not bought ;
At the fifth hour , darkness took the throne ;
He waste chaos doth inherit ;
He links all nations while he serves his own .
Some swiftly to the king the news convey .
And down this hill it kited .
Wisely and well has providence assigned
For his face it shone with beauty ,
Thy lofty soul piercing all shows of sense ,
But life shall on and upward go ;
No farther seek his merits to disclose ,
For where two highways ran before ,
Amended and laid the base of heaven true ;
To fill our laps with all the luscious things
And view great pictures that such prices hold
There rose an awfu ' battle .
Let our enemies go by their old dull tracks ,
Shall give release from sin and crime .
And contentment 's a blessing which wealth never won .
Should these classes mix together .
Where phosphorescent lanterns flare .
" in good rinaldo equal worth shall shine ,
The lessons love can read me . " yet again
First came thy passion with o'erpowering rush ,
As i went suffering through the snow
“ his brother , and the lofty rank he held
Loud thunders through the forest pealed ;
Will follow and be true as he ;
Christian names of the people whom chance brings into the
For therein stands the office of a king ,
Or cheerful fields resume their green attire .
New wedlock brings new luck . thy concubine ,
And in the polar circle spread our sails :
On short december afternoons , and takes
Had counted , till the numbers failed ,
That the carcass will furnish an excellent soup ,
Its better life remains .
Wondrously welled out . the wall encompassed all
To gain their immortality .
Did mourners come in scorn ,
From signs of kindness witnessed evermore .
And here they stretch to the frolic chase ,
And years must make atonement for each transgression .
That the tumultuous waves of chaos stilled ;
The thanksgiving service would be coming on soon ,
Comes a pause in the day 's occupations ,
Till billows rage , and gales blow hard ,
There they sat like a lost pot and kettle ,
And hear the tale of joy i bring .
That i might once more reach that plain
Have faded and melted in tears !
God 's world is bathed in beauty ,
The vagabond in flowers reminded of
And the dim rippling river said softly to me ,
When the ripple round my keel flashed a warning .
A hundred voices cried , " away with him !
As if in him who read they felt and saw
From bloomy groves that round him lie .
When through it night winds gently slip adown .
It made me then attentive hark ,
These are the days when skies put on
At distance follow , as their king ordains .
There comes the spell of a magic dream ,
Their fate has brought to many a hearth .
In years that bring the philosophic mind .
With rapture hails the polar star --
As one the old fire forgets to touch .
The heavy drops drummed red and slow ,
And though nor hook nor sweeping net she bore ,
" lost ! lost ! for that perilous music !
Upon it hangs a curse for all its fruit :
And treads where dangers all his steps pursue ;
( there they alike in trembling hope repose , )
Ere it can climb to shine upon my face .
Thy mercy follows all my steps ,
Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes , that stood
What made sleep flutter his wings and part ?
On men the yoke that man should never bear ,
The treacheries his seed should undergo ;
With all sails set .
My heart would find the years more lonely here
There came a viewless trouble in the air ,
Then will your mind be so well braced ,
His hat rolled away , and his spectacles broke ,
And valor 's task , moved slowly by ,
The palm and may make country houses gay ,
But age comes on ; with sudden shock
Nor could his mother funeral unguents shed ;
Fly to the beaujon , and there seek relief
Sweetly , sweetly blew the breeze --
But in these rhymes is always given
Promise now sought fulfillment , -- it was time ;
There trees , and intermingled temples rise :
Dyed in the smoke they took on either side
And , seen through friendship 's atmosphere ,
From whose free notions modern freedom flows ,
Wrung the immoral song his virtue to attest ?
Each breeze brings scents of hill-heaped hay ;
And strength transmitted from sire to son .
That i may show my laughter and my light -
Than from my heart his face and memory fade .
Let nothing interpose to break that thought ,
To roses , so your roses turned to bread ,
Now let hearts shrink from scythes that drink
When thermodon with bloody billows roll 'd :
They take the advantage , agonizing christ
August on a throne which no ages can move ,
Tangled in the haze
For death from sin no power can separate .
If this belief from heaven be sent ,
Some day we 're bound to sight the enemy ,
While o'er her head sweet clouds of incense rolled
The azure skies that bend above his loved
The state is wrecked and tempest-tossed ,
The faith he spoke he never broke :
This one sits shivering in fortune 's smile ,
His shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound ;
Loved for that valour which preserves mankind .
May have their faith renewed .
And kings the forehead on his threshold drew --
We 'd recover the thing we had lost .
Of bliss that trembles on the verge of pain ,
Faith prays more fervently for love than light ;
Its dear face buried in its cloudy hands ,
All that your pity protected ,
Like to a good old age released from care ,
The powers of nature in me , lest they run
And give me the comfort of a living thing .
Lips that , curled with scorn and pride ,
With whom thy spirit hath communed so long ,
Where silence hushes discontent ,
Following his conqueror 's receding steps .
And the wind swept down with the blinding rain ;
But salomon packed his heart with dreams
So that they soon a larger house must make .
Black houses crush the creeping beggars down ,
The scene may fade that gave them birth ,
That she may share my pomp and power ;
The tenuous , vibrant chords that smite ,
To blasts from every storm that roars around .
A baltic brig will tak ' the tide
The reeds shall tell you what the poet fears ,
Doth promise joy and grace .
The clouds were scudding fast
Did somebody give you a pat on the back ?
And that dread night i singly stood for thee ?
Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight ,
While the maidens listed the woodman 's measure ;
Not even when red war swept through the land --
Strive in thy humble sphere to shine ;
The new commandment given to men ,
And would his latest hour which now drew nigh ,
An ' makes me whisper like a frightened kid .
The mother 's eyes beamed with delight .
Make haste to bring your wares to light ! "
Because by glad estate thine anger stirred ,
The hills take colour , and the valleys sing .
And as thy shade will follow thee . ”
From out her hollow hand she spills
Or give me strength enough to bear
Through those old woods a path was made ;
Follow thy bell 's sweet ringing !
The moonlight heaven , shall to his blood restore
True love only grows ( they tell me )
Each thinks he draws immortal breath .
Oh that a song would sing itself to me
Your cheeks i 've furrowed with sad tears ,
While his strained bowstring made a sound
I see the flame of freedom burn , --
That leads to truth through pleasure 's flowery way !
This makes her love so glowing and so tender ,
Christianity from the charge brought against it by the
Where helice and hyperesia lie ,
But counter to his hopes the battle went ,
Hast thou found place at the great knees and feet
Summer , summer , that came drifting through
' in fields of glory he such progress made ,
Your statements usually hold more or less .
Give her not genius . spare her the cruel pain
Panting , and pale , the herald urges speed :
My traffic does not ask such tolls .
His beauty more & more continuall doth arise ,
For things divine allow no share or part .
Sometimes the snow lies thickly ,
( the town , in those days , mostly lay
Our eyes were drawn together , and the hue
In single fight thy strength will try . ”
And in themselves seek virtue ; and to themselves
" the news of the battle came next day ;
Why would you meet old ocean 's roar ?
Nor weary hands be crossed in sleep ,
Which the rays fell upon
The stain that on thy virtue lies ,
North , keep the clouds that flush the west ,
Twas as a world were waiting there --
And in words like these addressed them :
" too gay your hearts to feel like mine ,
For peace . alone he can not compass it .
A fitting proffer has been made anew ,
The stealthy steps that stole about
In wrath , the heavenly mansion shook ;
Has set your feet upon the lie ,
His heart went back to its simplicity
I beg , as they pass . "
The clouds in woe hang far and dim ;
Should serve the strivings of a widening age ,
So latmos shone when phoebe left the chase ,
It will add to our enchantment ,
The middle of the hearth she took ,
Reaching to heaven , where it swells and breaks
You would seek in married life ,
Who feels not , when the spring once more ,
As rain beats down the bright , proud sea ,
A shadow passed across the moon .
" a barrier that no human force might break .
I find the haven of the heart of song :
Or dost thou give the winds afar to blow
To breathe the air his boyhood knew ;
Deep waters crossed life 's pathway ;
While the glorious shout swept sounding ,
May each heart be bounding ,
What mattered now the gloomy , lowering skies ?
Until the kingdom , with no guiding hand ,
Gives forth a hideous crash with bang and boom .
That i should fall into a monster 's power .
Though i but shed a rhyme for her
To light our way and bring us nearer god .
Giver of all that crowns our days ,
Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions ,
In corn , full payments to be made .
Reproach is infinite , and knows no end ,
From him the grace : through her it stands
A spirit which with these would find a home ,
First please to turn to god mercurius ;
Thy sacrificial wine we press ;
Last night the angel of remembrance brought
What more of joy can compass us around ?
And gathered the grime of the linotype crew .
At length some mistrust of this coin got abroad ;
And this has come day 's sober light ?
With the eye 's spirit running forth to meet
Deep in whose thoughtful breast thy godhead lies !
The lime hath stripped to the cold ,
The good the wise have sought ,
So they led happy lives .
It shall redden the hills when june is nigh .
Within my heart , although it wound me sore ;
The feast is spread through england
And kept it through a hundred years of gloom
To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow :
But over him a drowsiness was cast ,
Out over the gardens came the sound of some one
Their pretty bower made such a light of day .
And what the pledge the ladye gave ? --
And the waves assailed the vessel ,
When summer comes again ,
Take home a smile ; forget the petty cares ,
She trimmed the lamp , and made it bright ,
Your vasty vault but simply shows
From going straight into the hands of the devil .
' twill take your thoughts and sink them far ,
Cauld blew the bitter-biting north
We keep one watch for one same face
The home-pressed question of the age can find
Perhaps some virtuous blushes ; let them go .
To hard oppression bend the prostrate knee ,
It is that god should knit two souls ,
Shall we tell how in the time gone by ,
Of death took silently the sunrise on .
Urged the most eloquent to tell their grief .
Them simple joys that passed an hour away --
Then i wrenched from my soul a wild glory
And make on him the trial of their ferocity .
Comes a pause in the day 's occupations
And did with noble virtues shine , }
Lips that give not
Could make no answer to her glorious eyes :
Smouldering in the darkness lies ,
Enlarged winds , that curl the flood ,
Is sighing , that it virtue may acquire
My comfort in her love shall dwell ,
In the transgression lies the penalty ;
Of sun-rays tipped with death has borne ?
That soon shall hold us in its dreamless bed ,
Nor any herb sprung on its molten sand .
The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal ,
Its sorrow out or it will break !
Should precede my trust .
Stilled by love 's fancies possessed .
Nor quell the feelings which arise
Thou make of her whose wasted youth is spent
Next would i court my liberty ,
Fresh breezes blew , and sunbeams strayed ,
The fragrance rises like a breath of myrrh ,
The ballad bold and breezy comes particularly easy --
Hence then , and evil go with thee along
Since reason not impossibly may meet
So each saved other , each for other 's wrong
So , plunged in xanthus by achilles ’ force ,
The path of falsehood learned to tread .
Ages will come and go ,
Trees in each street gay lamps to bear .
Some by old words to fame have made pretense ,
Fortune changed made him so ,
Weareth that form , which influence of the soul
They sink to restful slumber .
Her little head went round for joy ;
His bursting passion into plaints thus pour 'd :
We stuck , nor breath nor motion ,
Trodden in vain till he regain the path .
With throbs her vernal passion taught her , --
He had reached a frightful precipice ,
No knowledge taught by unrelenting years ,
See those cherries , how they cover
Because thy name moves right in what they say .
And shine so rich through the ruins of time
The hundred wakeful eyes of argus bound ;
Which from the della pera took its name !
And shall in time go under to disaster .
Upon his eyes death spread his misty cloak ,
Which rises higher than the moon ,
This night again , one lay resembling him ;
To tread the humble paths of earth .
_ your sorrow is come to an end . _
Leaped aside , the stroke fell on the plain .
Than the sweet summer zephyr which breathes over slaves !
O let him feel the evil he hath done ;
That those who would keep love must dwell apart .
Should scan such secret truth ; for he had learnt
( the old dutch clock it told me so ,
To ease the hardships of the labouring poor ;
You talk of wondrous things you see ;
Still may those hosts their first great plan pursue ,
One , driven by strong benevolence of soul ,
And toil rebuilds what fires consume !
Their song is death , and makes destruction please .
All seemed to rise with spirits somewhat higher
Has he not seen how you your favour place ,
To the chaste sun my guilt proclaim ,
And blow away my dust and scatter
And wasted all the purpose of my youth .
Where long buried are the joys
Such lonely walks were made .
The wheeling earth , the marching sky , --
Tearing away the veils i wove
I told it not , my wrath did grow .
As if it felt the sanctity within .
Then he saw the truth most clearly ,
The prince whose merits grew , acquired
I feel refreshed and recommence my labours ,
Trot , trot , the baby goes ,
Each thought divides the absent from my lot .
It chanced the lord of battles came
As forth from athens went hippolytus ,
That from its wall rude passing clowns have thrown .
They touch our country and their shackles fall .
It beat for france and for america ,
While the dry bottom israel 's armies trod ,
And now there came both mist and snow ,
No sound of thunder fell upon my ear ;
To give me comfort and relieve my pain .
But mourning quickly followed mirth ,
The same moon lit them through the watchful night ;
Bearing our joys away , and bringing woes .
When death has reft their crown . "
Of utter weariness they trod . by day
And the still billows holy silence keep .
And all its finer inspiration caught ;
Years may be added ; should they come to thee
To save thy soul from infinite distress ,
And left me to pursue my path alone .
And ever this cry the heart was making --
A riddle made to break my heart ;
" the veil of gold must lose the prize ;
I feel that in my inmost heart .
There is no wind to stir the leaves ,
Wilt thou slay duty and give back the beauty
Has not lorenzo 's bosom caught the flame ?
Where all the world 's lost treasure lies .
Give every one the lie .
From spiritual toils set free ,
What god or fortune would assist his might .
And they made a molten image ,
Therefore my breast made common to his mouth
Ulysses , and with him might few compare .
Down on earth their milk ran over ,
Methinks when thy sweet form was made
( that even for anger makes the lily pale ,
And now what lands between us lie ,
Disperse the sad reflections as they rise ;
The artist 's decorations , well express .
Tapers lit at feet and head ,
As balmy sleep had charmed my cares to rest ,
But more the goddess made the place divine .
I feel a sacred pleasure warm my breast
But i was taken by that air of cold
For all this came a ruin : side by side
Inditing letters filled with love ,
When she awoke she found it a joke ,
Heard his words , and then made answer :
Its shadow on his head is laid .
Full of songs loud mirth takes pride in ;
No death ensued , no blood was dropped ,
The scents that swing where lilies lie ,
And fell into a feverish slumber .
A dazzling memory revive ;
When now the sun had seville left behind .
The gay who find aught to wake laughter ,
The sweet song died , and a vague unrest
The wind is roaring ; the rushing rain
Some pious tears the pitying hero paid ,
And put an end to all this foolish fuss
It will ride the waves in beauty ,
At evening come unto the joys that wait ,
The glad ones often give a glance ,
Lo , the darting bowling orb !
They lift no arm upon a world defaced
Personal acknowledgment is also made to the following poets and
And irony and satire off me throw .
Restrain ’d great hector , and this counsel gave :
Should fortune smile , your company they 'll crave ,
Goes out in sorrow , even while i know
In the very words which follow :
Unceasing tears they shed ;
With shouts they bear -- a miserable sight ! --
Through my chamber wall thy ship hath passed . ”
That makes her beautiful beyond the reach
Who culled a garland from the flowers of song
And turn the mournful to the cheerful strain ?
The storm came on before its time :
There was held the famous strife ;
Sever from self , and occupy with thee !
And slumbering resolution woke .
To dream of something more than this i see ?
In distant threats he braved the goddess-born .
He suffers who gives surety for the unjust :
Were echoed in heaven by lips like her own .
Such as saints might feel above .
With so much order made , there can be none
Where the lily leans o'er an amber stream
They took no note of time , nor cared
And kept the ascetic vows i made ,
Of retribution fiercely works in me . "
Silver stars shine peacefully ,
And they swear they 'll support our laws ;
_ of true devotion monkish temples share _
And which not more than six miles distant lay .
For her dull ears are tuned to other themes ;
A favour claims return as this world goes .
Then in him time shall run
What love and laughter taught me to be blind ;
France goes rolling all around ,
Which would vainly strive to tear
Against the thoughts of man ; he turns to flight
This fight demands the slaughter of a world .
So saying the hero went , and as he strode
Of a moment o'erlooked is eternity lost .
As the swift seasons roll !
Bring it me , old father .
Let 's cut the poem into two !
Join issue , and proceed to trial . _
When answer made the love that was therein :
To sacred troy , where all her princes lay
And find forgiveness where the shadows stir
A few are left to struggle on ,
How gushed the life-blood of her brave --
The two men glared as tigers glare ,
Forth went shingebis , the diver ,
In making the acquaintance of a friend of robinson .
And his drooped head sinks gradually low --
To roll with pleasure in a sensual sty .
Her portrait in all stature stood ,
Let others such opinions hold ,
Swell the gay notes , the airy dancers glide ;
Where they their blessed hours both save and spend .
From the shame that beset me ,
By ephraim 's prophet made to live again .
One grief which nothing can destroy ,
The red flowers hang like a heavy mist ;
A little she began to lose her fear ,
There the huge sirloin reeked : hard by
A picture for my heart to keep .
And white clouds fly towards the northern strand ;
Of retribution fiercely works in me . "
When earth takes home this wandering dust again ,
But life shall on and upward go ;
_ winds are calling in rain and mist . _
Within these stars that round about them go .
Reproach you , saying all your force is gone ?
His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare ;
And drained thy health in the honey dew ;
The souls of a thousand lay stilled .
When the accounting comes , how shall i pay ?
As i stand now , with pulses beating blood .
The baffled gaze -- the unbroken shadows fall .
Such chance to lose gives pain .
The smoky ringlets rise ,
They made us of our pathway confident .
The lips repose our love has kissed : --
Her downward rays the silver moon shall shed . "
She feels , with all our furniture ,
Homeward the heart will then return .
Till grief had turned the heart to stone ...
As the swift seasons roll !
With wondrous art founded the massy ore ,
This name is borrowed from the name of the sacred
The love that kept the quiet hearth ,
Now poising fair the hours of sleep and day
But age will beat us all in time .
Old time will make thee colder ,
A melancholy murmur gave .
The agony how high they pile ,
Weighed down beneath his whelming grief ,
To take the mount by easier ascent . "
Their beauty might declare :
Wheel that black horse -- give sam a clout .
Fate gave , what chance shall not control ,
And vain pretense , unnoticed , goes its way .
Prince edward lived , and money made and spent ;
Farewell , -- could wishing weave a spell ,
The general april of the world doth come
And she has set young bicham free .
To sounds of chimes that sing across the mist .
Searching and sad ; my mind is stuffed with words
No thought that comes unclad in gold
Is not expressed by suns alone ,
Mere matter of the fancy , now hath grown
There 's a marker , made to show
Casting away light wreaths on playful waves ;
A little thing to flatter and make weep ,
Until we reach the town of sleep .
Of every servant which that served her .
How often have my glances pierced the taut ,
Who loved thee , now that death sets free
Another life , from our light passion lit ,
All saving health , and help for me .
To catch my thief , and then like vermin here
While ancient thunder shakes the modern world .
Though it have brought destruction on the world .
Her tongue pour 'd forth its ready store
There stood man 's enemy .
" i take thy courtesy , by heaven ,
And none could swear it went not empty down
Till spent and failing , in his heavenly scorn ,
Our spirits yearn to feel thy kindling love ;
Time steals from love !
May catch the fool who turns to stare ;
And opals like the wistful winds that blow
Fancy hath tamed her fairy gleams ,
As the car went lumbering through ,
The truth of which none are inclined to doubt ,
For sin had rendered unto her
To that high home of thunder whence it came .
Years , years must pass before again i view
O jane , what sadness fills the mind
The altar shed a stream of gore .
Just as the darkness closes down .
That envy should not reach it with her eye ,
But strife remains ; fear and the human heart ;
With desultory fury borne along ,
And we that wear its evil form , alarm ,
He ended , and his speech found no reply .
The germans drain 'd their wide domain for me ,
Christmas comes but once a year ,
The train like lightning flew .
And in the comment did i find the charm .
So that none can read the legend
" make way for liberty ! " they cry ,
For his star it shineth clear .
My savings made as lecturer and writer
Beneath which lay a bath of water fair ,
He landed a fortune in stakes and in bets ,
Adopted ; and the statute put in force .
With meek surprise did lift their heads
Which seeks and points out ev'ry flaw ;
Was rest still broken by the vain
Of mercy caught , did not expire ;
Her office holds ; of all external things ,
Because i was not near to make them sad
In sunlike sheen it flashed and blazed ;
While young sir guy poured forth a glittering hoard
A picture drawn from life , austere and dark ,
' whose long progression leads to deity .
One day he lay within the pleasant woods
Low it lay in embers red ;
' that soul had left a devil in its room
Which told how deeply he was hurt and pained .
And leave the generous flames to shape themselves .
As flying fish took wing ; the breakfast passed ,
Then forth she drew me , and all dripping brought
Which none secure from injury may pass .
Which the kindly spirits bore them ,
Of the flaming death that threatened .
They still return to that one hour of bliss ,
Bring life back again to me .
With her , the enchanter friar the pirates bore
That pressed about each cave and rill .
I listened and i thought i caught the word --
When night comes trailing her starry cloak ,
And pass his days in peace among his own .
But , alas ! there comes the sorrowful thought ,
Which should have filled the world with flame ?
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
To spend the day alone .
What thrilling tumults in his bosom came
With his lost dreams when summer days wane dim ?
Which declares that the wicked expand like the palm
Of aventine spread oft a lake of blood .
Nor is the end long stayed .
Set my untutored heart ablaze .
When the stream begins to leap .
But what black boreas wrecked her ? he
My eyes o'erflow with tears which show
That till seven years are past and gone ,
That filled his soul with faith in god .
That mercy i to others show ,
And then his smile did follow unawares ,
And nature loom 'd more large through the unknown .
Reddening the road and deepening the green
Shall murmur by the hedge that skirts the way ,
But a little time passed over ,
In hopes to yield her mirth .
The firmament breaks up . in black eclipse
Like amaranthine flowers , feel no decay ;
Her glorious fancies come from far ,
Still as the utmost depths of ocean keep --
Only by love is life made real ;
The time you give to converting me ;
A burning forest shut the roadside in
How short a space our worldly joys endure !
Has come to be a shrine ,
Is held an ultra consultation --
The sudden shine sent from the livid east scene ;
Unconscious that his love in grief 's embrace
And her voice of music sinks to a sob ,
And full and lustily he blew .
Not to lose pity pitiless became .
Which rises from a heart that lives in grace ;
Wind-cuffs that dodge the laughing grass ;
It will give a rest to me .
" open thy bosom to the truth that comes .
Making the blood strain back from their blanched faces
Unto the depths from heights celestial thrown .
A man most clings absorbed , or what the affairs
Whose dying shrieks on the night air are shed .
Its boundary stone that clings so deep in time .
The fable which i now present ,
That i in earth my honoured king may lay :
What joyful rite the morn will see .
I own my faithlessness and guilt ;
Your sacrifices , stained with gore ,
Where willows shake their watery-sounding leaves .
To chase the fiend , and win the prize ,
A blithesome boy this picture shows ;
Let burning streams run through her veins ;
That will not yield unto her formes direction ,
So he then quickly gave it chase ,
Had turned our parish topsy-turvy ,
And subtle , sad , and sweet there floats
Whose blush remains when virtue sets
For the structure that we raise ,
A touch can make , a touch can mar ;
And her eyes are fixed on the star .
So long as i live these joys will remain ,
Yet their mystic anthems came
The mood arose up in the murky east ,
For the scent is lying strongly in the morning .
The midnight phantoms feel the spell ,
Sending a thrill that hurries me along
Which sat upon olympus ; to the dust
Butted the other ; so their wrath prevailed .
Might fall a freshening storm !
Or morning gun-fire 's smoke is curling ;
And driving snow , the cottage shut the door .
To praise that fits thee , clear
But the cheerful spring came kindly on ,
With him he takes the best among his men ;
The straining arms of hercules must hold ,
Luncheon went right . the weary team
And take the lesson for the prize .
With labour light is friendship gained ,
Of dreaming sorrow ; cities rise and sink
April brings the primrose sweet ,
Then let thy virtue match the crime ,
Each goes his various , wonted way ,
There troy her ruined fortunes shall repair .
And on its plains a hundred cities stand .
And the waves rise up in anger ,
That the brook raises in the empty valley .
Which bloomed and bore striped apples by the peck
Doth heaven with all its splendors lie ;
For pain is sitting on my lover ’s brow ;
Then i drew breath ; they disappeared :
That supreme song which shook the channelled waters ,
With living sapphires : hesperus , that led
Until we reach the town of sleep .
Now he melted them to pity .
Against the gods . they shall not share alike ,
The seasons bring the fruits thou wilt not miss
To make your tears fall where your soft hair lay
And tears on those eyelids tremble like dew ,
What souls possess themselves so pure ,
Lightnings flash their vivid torchlight .
When on his altered sense the change is wrought ,
Each striveth for appearance , and doth make
Shall potent through the world be found ,
That kindled is by sight , blown by desire .
Remotely , plays on the misdeeming sense ,
Which have fallen in our way ;
Into the christian hands will fall enslaved ! "
You will be likely to regard as sacred
But by the french it turned was this way .
Then as his grateful reverence paid
The prince pursued the parting deity
There the hawk it came to sorrow ,
From the corn-loft brings the peasant
The mangled flesh and sinews tear ,
Are hard to bear , as hour by hour
More truth than here you 'll find ;
From preaching to an audience fired with faith
That will leave regret or rueing ,
That drew the thunder from the sky
And from my shoulder draw this bitter shaft .
Through all the air was quickly borne ,
For me the ocean lifts its solemn psalm ,
And yet , my heart arises from the dark ,
What new power now plies the shuttle ? '
Nor race nor creed shall difference make ,
From stain of patriot or of hostile blood !
On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes ,
And spent their time in work and play .
But he took no heed of the signals red ,
Our way lies where god knows
Soon as ulysses near the inclosure drew ,
The trojans see the youths untimely die ,
And clouds were swept .
Till half-another year had slipt away .
And new-born pleasure brings to happier men ;
The paltry alms that traveller threw ,
He hath traced and holds the clue ,
For sorrow walks before her ,
The tide of life turned out to sea ;
Soon as the rising tide shall beat ,
I fought the fight , endured the endless days
The proudest the world can show ;
A dead hand lies like flame upon my heart .
Hope amid the rainbow plays .
From virtue 's shield the shafts resound ,
From various climes that dire assembly came ,
For this have lost the very bloom of life ?
Too blindly have reposed my trust :
Reason the bias turns to good from ill ,
Fever stood forth : " and i appeal
Love turns aside the balls that round me fly ,
Adjacent to europe he struck up an island ,
Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers ,
Bowing to god , yet bending to no creed ,
But placed him amongst celestiall stars ,
Foliage which once hung oer the waters blue .
Shall tarry , while the battle joins . "
Queen oene 's brow darkened in sudden wrath .
Yet that fond mother praised , the world caressed ,
No joy but that to make her blest ,
And we are strong enough to bear it .
That we have drawn the lightning from the cloud
Now let thy mercy unto me be given ,
While the darkness that seems your sweet being to bound
Happy were the days we spent together !
Answered in the words which follow :
' the thwarted thirst , too faintly felt ,
He 's gotten such a fright ;
Or the wildest of sights that the hurricane woke .
And stung to death the throat that drained it ;
While their stiff bristles stand on end with ire :
At work on ruin for the days to come .
Authoritative of that elder , sprang
And purest peace in that to find .
The brook that rippled down the hill
Nor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies :
Answered in the words which follow :
_ i should love to find my soul there _
But the clouds loom dark in the angry skies
By the billow which returneth
That makes the saint or sinner .
While her solemn words are ringing ,
He pursued the never-ending
Whose circle of meridian covers o'er
With fairy lightness fell its magic gleams
To all it offered gentle shade ;
Fondly we think we honour merit then ,
One last word as he fades into a dream ;
What now remains but tears and hopeless sighs ?
Where sights of men-wrecks gasp for breath ,
No partial favour by the good is shown :
Herein doth show its most exceeding worth ,
That rest or intermission none i find .
Cast sparks of fire upon her painted face .
To keep me happy all the day .
And in the middle placed my heart . but he
And the surging waters rinse them .
But found that his genius was lazy and slow .
She who held your heart and charmed you
Cold nipping winds a lengthened winter bring ,
Boldness you 'll find an easy science ,
What shall we do when hope is gone ? "
Of my life 's warfare ever seek thy face ?
Mars shot no anger from his fatal throne ,
The statesman stand apart ,
And fists of fingers clutched a blackening wound .
Low hangs the moon , it rose late ,
When the moon no freedom gave him ,
Drawn by a dread power to the mighty work .
And in that bond has kept us true .
Driving the gloomy clouds , shake to the ground ,
That so did take eliza and our james !
Rose shrilly , filling all the air with cheer .
They fill the mind with thoughts impure ,
The place it reached to blackened instantly .
My long lost treasure i regain . "
Ever had laid on head and heart and hand --
Evil genius , thee i banish ,
Nor echo the whispers that made my heart swell
Of linked sweetness long drawn out ,
Full quick the tidings run .
For mordecai the sceptre holds
I could not hear the laughter that they made .
He kept it for the warrior ’s need :
And every flower that sad embroidery wears :
What towns in war he levelled to the ground ,
The limp figure of sweeney took on something
Hot lightnings lash the skies and frightening cries
And it gave accord .
Here no vain phantoms lead the soul astray ;
Benign , and of our merit take no count .
Who stood before me , lost in pained surprise .
Deep in my soul can stir the springs ;
Wits must unite : for ignorance , we see ,
Fierce lustres mingled in a fiery haze .
And swift had sprung the arrow ,
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Him the muses love to follow ,
From the darkness came a whisper ,
Their baleful zeal had come about ,
That had little of life save its weight :
Shame , tearless grief , and stifling wrath ,
The thoughts which roll within my ravish 'd breast ,
Love has well touched with the desire of me ,
When next the morning warms the purple east ,
Fidelity and innocence are found
Rough passage , then , and perilous he found .
The kingdom of heaven he takes by violence ,
And the beds but two could hold ;
Whence comes it save from fortune setting free
The 5th stanza is as follows :
Round and round they came and flashed towards heaven :
As the tide comes tumbling in .
Only makes the fool more foolish . "
Sparkles instruction ; such as throws new light ,
Before her eyes rose up the house of gold ,
He kept so closely locked in my embrace ,
Where the worlds hang growing in clustered shapes
Her office holds ; of all external things
While service , by affection wrought ,
The long night dies : the welcome gray
Till it reached a town in the distant north ,
He strikes with words that are like poisoned arrows
And , by their wild dominion led ,
By fear oft shifted , as by fancy brought ,
The glory of the moon beset .
Confused soft clouds of music fled above me .
The woody wild his heart possessed ,
But when the seasons following in their train ,
All kept the joyous holiday .
Foaming waves leapt up to meet it ,
He knows who gave that love sublime ;
Innumerable , follow . ' mid the plain
I catch the glances of a sea
A royal coward fills britannia 's throne ;
In which the zephyr breathes the loudest song ,
Those wandering veins of heavenly blue ,
His clear eye dimming as it swept
Lone wandering , but not lost .
" to my unhappy pulse , that beat right through
Of blackness whence no light could issue forth .
All that my soul remembers
Languid with music . then a step drew near ,
Its bridle with modesty leading . "
He laid his armor by and sought his rest .
More softly than the dew is shed ,
Each morning , and when night drew near ,
Now they hurl the storm of war ,
And follow death the way my fancies went
And when a chance for stealing came ,
But soon a scream made him arise :
When armageddon thunders thro ' the land ;
Sweet music that shall make 'em settle ;
Amidst the flood his form he throws ;
And brought disaster to our race ;
Thou canst make sorrow beautiful , and steal
Of pines upon their wide roots poised ,
Yet i do n't fight with shame for it --
And presently he took a nap
Yet on one point she felt anxiety :
So loud the roar which chilled with fear ,
Find sudden calm beneath this thought :
What wondrous prize has kindled this career ,
For a young wife has he taken
Strange questions clutch me , thrusting fiery arms ,
Graves bring forth , and at his menace dread ,
Harshly as love 's imperial cause allowed .
That strive to drown the voice of pain ,
An instinct within it that reaches and towers ,
When the sun went away .
From wintry lives blue eyes will turn .
But hers , which through the crystal tears gave light
To lead the israelites into the land
To drive the cold winter away .
Near the flood that runs by the river wall .
That chastity shall take no harm .
It speaks of war not peace ;
In passing ages all the form was gone :
Abode his destined hour , and went his way .
I 'll ask , nor give offence without intent ,
Said in a tone whose anguish would have riven
Here and there the fire has caught him ,
To feel the flowing wind !
But goes the highest road which brings to bliss .
His armor gently the knights divest ;
The trembling mark at which their arrows fly .
Then sank the shouts and again we heard
And friendly hand in hand was set .
Go where glory waits thee ,
Swift to her dome the goddess held her way .
How does the emperor take his tea ?
Was seized with symptoms of such deep decline ,
And round with anxious glances sought ,
" now i take the tongue of otso ,
Nor even own his haughty reign ,
That oft brings me disgrace ,
Must build the fire and sweep the floor .
For love can comment upon every woe .
Thoughts that breathe , and words that burn .
And fists of fingers clutched a blackening wound .
Wher so as evere his love go ;
Upon the scarce-touch 'd billows float ,
And take us as a single soul . "
The soul of him to hell live devils took .
The roses turn to the sun 's warm sky ,
And fast her pen and fingers fly ,
The road that winds to the city gate .
He fought amidst heart-rending groans ,
And form the costly feast with busy care .
Time sped . and the poet through sorrow
The flames of life do burn --
Are but the dwindling past he can recall
And it widens all his heart ,
A captive victor that hath lost in gain ;
What says the body when they spring
That breaks away and runs ; a cruelty ,
And what life that we shall lede .
Kind love both give and get . only what word
Of the happy days that followed ,
With her , to meet the blast of war ,
The ruddy crested camp-fires shot ,
To boundless vengeance the wide realm be given ,
Her melting air , at every breath we draw ,
Such a blow might make mine heart faint .
Where church was left , to churches ran ,
It will give him fresh spirits for battle and slaughter
The morning comes ere darkness goes .
Rather than sate his ill desire , to die .
Intrench 'd before the town both armies lie ,
And through a rainbow woven of human tears
This is the garden : colors come and go ,
And challenges the peace of every land .
There from whence envy first did let her loose .
From whom the lure for ever slips
Passions strong my art doth see .
The other , thrice they sprang to the assault ,
As fast as oars could pull and water float ;
To what i feel is lord of all ,
Perforce i follow italy . "
Following his fancies o'er these lonely hills ,
When nothing that asks for bliss ,
Bliss of thy birth shall quicken me ;
When you into my arms it gave ,
Who went to battle forth and always fell .
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice ,
Here my chaste muse a liberty must take --
In its bright embrace . baths were there then ,
So peacefully their rest they take ,
But most , the brothers of the arm which made
And mourn to see the fickle love they owed ,
't is easier far a wreath to bind ,
Until the day waned low , and shadows tall
And a wind arose and blew the imps
Beats down his loathsome breath to hell .
Sudden and loud , oppressing what it feeds ,
We swung our way through flying men ,
But _ shuddering _ and _ trembling _ stand .
Scornful he spoke , and o'er his shoulder flung
To make and store up happiness ,
Or cheerful fields resume their green attire .
And dire the discord langside saw ,
A sound came from the land ;
And melancholy caves return the sound
" in happy chains our daring language bound ,
And fast they follow , as we go
Untamoinen bears the saying ,
Was more than heaven had destined to his friend .
And the heavenly dream of her soul makes gleam
Shall call an answer down from heaven !
Where night was reddened by the drudging fires ,
Wherever life in sacrifice is poured ,
By a thousand years rolling about .
The knight made a bow more profound than before ,
A sweet exhaustion seems to hold
To punish these , see jove himself descend .
For to the time when life shall pass away
Where music grows , and beauty is unchained .
To feed oblivion with decay of things ,
And what 's the creeping breeze that comes
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high .
What could he see but mightily he noted ?
To seek his brandimart that lord had made ,
To mend the news of this funeral priest ,
Of the landscape lying so far below ,
The veil so long and black she throws .
On the death she might not share .
That fare the new-born christ to see :
Their wonted fruit should bear ,
Till he had cast the shadow from his soul ,
Or backers take the bet ,
Sich fine circumstances ort to make us satisfied ;
Towards the virtue still which followed me
Joy of her beauty ran in him so hot ,
But those passionate eyes speak true , speak true ,
Of sovereign love , and song began to flow .
Had i possessed what i held dear ?
A settled sorrow sate upon their brows ,
And august never comes the near .
They followed jesus in the holiness
Now love was buried ; and despair had flown
Back to those walls to mark them go ,
And gathering courage i said to my soul ,
And laid peace on the sea .
Over a day so well , so proudly spent ,
From circuit unto circuit shall be found
And there diffused its sweet perfume ,
Sparely comes it , swiftly goes ,
Twenty curious eyes stared at him ,
Nor gave the slightest opposition ,
Have slipped out of our bond , because your face
How kings and heroes rise and fall ;
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here ! --
And golden summer days uniting cheerful hearts .
Sitting alone , his bitter lips did bite . "
But doubt and fear within me rise ,
The joy of invention lived through all ,
Sleep the sleep that knows no breaking ;
My bosom now , shall somewhat less be felt .
Where swains contented own the quiet scene ,
Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword .
To laws a lawless power hath passed ;
Should lead her own to death that night .
So , took a birth afore the mast ,
And fists of fingers clutched a blackening wound .
Forbidden , for its pleasure go .
Sweet are the joys that follow on despair ,
Pass dimly forth and back , sounds heard in dream
And he mingled the threads with subtlety ,
Of holy spirit , which has been diffused
The heart of him i loved i wrung .
Broke up , shall heave the ocean to usurp
Of warm light where the bridge lay mistily .
Sleep , be still , turn to your rest
All bloodless lay the untrodden snow ;
He sees me in to supper go ,
Such mood of blessing took me , there ,
Suns rise and set , and rise , and yet
And some unbidden tears that rise
But now i see three stages in our life .
Ere sorrow lay you on your back .
She listen 'd with a flitting blush ,
But when that warrior pointed out the way :
All that the varying taste can please ;
The latter sands descend :
The city made a madman out of me ;
Where blood is dropping in the throng :
Great things ask for when thou dost pray ,
Between these two there rolls an ocean wide ;
But gave him skill to raise the lofty lay .
The trumpet flower led them all .
Ebbing , flowing , with my breath ,
Her merit . needs it now be shown ,
When age or chance has made me blind ,
Embraced and kissed the walls of that cold tower .
On my study shelves they stand ;
The wind came keen with a tang of frost ,
Their bonds whene'er some zephyr caught began
Where brandished swords flashed white , and human blood
But it brought no food nor shelter ,
And jesus calls us to heaven 's perfect peace .
Starve , freeze , and fashion verses to
With grim jaws terribly roaring ; even so
Holds all our senses in a realm of bliss ,
That keeps the world alive . if all at once
Where passing feet beat busily :
Like a wild creature tossing back her mane ,
Care be banished , patience won ;
And catch the manners living as they rise ;
Lest i fall unawares before the people ,
Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied .
Give honour to the brave
When hid by shades of dark malign
That drift out slowly when night steals the day ,
Such kisses as belong to early days ,
That their flames beget that rain ;
Nor suffer it to spread . from foaming mouth
To nature 's revolution learn to yield :
Of mountains , where the stream spurts out its tide
Made nations tremble , and whole hosts retire ,
An ' night creeps stealthily to gain the ring .
Whose purer flames tremble to be soe nigh ,
And a sable cloud its shadow throws ;
Her words gave the good warriors sorrow and discontent .
Each angry leader panting to meet in stern debate .
Fear stifled speech and stiffened all his hair .
Where the wind flowers blow !
And a light word may ring in starry halls .
That fed the hosts of israel .
Society packed up , went away .
Wealth makes burdens , pleasure stings ,
A flattering painter , who made it his care
And riddles more , which future time must own :
Was issuing forth from ganges with the scales
Then rávaṇ hurled in deadly ire
There honour comes , a pilgrim gray ,
Within her beams wrapping his cruel stains .
To court the golden splendor of the skies , --
Life is a challenge all must meet ,
Eliab heard , and kindled into ire
To catch the fervor of his ripest ray ,
Thus strove to banish her heart 's distress : --
And like a flash the weird affection came :
' virtue has raised above the things below ;
That marked the anointed heir of david 's line .
To trial bring her stolen charms ,
And no more wrapped about with bitter dreams
Some pitying spirit downward came .
Answered in the words that follow :
Thy universe . the worlds are filled with wonder
And thy heart has kept so well .
That of its charms divests the dewy lawn ,
The face that keeps the world so fair
And should misfortune 's gales blow hard ,
And give to rapture all thy trembling strings .
Notion with notion making leagues and pacts ;
The ruin wrought by folly of her lord ,
And toss the miles aside for me .
And poured sweet comfort on their looks of woe .
The fiat fate hath spoken --
May bring familiar comforting ;
And thrice came on in fury ,
Provided it do hopeless hang ,
The fathomless pit had else swallowed it up . "
Soft reflection 's hand can trace ,
As one in slumber held . not long that mood
Where lays that never end
Turn all thy flooding music into love ,
Of empires heave but like some passing waves .
Wherein love hath full sway !
Joy reigned in heaven where every eye
Of his twelve chiefs he onward pressed ,
The mother saw destruction near ;
And sets each land free from intruding foes .
In thee alone the soul can find
The cry arose .
There fell a weary tear .
Deepened and swelled to music clear and loud ,
My mother placed me servant to a lord ,
The hawthorn bush puts on its white ,
Silence of the thunders locked ;
And we thought how coves had swung :
The moon has gone to bed ,
Death stays there . like to that fell cruel shaft
The god bad make no respit ,
" comrades , what hour has struck ?
And found that it was every dele ,
Martano now employs his lying tongue ;
There never trembles a sigh of regret ,
There would find a period :
She felt his pleased eyes read her face .
( for what scant nourishment ' twould give )
The dull neglect that marked his life
And the sun lends nuptial fire .
Long passed into the haze
Ages looked on while battling kingdoms bled .
Nurtured and fed with tales of mystery ,
Some shape come up of a demon seeking apart
The wandering bees can not bear to leave them ;
All trembling in her fear and woe .
And strangers o'er thy land their rule extend :
Make truth a lie ?
That here his hunting closes with the great :
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn ;
All else has risen in yon silvery cloud .
Dull night at length her dusky pinions spread ,
And scorning the strife that swelled
Would show his genius in some work of art
As they take the aisle ?
So i again resorted to the lore
What sound is that the silence hears ,
All that made us one blood and breed ?
The lean , athletic body , deftly planned
And left the parlor wrapped in gloom .
I give thee back the life i owe ,
There it became a voice , and issued thence
High over all are monarchs set . ”
How precious was the faith that taught
Without a word down came their blazoned flag .
Nor from the place depart , while life remained ,
Locked in grip of fratricidal war .
To bring unto others joy and mirth ,
Beneath defeat more hotly to embrace
To the unending . but for him that makes
Cheat our poor souls of good thou hast designed ;
One was the love i lost ...
Majestic moved , that served him in the place
And found him scarcely older than a child ,
He kept the sea as his own right ;
Call 'd forth the reapers ' rustling noise ,
Electric beams -- which shot in circling fans
Upon its swinging orbit over space ;
Such are the visions that fade away --
To divide the night from the day ,
And when the cannons growl around ,
But all was formed to soothe or move ,
Sorrow was there made fair ,
No force of theirs hath competence to take ;
The winds of fate will drift it far away .
An ' stops to take short naps ,
Our hero great exploits went through ;
And raving goes thus harrying other people . "
That you have left to darken and fail ,
Passing above them . unto pure devotion
Reason , god 's revelation shows to faith ,
Now mill keeps order in the land ,
Reached not the heart that courage kept
Across the gulf that stretches far beneath
He in his wrath pronounced a curse , —
To my arms their charge convey ,
To hide the fault i see ;
The violets lay , two white , one blue .
For all that lifts the fringes of the night ,
This world was difficult ; and perchance he found
Which make it death for any beast ,
There yet for riches go !
Sweet rainbow-tinted hopes , and lightly run ,
His vote had counted for the broken men ;
It cries and murmurs in my car
In the joints put finest silver ,
When the sails the breeze is filling ? "
And made her poor old bones to ache ,
And sealed his eyes with timeless dust .
As rhyme and reason passed along .
Because his love is the best thing to seek ,
Had made a comment sage and long ,
Dares it with earthly love to beat ?
The pirate ships came leaping , grim and black ,
Is it a whisper that runs through the galleries ?
And longing arms around her neck he cast ,
Rent from the walls , a rocky fragment lay ;
Active it finds , to its own substance draws ,
Watched , noting down each prayer he made ,
Of the syren-chants that swell
_ ye shy recluses , follow too ! _
At the beginning of winter a cold spirit comes ,
The life of every fiend shall take .
Like carrion puffed with noisome steam ,
Immortal fame his deathless labours gave ;
The same old black cat winked green amber eyes ;
The wind blew hollow frae the hills ,
Whoso goes to war for nothing ,
Where they want , of riches find .
Have dwelt in peace with souls subdued .
Has brought fair flowers to make an earthly paradise .
And many herods lie in wait each hour
Guilt gives them courage to maintain their fault .
Which by the changed face of my risen youth
Go , with my blessing filling both your hands ,
It downward sweeps , about us flows --
Full on his form the beacon glory fell ;
The wonted inspiration give ;
The busy fingers fly , the eyes may see
Nor this alone would have bestowed with joy ;
Slow to argue , but quick to act .
Therefore to thee it was given
So our fishing find us food ;
States fallen -- new empires built upon the old --
One furnace of confusion , heaved and seethed
Men vanquish fortune and the mightiest odds .
Gives each tired toiler rest ,
Thorough the fog it came ;
And fill 'd her kind large eyes with joy ,
That taketh sins away . their prelude still
The guarded fane where love alone may peer ,
That sealed my venture wisest ;
He his wanton eye did throw
Where spirits go , it forms a bridge ,
The grave locks up the treasure it has found ;
Thy waters run .
The poor moon seemed to faint in fright ,
To bind the loveless joyless vow ,
Since that would give me freedom from the thought .
Whence came the gold that paid for this ?
The mansions which the good obtain . ”
Wherein truth mainly lies for those who see
All gone astray after the bad example !
Of that nature , soothed and gentled ,
Their conflict , comes the peace between the pair ,
She seemed entranced and eased . could she make
A wordless woe imprinted on thy face .
Their love rose up and followed close behind .
And on the nations sheds propitious rays .
Which , though it rises over time and space ,
To give me joy the oceans roll ,
The shining way he went .
Whatever death they send shall strike me down .
And irony and satire off me throw .
In the springtime came the circus ;
I have staked with my god for truth ,
Those rock-faces hung with weed
From life to life , must still pursue
Und dey know dey gained deir cause .
Are downward cast , and filled with unshed tears .
Mars once endured much wrong , when on a time
Her arms about his neck argia threw :
Both breathing slaughter , both resolved in arms .
Content it is to give its holy smile ,
Are crushed in a hell-born strife --
I know what deed our thanks has earned ,
That grieved and doubted , it came to pass
And pay them their proportion 'd share of fame .
Pinching its ear such cries of sorrow wrung
But all my heart is drawn above ,
Woe , woe ! the curse has fallen !
Your heartbeats set the rhythm for my heart .
Still follows thee , still follows thee .
Goes seeking those that have gone astray , --
It makes me simply furious ,
" and sufferings have made pure
In the vessel placed her army ,
Hence comes the joyfulness with which i flame ,
How objects mellowed , when subdued by warmth
And fires that round her burned with ceaseless blaze ,
I saw no other way in honor left .
The sloping walks and odorous shrubs entwine
Since reason not impossibly may meet
And this is as near as lovers ever come ,
And by the world be rudely tossed ;
And taking from thy bright divinity ,
Rose-lovely lips that hover
To find if hearts be wild and wise ,
Her softest smile may wear ,
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day
To them long practice prudent foresight gave ,
Which longer than an age extends its reign .
Her mural breach , returning whence it rowld .
Thus all went on , so snug and nice ,
May catch the sense like subtle forest spells .
And their faith can never swerve .
His heart stood still , aghast with fear ;
Breaking the silence of the seas
Thus others ' talents having nicely shown ,
Onward beneath the sun following its course ,
Nothing passes for thorns to hold --
No creed hath dared to hail him lord ,
By poetic license vowels that normally form one syllable
For he bears an ancient wrong about him ,
And the hills where the gods made their home ?
Success is counted sweetest
Land of the breaking dawn ! no more look back
Has come of age to rule in her domain ;
Their baleful zeal had come about ,
But an inner one , giving out rays .
The struggle of the instinct that enjoys
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
" you shall reap the reward of your enterprise ,
Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears .
Should bear thee safe and dry across the sea
With a mouth that laughs and sings ,
To form and fit a soul for heaven .
By fits the sun 's departing beam
The grand tribunal raised ; assign 'd the bounds
When the true lightning of his soul was bared ,
An arch-like , strong foundation , to support
The tones of earthly woe will die away ,
We close our eyes and go to sleep ;
Others stand stupefied between doubt and certainty ,
Blessings and tears of aching thankfulness ,
Youth passes , unredeemed they lie ;
Fled gladly from fierce pain and pleasures dim ,
Of thy father , and give heed !
Give to the pleading hearts comfort and rest ,
Would not the lucre clog my brain ,
For thy lost bliss sing but one parting wail ,
The little creek goes winding
Ca n't see the good which sparrows do .
And all of her beauty shone brightest ,
That marks the steps of time ,
I heard men saying , leave hope and praying ,
The pangs of death distort !
How can a woman 's heart be made of stone
Of night or loneliness it recks me not ;
The morning comes before the sun .
Magdalen 's tall tower tipped with tremulous gold
But the sun , hit blazed away ,
For grief comes never to the strong --
Where so nice a life i led ,
And gather love ere loveliness wear pall ,
And knew hate coiled toward me yet stood stark --
How both had raised the standard of castile ,
The future may ignore or may reveal ;
' what is thy body but a swallowing grave ,
Remote their forces lay , nor knew so far
And here we feel that we are not alone ,
And the sacred incense rose .
Did she take joan 's spirit for her guide ?
And leave their own souls in eclipse , --
He holds on his sovereign sway ;
With face upturned to take the sun like wine .
The heavenly axis . also call 'd to mind
And his feet passed over the sunset land
From sin be daily freed .
" ten thousand years have come and gone ,
Was beauty seen or music heard .
Uncertain music in the shadows played ;
The secrets of the wind it sings ;
Send turk and pope defiance ,
Prayer falls in rain to make broad rivers run
I make this song to lighten their slow time ,
Its eyes flashed vividly , it grimly smiled
But sorrow comes to the old friar ,
And for an instant i was urged to plight
With stealing shadows blurred the dusty day .
Where laughter rose-lip 'd hebe leads :
And gossip ripples whispered at the door .
Which knows thy secret seeks the furthest world .
And through three doors mysterious daylight came .
By love for thee his will was moved .
Last night i drew up mine account ,
The prayer oft mixed with tears before ,
And there lay them safe and sound ;
But left him breathing still .
Sweet hue of eastern sapphire , that was spread
Now the world awakes anew ,
They leave not thee the less unjust .
The stars across the garden throw .
The venus draws her darling -- whom the heaven
No , sparkling still , and redly flashing ,
For certain virtues have dropped to zero ,
That sprang from me , his empire shall extend
To raise in offerings to almighty jove ,
Nor words find utterance ; so with fruitless pain
It swept and pulsed along .
Flushing every face they met with
And gave to english statesmen rest and gout ;
When black thoughts lead astray ;
The earth watches over the lifeless clay
But soon his grave eyes rested on her face ,
He felt that wrong with wrong partakes ,
And bloody hand that beckons on to fate : -
I stand myself . refer this to the gods
Took their impatience somewhat patiently ,
Which vapoury mist and flitting smoke exhales ,
That only serves to make us grieve
And slaughter , turnus swells the wild uproar .
The wood-tick has kept the minutes well ;
Gaze on unnumbered swords that flashed in air
The hermit heard the prayer he made :
To hide the fraud . at interview both stood
And sorrow 's piercing dart .
His shoulders backward , strove to press him down ;
By the soft breezes driven ,
This is the song that made
Widens out her corporation ,
Lose the dreams that haunt the night ?
A growing interest now in church affairs
Is lone and chill ; there dimly shines the light
Where dark ' ning shadows fall .
Which , when to patience grown ,
With banners o’er her roofs that play ,
Thither brought by nine enchanters .
Hence every thought , but that which shows fair youth
With infant terrors , glared as from a trance ,
Saying , " god hath broken the evil spear
Where dusty roads go up and down ,
And the chiefs made answer , saying :
Your clouds , which clad in mourning , glide ,
Hid and revealed by its own proper smile :
While twilight fell , and sacred night came on .
The candlelight sweeps softly through the room ,
And we give our prayers to thee . "
Blue and crimson and white it shines
Strephon caught thy ravish 'd eye ;
Shapes from the past may rove .
And all round that the steep cliffs rose away ,
To gama swift the lordly regent sprung ;
Where they stand thirty and three . '
A solemn council forthwith to be held
Soft through my fingers ran ;
Her sacrifice is found without an heart .
Take the advice ; probatum est .
In playhouse . ere the hero flits --
Whose lips yet lingers reverence on a sigh .
A thousand busy tongues the goddess bears ,
Were i a king , i might command content ;
The crickets , sliding through the grass ,
As her pale placid martyr sinks to sleep ,
Let the little feet go faster ;
Deep silence reigned , save when a gust
Whose winds the gray norns keep , --
Close to her white flesh housed an hour ,
The pain that some strange sweetness now had won ,
Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves
To whom the world ran ocean for her kiss ;
Man 's fitful uproar mingling with his toil ,
And sings thy freedom ; for thy sorrow fills
We , armed with powers of penance , might
Even from the rising splendour of the morn
There runs the fairy king ,
A military vest of purple flowed ,
And patiently wait till your own change shall come .
Ran where the angel showed the way .
The humid wall with paltry pictures spread ;
Of innocence , and with thee bring
The ashes drew together , and of themselves
That lay in the house that jack built .
And makes it silver pure , and gold divine .
And the sunshine follows the rain ;
There rank death clutches at the flowers
That which is needed , in obedience meet ,
May feel it too ; affectionate in look
The circling seas , alone absorbing all ,
They set a marble image by his side ,
Also now must fall a victim ,
Might well have rendered vain their faithful care
Your merry heart goes all the day ,
Your powers the charge can meet :
Little dreams come drifting down
To these fortune-waves that madly swell ,
Will surely pierce a ghostly way ,
And lighted the gloom
Who forms an instrument , ordains from whence
That made the lesson known :
Be mine the fault as mine the hope denied ,
A heart unsullied bring .
And give you immortality enough .
And purpler stains show where the blossoms crowd ,
The twilight hangs half starless ; half the sea
Is sowing the cloud to reap the rain ;
That still upon the griffin steadfast stayed .
Till the anchor rumbled down on stranger shores .
My breath comes keener than the frore
And , lo , the murmurs fell
All eyes were turned on high !
By taking at the sweep the northern arm ,
She said -- then let her eyelids fall ,
And his great love , so freely given ,
And by the breath of mercy made to roll
And earth with all her life sustains ;
I took my power in my hand .
Take all the law will spare ! "
To the light bolero 's measures move ?
Than the hour brings jessie here ;
To simple shepherds , keeping watch by night ;
And freedom find no champion and no child
Long centuries his branches waved
Thou art not fit to hear thyself convinced .
The day must come when this our sacred troy ,
It comes to pass that what was body 's shadow
As a great storm would round you wind .
And watched the white clouds crisply curled
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell .
And he leaned awhile on his bag of gold .
The sad winds swept with low refrain
They shall come with brows that are touched with fire
Leading to endless quarrelling .
The nation yields no more ,
The dusk climbs , but the most illustrious chase
Of hope to rise , or fear to fall ;
The cry she gave of bitter woe !
I can not fathom what fate has wrought .
We take our leaves now of the loom
And through his navel drove the pointed death :
The rival candidates growled and came to blows .
Strange portraits regard him with looks of surprise ,
Shall save thee from the anguish of thy dread .
Put in music we know how fashions end ! "
They to their moment of drawn breath ,
What was it that came out of the night ?
From the slumber in which it lay .
The rosy dimples left her cheek .
The confines met of empyrean heaven ,
With what the future holds for you ;
By good and evil angels fed , sustained
And glittering towers that kissed the skies ,
You fit the taste for paradise ,
Breaking clouds chasing through , --
Endless , and no solution will be found :
Fair as a garden , spreads the smiling plain :
Our feet would fare did each but care
Then the final blow was given ,
What shining life-tides flowed
In long denial and kind silence shown ?
Vines that wandered ,
Drawing the cords that can draw the people ,
My sad heart leaves you to your rest ;
Rivulets that shine and sing ,
Unchecked may mount thy intellectual part
With manly courage fortified .
Marched handcuffed down that sworded street ,
Who , tempting , leads to inebriety !
Here their speech comes tripping after :
Had any mortal voice the injunction laid ,
The western tide crept up along the sand ,
Surpassing , who themselves did make the crown ,
Will soon unlearn the lore it knew ;
Like a great army swell her walls ;
But tell their dreams , and fall asleep again .
I darken to the image . beauty -- love !
No further stirs the sullen soldiery ,
Through me you pass into eternal pain :
And faith confirm his strongest faith in love . g.
What never hits makes thee afraid ,
And above his ears he drew it ,
They sing a service which they feel :
A shout of gladness broke .
Mother , my heart runs over ; but the time
But whence were those that drove the sail
And now and then a sigh he stole ,
There rises up a fearful cry
And feel one 's happy self supremely blest ,
But laws are made for such as you .
They make mankind the mourner ; carry sighs
And one the cause of royal charles maintained :
My breath came gaspingly and thick ,
Which three hours longer can not bear their fury ,
Wells up for those who hold the guiding reins .
Nor share the anguish which he bears for thee ?
To bring me scent of the violet ,
When russia has grown rich and mighty ,
To nobler aims their footsteps guiding on .
Call upon a higher power ,
Flash into fiery life from nothing , follow
Forward they come , with flaunting colors spread ,
But swarms of spectres rose from deepest hell ,
In rayless majesty , now stretches forth
But breathe revenge , and for the combat burn .
The foamy billows rose and sank ,
We seek a gate that leads to life immortal ,
The fountain sang alone ;
Which a beggar scarce would stand in .
Then , as mine eyes escaped his ardent glance ,
Where nevermore the shadows rise or flee ,
Would be saved from all suspicion of treachery ,
Slowly across the chequer 'd shadows pass .
The friend of both to pity was stirred ,
And they poured their havoc down
Who led her youth with flocks upon the plain .
In haste to press to the battle on ,
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill ;
Swift follow hound , and horse , and man ,
To pay a visit to your busy port ,
From thy bright eyes he took his fires ,
Where danger most threatened his banner was borne ,
It struck the signs of the zodiac ,
Such cheer i gather from thy smiling , sweet !
He dragged his weary frame some paces more ,
Demanded love , and the wild hunger tore ;
So , when this state of things i found ,
His faith shall not fail us
Oh , what if a sound should be made !
Now winter night shall see
On chalic 'd flowers that lies ;
For oft i have watched it draw to land ,
He gave a splendid banquet served on plate ,
Chill penury repressed their noble rage ,
Toward the central flood we quickly forge ;
Comes this memory of delight ,
Before her shrine , to whom all things belong ,
Which can await warm youth in its wild race .
But my memory of you escaped them .
Whose courage lies in winking at their foes ,
And palm-wreaths of victory bring .
" the best tree , if ye take intent ,
The throbbing chord of passion that god meant
In the pure dew , under the breaking grey ,
John took his leave at our king ,
The manner of my falling into sleep .
Specimens multiplied . each little group found something new .
A cloud of grief , and stillness deep prevailed .
Whose faces zion ward are set ,
“ jason , remaining life to thee shall owe ;
And yielded to soft slumber all her frame .
Answered in the words which follow :
Is thy life exposed to danger ?
And the smoke rose thickly upward ,
Her faith in dawn was lost .
On the drifting hills of morn shone bright
For woes they wholly feel ?
" i have not broken faith or vow , "
And all the speed her aged limbs can bear .
For the fortune that came at length ;
Look at the price they give .
Thoughts that not burn , but shine ,
Thou pretty bird , how do i see
For it always ran riot -
With all a hero 's honors round his name ;
Her red lips muttered secret words
And that thought made me mad and hot .
The thought with grief my bosom fills ;
Responsive sang : but when the sun had set ,
And all the fine gems they would hold .
But harriet would not take advice ,
And her callers came to dread it ,
Seasons may roll ,
He took one look and then he cried ,
" these follow me , " the season says :
That rises from thy singing 's deep ,
Hath flattering words to move her
So pass her days in labour sped with peace .
And the rich conflict that energy meets !
This in orlando moved great grief , and he
And made my journey to the great spirit
Can it be death ? and do they only stand
Winter will pass with its snows ;
It made my cold , hard bosom sore .
Sages and fools go on
The father 's prayer arose .
And a tear stood in his e ’ e.
The rains roll off its crest like spray ,
Fronting the dawn he moved ; a leopard skin
Thou trumpet set for shakespeare 's lips to blow !
Were sprinkled ; yet no violence could move
And hours of heartless glare have overrun .
Spirit , substantial form , with matter join 'd
And bumper , " long may the church endure ,
Lay the great leader low .
Some sudden ruin will plunge upon thy head ,
In balancing the profit and the loss ,
The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore !
Flushed with delight , as kisses burn ,
And she rocked the fire to brightness ,
Nor are his blessings to his banks confined ,
And making knowledge paramount to wealth .
The mourning voices trail
Yet think not death will serve thy stead ;
As the van goes by with the prison wretch ,
The only throb she gives ,
A greater victory give .
Terror , who shakes the bravest warrior 's soul ;
They flash upon me like long strips of sand
" my hour is not yet come . "
To the stretched silence of the blinded gulfs .
One deed wrought out in holiness and love
She sees herself a queen of song once more ;
How would i follow on thy viewless course ,
The loser bears the burden of defeat ;
All noble fashions to make people glad
But always one unchanging distance kept ,
Can never return , it has fleeted away .
As those fresh chaplets wove in dawn and dew
Be thine a voice to smite the lie ,
Since honor 'd rose its blooming ides
Fair towns which grain and treasure held ,
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn 'd .
Hence among these i go with downcast front . "
Is it fright you have taken ?
How dar ' st thou move the populace against
" and follows with his soul my brother true ,
The viols played and the dancers whirled .
To guard the city from surprise
Is consumed by secret sorrow .
Sad was the scene of slaughter shown
Bowing to god , yet bending to no creed ,
Three pines strained darkly , runners in a race
It seems to come to mooring on the main
As mothers blend with their caress
Have stored their wealth of shower and sunshine there ;
Thus in the earth to so idly lie ,
When light the listless wind the forest stirred .
His heart 's pure planet shining yet
Crown 'd with eternal fame , they sit sublime ,
And smashed , to cleanse the world of guilt .
May serve a crumpled hour to smooth ,
And made your heart begin to beat .
The kiss that happier children claim ,
Each changing season intimately saith ,
The gusty blossom , that tosses and swings ,
On my soul comes the joy of the beam ,
Take that as solace of thy flight .
But the long veranda dripping with dew ,
The peaceful seas two lovely sisters bore .
His glory hides . the victory won ,
And providence have wrought thus quaintly . here
The songs that other people sang . she took
And christian denmark still thinks on
And the sunlight danced on the wave .
That filled the soul with ecstasy of infinite delight ;
The life-fount whence his hand did gather
The soul , to find
And to place the wreath of fame
Which but to love , pursue and pray for well
Love that only lives to grace ye ,
So by god 's cheap economy made rich
My hasty words , would all be put aside ,
And image tumbled on a rose-swept bay ,
As the piping orpheus drew
Her riches round them spread ,
The glowing autumn passed , and then
Earth , cleft asunder , groaned in pain ,
And flo 's catching up in the straight .
The rights of men demand thy care :
Toward jagged heights black oaths float ,
A king might wish to hold in fee .
Reviving dreams that long have lain asleep !
The clan went on with the pipes before
For man 's illusion given ;
And the fair life which in the distance lies
And as dire ruin follows , and from high ,
As its the glory gathered by his sword .
A desert road which no sands have swept ,
Only give them fire to light them .
His unresisting hands made haste to bind ;
And ilus gained that moment of delay .
' mong the green trees was it whispered ,
For all the sins that cling to thee
And the charm of the carol rapt me ,
And rumors that he 's dead hath driven me
Where plenty of good cheer i see ,
Why break the seals of mute despair unbidden ,
We take the future , you the past ,
The cruel courtezan by whom was made ,
When , like the stars , the singing angels shot
That still the best and dearest gift remains .
The flower that once has blown for ever dies .
To groves where stiliness sat supreme ,
So he took his wings , and fled ;
My waste has fed full many a store ,
Drink made it doubtful if he lied ,
Among them rose ormusses ' valiant knight ,
Here orpheus sings ; trees moving to the sound
Worth being rich to hold in fee .
My hopes , my toil , are cast away ,
The hand of blessing hath , trembling , laid
The god they came to worship lay .
In sorrow 's waste will meet you ;
Feeling the pangs he gave , for of himself
Through what dark forest came her feet ?
As dreams of faded happiness , and life
" the prize that greece shall seize again !
Low voluptuous music winding trembled ,
Sweet peace sits crowned with smiles ,
The which my drama cares not to rehearse ,
Draw forth the cheerful day from night :
And it fills all my heart with rejoicing
Within his breast there beat a spotless heart ;
To the heaven he keeps for all tired souls ,
And made its colours , like the serpents skin
Then the news came ! i shed many tears
The curtain rose before a castle grand ,
A sweat-like death all over him came ;
Their sufferings have collected in their souls .
All silent comes the balmy gale ;
Which orpheus for eurydice did make ,
“ a cureless wound her silent breast contains ;
To bring the summons of warm day 's approach ,
Indignant the embassy went away ,
She shines on thieves on the garden wall ,
That passage down must go provided well .
" open thy bosom to the truth that comes .
A solitary tepee lifts its solitary crest ,
A sorrow that i can not tell .
As each sweet feature made it stay --
Where drifted blossoms freak the grass ;
Authoritative of that elder , sprang
Quick he takes his balm of healing ,
Which can deliver me from every grief . "
My heart sprang in beneath that fringed vail ,
It put him to such pain ;
She in my mask a hidden sense would read :
The death of all , and all together lost .
The bells toiled slowly , sadly ,
My comfort stood : and the bright sun was now
Will put choice honey for a favoured youth :
His spirit in them taught :
“ will raise thy wonder at the monstrous crime ,
Love is passing ! love is passing !
Knowing my life laid waste by my own hand ,
Outward , upon her right did reach
Meantime all forward drew : me terror seiz 'd
Which tells him thou art all his own ?
Melting snows , and gliding shades .
Was a smile that went up sideways
By reason of the wrappage following it ;
Of things that creep encumbered with huge burdens
Its meed of praise may justly claim :
A river that had spent itself in some chasm ,
She spreads her sunny robes of morning light .
So that he went sore wounded from the field :
Still his bold arms determined to employ ,
Such art they trust may yet revivify .
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
Veiled her own fears to banish his : --
It will make no melody at my will ,
Dropping his scythe , poor morley took his way ,
Under their clear and glossy skin made blush
And irritation moves the nerves of sight .
Sounds that gentle thoughts inspire :
The tears that spring of rapture flowed .
From this incident i wrote the verses that follow :
The trade in human flesh is driven ,
The dead shall go in white .
So may a sailor give the winds control
But lips where smiles went out and in ;
No southern breezes come to bless ,
And from his holy lips these accents broke :
Of time go by ; meantime the key ,
While fancy lifts the veil between :
These to their sad catastrophe betrayed ! '
To the banquet held at pohja ,
When the tapers now burn blue ,
To suffer punishment as law finds due ;
Blind prisoners from the hour that gave them birth .
For war to enter through .
In their due season . sorrow can not keep
Shall dogs and carrion vultures make their feast . "
The orchard tree has grown one copse
Whose hand so gently melts the ladies hand ,
These led to talks and dreams : how oft
As might turn virtue pale ! when sunday came ,
Bot be wel war , er that ye take ;
And not for long death takes his toll .
And out of sight to highest heaven mounted ,
Nor to yield to grievous sorrow ;
And o'er fernando 's weakness drop the tear .
The lot it fell on henry martyn ,
For the deceitful counsel which he gave .
Now god shall show the right . "
The dying sun prepares his golden grave .
And wealth about thy life shall fold ,
Comfort , to stay the secret soul with sleep .
Her thoughts were by naught on earth now bound .
And the mercury mounts to one hundred and one ;
In the yellowing leaves o ' the orchards hung ;
I seemed to stand and listen , while each word
The nudity of flesh will blush though tameless
Unhappy ! nought but fleeting air he held .
It covers , but not hides , the sky .
The scribe no question makes of verse or prose ,
Unfriendly fate i see .
But now in the dusk the tide is turning ,
Of dragging down his enemy made them move .
This trouble gone , this sorrow ended ,
Follow thy perfumes by the smell ;
Shrill came the night-wind ,
Shall make thee shudder , wheresoever heard .
For truth appeared in view ;
To the solemn abyss leads the terrible path ,
In this wise , to his melody returning ,
That issued from its brink . on earth no wave
From the misty realm , that belongs
" could aught of song declare my pains "
Take care , one scarce can see --
The green leaf nor stays nor goes ,
Shall warble forth a joyous strain ;
Now the great winds shoreward blow ;
“ a purple tinge his feathers take , the hue
That i with beauty still may keep my tryst .
Her memory the king with honour kept .
Facing whatever may come as an end to the story
What are the joys that my heart discloses ?
I think the honey guarded with a sting ;
That all the murky ether seems to turn
He must pay ; that makes him pout
And thus my prudent counsel speak .
And spectral shadows flitted by .
Thus cares on cares his painful days consume ,
Comes greater light , succeeded by the less .
And every zephyr brings a sigh .
She felt that all complaint was vain ,
Soft lamps , that hung like burning flowers ,
That fills my soul with joy .
And down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears .
And let the chords of life be riven
The only plan allowed by law
Till sun and thaw shall melt its crown ,
Which joins two souls , remember this :
To bring dishonour to sir stodge .
Yet not of the favour sought .
In chrysoprase apartments hung ,
So softly time trod with me , that i lost
The ploughman from the sun his season takes ,
The years shall come and pass , but we
And pass his days in peace among his own .
A generous tear will caledonia shed ?
When tears are spent , and then art left alone
And join with thee calm peace , and quiet ,
No strife within , can reach .
Some trepidation stood in ,
Bide thy time and thou shalt see . "
Turning still to the vanished years ,
Leave thy day-dreams to thy sister ,
In answer set ? what agency doth this ? "
The waters rush 'd , the waters rose ,
To the galloping aids , carrying orders ,
Yet evil whence ? in thee can harbour none ,
To send the rolling year :
And set in gold like that which shines
A fissure dripping tears ; these , gathering all
Her foemen ever upon earth had laid :
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change ,
She cast dread looks about the place ,
Eternal love to fill it , and no more
Borne by thee while the glad world thee contained ,
That bounds the lower ether : there shall dwell ,
Heaven 's golden treasures tumbling pour ....
For life itself , though spent with him ,
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high .
And found in silent slumber late relief .
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see ?
Light that within them is , shall sharpen thine
The deep grass moved and whispered
Her proud content she bears as a flag is borne
Such fulness of delight the list ' ner feels .
That backs the landscape fresh and still .
It had that moment left the grave .
The hypocrite holds the state . "
All that it saw when alone with its laughter ,
And in it contentment and happiness find ;
That , crying , met an answering cry
To heal and raise from death my heart .
So flashed and fell the brand excalibur :
My senses want their outward motion
Answered in the words which follow :
And sweetly melt into just shade and light
Strange mystery of god which set
And saw the stars shine in the glance
The mighty baptist that way marks the line
Filled the drowsy air with buzzing ,
That all my sense in ravishment was lost .
My friendly pen would show him --
It snared us one more hour of bliss . "
That did my fears betray ;
Though still your savings you might waste ,
To enforce the mandate that a tyrant sent ;
Her thanks at parting doralice bestowed .
My whole heart rises up to bless
The tale of ancient italy portray ,
Let me but love my love without disguise ,
Let us pass the night together .
Fast climbed the sun : the flowers were flown ,
And nature gladly gave them place ,
When the christmas-tide drew nigh ,
Which came once a year
When wisdom learns to comprehend !
The last couplet assumed a second form :
An elm was near , to whose embraces led ,
The names of all their moods and figures fit ;
Shone brighter still once called to public view .
Smile and rainbow leave no traces ; --
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
But men -- made to inherit all --
Pondered deeply and reflected
The flashes come and go ;
My infant tears a sort of measure kept ,
The ocean gives in many ways --
That gathers there from land and sea ,
For the deceitful counsel which he gave .
" to the northward stretched the desert ,
Or time was calcined by electrical fire ;
And might have led to constant family strife ,
Were worse to thee than feeling none ,
And ocean knew no limit but the sky .
Nature , that never made so fair a face ,
The virtue nearest to our vice allied ;
While yet the battle raged only without
Then sorrow , touched by thee , grows bright
And nothing with him stayed .
And hasty axes shape the homes forlorn .
Backward i turned me from those weary souls .
" the greatest joy that can come to man
The fear alone had served my turn indeed ,
Doth gnaw away thy health and leave thee sick ,
He poured forth a roguish tune yet ,
He who when duty calls him spares
Or gave my heart a song .
And put all foes to flight .
To wrap me in its garments fold .
A massy tripod for the victor lies ,
He marked not marmion 's colour change ,
And all thy heart lies open unto me .
The pathos of his music stirred .
But if that flower with base infection meet ,
As when a field of corn revives again
Nor makes him pay his wisdom for his joys ;
Quae genus took it snug and close :
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
And mused me on the wretched ones that pass
It played along the bright ebony ,
Their april song thrilled tonbridge air ;
And gentle converse that lifts me up to be ,
And naked they conveyed
Love 's bright flame is burning still !
That floats along the twilight sea .
Thus , thus we live , and spend the hours
But full rewards the victor 's toils attend .
Thine image in his heart he keeps ,
While the far mountains tower to meet the glow ,
Dimness conceals the hunger in our faces ,
And give directions , but with shield and sword
Or penn upon the delaware , to lead
With joy that pair bore battleward their lord ,
But they drew no music from it ,
As up his force the tempest brings ,
Now reached he forth in folds and forward pressed ,
He , following up the thrust with taunting cries ,
That 's free to give , or to recall .
The clouds that on his western throne attend .
Till the soul turns back to april
They will surely come to grief .
Unconscious as it goes .
A petal falls from the dreamland rose .
Would lead her home ' mid wealth of plundered may
But souls who have sought to eliminate self .
" what advice should now be followed ,
And made resolve to speed his wooing on
The pity of snow that hides all scars ;
The darkness left her ; by a well
To quench the fire of anguish in some eye
And tender blade , that feared the chilling blast ,
And that 's how all the stars are made .
In every heart the future shall give rages
For ruined ships remembered where they lie .
To fasten in the hook of matrimony ,
No answer came from hill or fell ,
And sorrow banished from thy breast ,
" in every soul the secret thought i read ,
They went by chance , amidst their talk ,
A red-blue column of fire shot out ,
This said , he sat ; and expectation held
And jealousy breed bitterness that rolls
Since satan fell , whom follie overthrew ,
An ' hours fly ower them sweetly
Far promise of the spring already northward turned .
Now other imaged meanings pass ;
Take either one of them unaware .
As the silent years depart ,
That spoke the man of taste and of politeness .
This bleak despair that drives me to the pit :
Who gave thee power upon the soul of man
Upward th ' eternal lamp sends forth a glimmer ,
It was jest a cold she 'd caught ,
The soul now climbs it just to perish there !
Heal all the wounds that war has made .
Yet not wrapped about with awful mystery ,
Of tumbling waters rose , and all around
But satan still goes up and down the earth ;
The faith they owe ; when earnestly they seek
Ere the sun has reached its setting . "
The years shall come and pass , but we
As fits the merry christmas time . *
Of one about to reach her journey 's end .
That something like a mood has gathered there ,
To give repentance to her lover
Pressed hard by thronging foes ,
Such wondrous power god to his saint will lend ,
Holds his breath and grovels latent ,
When first they feel , with secret pain ,
Like talons darting up to clutch the sky .
By years of solitude , -- that holds apart
The gentle fair may move ,
To bear false witness in a case ?
Shall warning signal come ,
With its death , disguised as life ,
The vast and helpless city while it sleeps .
And if fortune go cross to my plan ,
How yet the regal aspect he retains !
Let love but in this bower be lighted ,
God , gave him grace that he got revenge
What though no tidings came to brighten time ,
To take once more the british side ;
This rávaṇ ’s dread commands impel
He had come back to make the vision true .
He read each wound , each weakness clear ;
Light and wild shadows as it ranged its hook .
Then up she took her little crook ,
Bury us two together , " came her words .
For i had found day after day too sore ,
Fierce the battle that will follow .
Thy colours bear as banneret ;
He gave his soul to god ,
Old time will make thee colder ,
Quench 'd the flame , quench 'd the flame ;
And gave himself the answer . it was this :
Erect , and balances his bloated shape ;
Full tones should catch as aforetime ;
Soothe the pangs of heartstrings broken ,
His army next brought from zumara land .
And the wintry world lies waiting
The child 's voice trembled , his lips shook
The stoic courage had the wound conceal 'd ;
“ with horror struck , the ancient dame holds forth
It is not quenched the torch of poesy ,
The wearied man whose course was run ,
Now use your strength and nimble hands ; ye need
Your laugh shall fill the world with flame ,
And heaven forgives me , whom it loves ,
And his wishes served to guide him ;
Along her slender masts , the sails took flight ,
And made it seem a heavenly child .
The tall pines bowing where they stand ,
But asks eternity .
And not a hand to stir their crimson pall .
What course could prudence sanction love to take ?
Hast thou , in seeking wealth or fame ,
Blinds its eyes and breaks its fingers ;
But turn me to the valiant paladine ,
" ' taste the food that stands before you ;
This was the prison which his soul looked through ,
Are the dim parents of a guilt not dim ;
The lovely music died -- the bright throngs fled --
Wherein he seemed to read the truth that lay
That speeds the moral prospect to deform !
With arms reversed , and mourning for the slain .
The sabbath comes : the work-days six
Then my dream did waver and break and lift --
The little cottage stood alone , the pride
And eastward glides by buried halls along ,
And in her face sees traces of a laugh .
Death only with the lowest dust lays even .
The whole world lies in drop of dew ;
His thunder on thy head , devouring fire .
All longing the time when howling blasts go ,
Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim
And his red fell clean for being married .
If thou for churlishness our justice take .
To make this grove thy dwelling-place ?
It seem 'd that it cried to cheer me ,
O mountain whereon gods made chase of kings ,
Making the star seem silver streak 'd with gold .
In thy divine emotions spoke ;
Horizons that change -- they pass and glide ,
Setting a watch upon my unwise heart ,
Shot down his spark of kindling love ;
The people looked for leadership and law .
And through the world their way must make . "
That rules our spirits with commands and threats :
Shall drop sweet influence through her drowsing lid ;
Wisely said , the lord made answer ,
For his shall give atonement ; and to hurl
Nor mercy be to any one extended .
Alone gives aid to city charged with sin .
Bow down our towering thoughts to thee ,
Better to make one soul rejoice with glee ,
The animus with which their comments fell ,
And nothing with him stayed .
Shall mark my day , or measure my night .
And find new thoroughfares for its return ,
The guiding rein and symbol of command .
As the rapturous notes rose loud and gay ;
Ye have gone nigh to fill my heart ;
When anger hurried on the heels of fear ,
The shining drops of dew the elves bring each day
Thrilling with pity , olive hid her eyes .
The waters babble as they run --
Let tyrants govern with an iron rod ,
Of every fiction in narration grows ;
Broke up , shall heave the ocean to usurp
To sorrow come ,
The public victim , to redeem the state .
His life in nature 's affluence spent ;
Thus while he dealt it round , the pious chief
Has fallen as of spring ; the tender sky
The going forth of god upon these waters .
Evil can but serve the right ,
His modest eyes he fix ’d upon the ground ;
Need a hero filled with valor ,
And shall not heaven for this its terrors show ,
Who wove coarse webs to snare her purity ,
His orphans raise their feeble wail :
A dream that would have mocked all other bliss .
That lit the velvet blossoms which we trod ,
There moves what seems a fiery spark , --
To solemn thoughts that soar to heaven
The moment grim death planted darts in his breast .
The sun through the fissures slants ,
Or make him ask more knowledge of his bliss .
The very stanes that adam bore ,
When predrag could spring upon his courser ,
Full in her face was shining the king .
And bliss , the word was born .
From their brows love burning shone --
Like liquid pearls fresh showered from heaven ,
Lest anger in his breast should rise ;
To crush the pillars which the pile sustain .
Never was blast from vapour charged with cold ,
The hands of holy promise , finds a throng
And a forest round it rolls .
And set the crown of silence on your art ,
Still calling on his lost patroclus ' shade .
Not the baby-looks that go
Our hearts made new ,
The backward toilet goes ; and swift
And faint hearts bound , and sad eyes smile ,
The briarrose shakes its sweet perfumes ,
How soon my lucy 's race was run !
A kindly grace may touch the hardest heart .
Fidelity and innocence are found
Which in the final judgment thou shalt see . "
The victory giveth ;
Such chill embraces as the snow-covered heights
And gathering tears , and tremblings of distress ,
Spoke the very words which follow :
And the light went out of the sun :
A thousand evil thoughts , resolved on one .
That the wind came out of the cloud , chilling
Of mirth is turned to sadness .
Come follow , heart upon your sleeve ,
And found such modest graces in his virgin bride ,
And the music of glasses that merrily ring ,
All that these lovers ever felt of love ,
Laughter of thee would rock its festal height .
From loving eyes destruction brings .
And owned a brighter heaven was opened here .
And drown my woes in wine !
That only brief contingencies it makes ;
I will look up to god and trust .
To make our taxes and our slavery last ,
As winds blow over the sea
With hero hearts that beat ,
Now , like that struggling beam , receding fast ,
Houses and church-spires stretch away ;
And every flower was bathed in light ,
And as a friend now hold discourse with me ;
But when the emperor had made complete
But time which none can bind ,
Upon the frosty air came ringing .
But the hour shall come after his youth ,
A radiant head leans on my heart ,
Still he feels thy spell of glamour ;
( where should i follow ? )
To work your soul 's redemption , -- glorious noons
Her outline on the mountain he can trace ,
When the impregnate air retains the thread ,
With drops of anguish falling fast and red
A hundred brooks , and still they run
And priests like him who newport 's market trod ,
While softest music , as if borne on wings ,
Or echo of the mother loss has stirred ,
With arcita , in stories as men find ,
The day arrived when daycourt and his bride
Bring success from former failures ;
To hold the added sweetness of a song .
Wisdom for all ; and when it seeks relief ,
And all the birds make songs for her .
And long and fierce the battle raged .
His name and towers for centuries still shall stand .
The which , in disentangling for their fire ,
To the great dame whence incarnation flows .
Shores disappear 'd , and every hill withdrew ,
Filled with the glorious sound from wall to wall ,
I gave the letter to be sent with dawn ;
The aged nestor to his seat withdrew .
" so they both went slowly down ,
He clasped her close as death can hold ,
When her marphisa to his care conveyed .
Temptation , rooted to his master 's side ;
The golden flood came out ,
The same low sky would weave its fading blue ,
The fainting stripling sank before the stroke :
From her paramour 's breast it fell . "
Came the spring with all its splendor ,
Hand she laid on all gold that was there ,
Dancing with life , then the silence
And that smile the song rewarded --
She keeps my rising family
O'er the holy vessels spread .
And his bridle rein he drew .
From wells of salvation pure water he draws .
Men are to filial freedom brought .
To genius shall it first be given ,
You may forget the warmth he gave ,
This foot hath got a mouth and lips
And many a lonely hour we 've spent ,
" see that the messenger takes some refreshment .
And the captain boldly goes
( so is he prompted by his daring sprite )
We struck at slavery ; to the verge
With midnight silence blend .
And she found herself leading the lancers
And we gather the gains he hath won ,
To calm the god that holds the watery reign ;
These hirelings they 'll never stand ,
Nor had i nursed in woe and pain
To feel the passion of eternity ?
And cooling airs sprang up to blow
When near us the solace lies ?
In flattery completely doused ,
And ev'ry hour felt more inclin 'd
Saturn bends his brows of gloom ,
From october 's tossed and trodden gold
And burned his soul with righteous ire ;
So much in precious time forever lost .
And thus with prudent words addressed :
And like a lightning flash leaped forth her knife :
Let earth its chill colours regain ,
Of self-denial , drove him harshly forth
A spark to burn for life was flown .
And touch the lute , and range the dance :
Let it wipe another 's tears ;
While the sunrise touched the tree-tops ;
That in the heaven appears was there diffused .
On one side , creeds that dare to teach
Against thee now , thy shores invade .
Their hearts are swayed unto pinabel .
Ere yet was lost the art divine ;
An ' comes the sweet twilight gloom ,
One mute look of suffering moved me
Her that gave thee life and beauty ,
In those bleak chambers made such din as stopped
And thus made answer to their lord :
( there they alike in trembling hope repose , )
The france here laid in her bloody ditch ,
Joy still must sorrow , sorrow joy attend .
God hid the secret of our land ,
Which forms a pedigree from miss to miss ,
Honeyed hands are beating honey-measures .
That gives a palm to all ?
Your wonderful words , that all mean verily
The mingling notes came softened from below .
Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief .
The five hopeless years of his sorrow were cast
To bar the ways for mutual succor made !
So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith :
Lest a bloody fight should follow .
For there did pelias hold a sacrifice
Sublime to raise the spirit drooping ,
When the sick man seeks the air ,
And thick clouds of smoke rose upward ;
In alien lands the tidings bring ;
May better read the darkened soul ,
For i am filled with perfect joy from it .
For nigh two decades spring had breathed ;
A gleam of horror on his senses broke ;
This made the landlord only scoff .
Earth left its ghost as on the funeral shore .
And take and give the joy that hari grants ,
The rainbow comes across the hill ,
The tranquil scene lies further still from youth :
Where the summers go ; --
For our hearts shall not give way .
Of grace restored ; while the great orb of day
My harp , alas ! is drenched in tears ,
Be what thou prayest to be made ;
Contemplate here the wonder i unfold .
Who followed his sovereign over the belt ,
To gain one glimpse of you ever anon !
When roll the skies as a parchment slight .
Their beauty might declare :
Her answer heard , and thus with gracious smile :
That held a subtler spirit than our wine ,
Before that levy broke in panic dread :
Sweet memories that long will last ;
Where could i gather fancies now ?
As one star with another star is placed .
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
That he now may plow the ocean ,
The trembling aspen , the noble pine ,
Spake at last the words that follow :
Through which the charge was made ; --
Souls go with bodies , bound together ,
Then come misfortune , i bid thee welcome ,
Where the grey elder-thickets hang .
No daylight trembling on the dungeon bar ;
Thither came three sportsmen ,
The comprehensive mandate which they give --
That in this quiet forest lies .
He ceased ; nor made the pensive queen reply ,
And at this first rite the fates stood by ,
It pass , and intercept our better fates :
To catch the sacred raining of star-light :
Kind nature ! thou hast taken to thyself ;
And my heaven i found in your face .
Here , lately shut , that workbox lay ,
He wove a song that can not die .
When i first felt her lips that sucked my breasts
The victor could not from his insults keep ,
Can i take part in such distress ? --
Even from thyself thy loathsome heart to hide ,
As the pleasant june comes on ;
Where he was minded to have made abode ;
A chorus of colors came over the water ;
Sumitrá ’s son his words obeyed ,
And his own burning breath came short and quick ,
Nine long years may he be worn by sickness ,
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid ,
So , if years should come of famine ,
And faint a hidden pain her hot heart stirred ,
His haloes rayed the very gore ,
For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth
The twice-born hence pure lives maintain ,
Rounder and clearer came , and danced along
To give foreknowledge true , and certain doom .
The talk of the rushes has come .
Of wheat and barley wavered in the eye
And he spoke the words which follow :
Now growing with the strengthening daylight strong
Horror of darkness poured ; a sharp pang thrilled
Which from the slain i took ; for distant fight
And track the giant foul with sin .
Love , in you , went passing by ,
For arrogance noted ; to his memory
Ere the dew from the grass has gone ,
Gives this answer to the suitor :
The garden has grown silent -- void of song ,
There lies a strip of barren sand ,
Consigning , laid by the laborious greeks ,
And troubled ocean roared reply .
And yet esteem that cheap which love has bought .
And pale votaries shiver with the cold ,
As ever a flower your winter gardens hold .
Ye may find ye hearts that are british still --
Had yielded like a coward .
Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee ,
And hold communion there with god .
From human arm , that life was kept .
But pass on into life :
" that god can hardly wipe it out ? "
I finde a tale write also ,
For saints to grow in strict conformity
Mourned with his nymphs for ruin fallen on troy ,
A cloud from eastward ran athwart the skies ,
My restless thoughts among them roam . . .
That can meet this blade ancestral . "
Relentless justice bids thee bleed :
And all that the future still hides .
Unblamed abundance crowned the royal board ,
Silence sits often on me as i touch
To halve the round of life with me .
The warrior would have done , had rendered vain .
The winter waned . one eve i went ,
That came to port on the fundy tide
And then the vest of wondrous virtue gave ,
And our lips to show forth thy praise ,
One treads once more the piny paths that lead
But with my numbers mix my sighs :
The brows circled with ivy ,
There was more life than breath can give ,
The strength angelic natures claim ;
How far to make the money go .
For while the tired waves , vainly breaking ,
Thing that had throbbed ere shot black lightning through .
Increase with grief , tears make tears ' way ,
And spent my days to find --
“ what promises , what prayers , what coaxing words
They ring the tune of enderby !
With this true flesh , that follows after him .
If it should come to be
Whose marge the wistful waves lap listlessly --
O’er leagues of land she stretched in pride ,
And catch the manners living as they rise ;
A wave to pant beneath thy power , and share
Your sincere and attached friend ,
What ! shall the poet that which nature gave ,
My soul is of a braver mettle made :
That he whose lot first issued , the assay
Whistles a snatch that seeks his soul unsought ,
A weight -- a load within i bear ;
But faithfulness , tho ' counted less ,
And brighter burned the christmas flame ,
The next long hour slowly strikes at last ,
He brings by falsifying of the coin ,
At last he builded a perfect faith ,
Between his cheek and ear the weapon went ,
And in it mantle the new rising heir :
While rising vapours , and descending shades ,
A beauty to the scenes which round it lie ,
" nothing comes from what is useless ,
The inspiration for this verse comes from o. 33 .
Answered in the words which follow :
To join the heavenly ranks a happy family .
Nor turn to deadly injury .
When we had reached where underneath the height
That once there was one whose veins ran lightning
For still with truth accords his taste refined .
All one day they spent in hunting ,
There through the borders steals the silver lake ,
The herald-men brought tidings then
Stood the township , where my errand lay .
So well did smack the bait ;
The moist to moist retires ; earth gets increase
I will make answer even to the thought ,
From her fond eyes summoned to join the array
That goes pulling the moon
Perhaps find fortune or a woman -- well
Sad days and years upon me rolled ,
And that lame wisdom that has writhen feet ,
For thou art nearer to him , and take heed
A word of sorrow never to be stilled ,
By high education brought pressure to bear .
Each gale comes fraught with sounds of woe ;
Myself alone the dreadful war shall wage ,
Taken and kept entire , more praise has shed
These ashes from the altar take with speed ,
As fate does lead or draw us ; none ,
So i laid it wistfully aside .
Their valour in the fight displayed .
The buds have come to town ;
Fallen is the sun who gave us light ,
Distractions , duties , came too fast for me .
The booty the injuns got .
You get the chills and fever-shakes ,
The good , that gives contentment to this court ,
It swelled with the sharp joy of the air .
And fresh-blown roses washed in dew ,
I had conveyed my wealth along the road .
And fix its hopes on a purer sphere ;
Eyes will brighten and blushes will burn
He saw life face to face ,
Come , see the wavering light expel the gloom
And trace the secret springs of nature 's laws ,
Which gave such a stress to his oval stride
To everie sound that under heaven blew ;
This great mistake corrected ; i have found
Enraptured , plunged her nose .
Answered in the words that follow :
Weeping i said : " the things that present were
Then wait ( for so their formal rites compel )
New counsels tries , and new designs prepares :
Should i her cruelty express ,
The name vandalia from the vandals bore .
And your strong faith the strong world buffeted .
Winter 's inclement cold to bear ,
Is gone -- wherever it goes -- for good ,
Nor ever try to shake a fit
" give the word ! " but no such word
Where deep and low the hamlets lie
And her sad immemorial passion come upon her ;
It was that parliament that took
Or lulling random squabbles when they rise ,
Should fade as swiftly as it came .
But nature says : ' my children most they seem
To save the lord the trouble .
His bursting passion into plaints thus pour 'd :
And the old cow raised a lowing ,
Falters because of the vision it sees ;
His homeless eyes appeared to trace
Here go about for to recite
What dost thou here ? the cause explain :
And clamours of startled calls arise
The old and wonted course is run ,
And the sea trembled with her silver light .
My charlie has gone to the war ,
They both for breath did stand ,
These thoughts revolving : " in the years to come
To fell the timber , and forget the war .
And fortune casts eurylochus to go ;
Without whose aid the world stands still ,
The landscape , all made sharp and clear
Lost and forgotten of winds that have fallen asleep ,
Waiting to take the up-bound train .
Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore ,
And with brave words discuss the things of old .
But when i would have made the blessed sign ,
' night will come on ; when seated snug ,
They are broken loose and making for the woods .
Yet shed what tears sad truelove should .
Your heart had told you so .
But who hath breathed the scent of violets
There went none quyk away .
Forth from his mouth the bright blood sprang ,
Whose road runs far by sands and fruitful space ;
Which time 's slow ripening alone can make ,
That shone from the pure spirit in her face .
Cold has caught the wings of birds ;
As when the french , that dissipated nation ,
On europe thence and where rome was to sway
Two crowned kings , and one that stood alone
Until a month and more had slipped away .
No pomp was there , no glory shone around
And he spoke the words which follow :
For the black cloud had fallen of endless night .
And straight the sun was flecked with bars ,
Who bore the ponderous bible 's storied wisdom ,
But the vows we plighted
Poets and private tutors are exposed ,
April brings the primrose sweet ,
And nature , the old nurse , took
A chosen train of youth around him stand ;
As heaven had spent all perfumes there !
And a boat rose from the furnace ,
Gathering its strength up to pursue the race ;
Is built ; and therefore substance it intends .
But hate could dwell if once they flashed the fire
His visit doubled , double season makes ;
Life , that so faithfully dwelt with us ,
When love , with fiery accents calling , woke
A molten colour , trembling and hot ,
Life brought them first to kisse the light ,
With lighter heart could bound along ,
" we , alas ! have come for vengeance ,
His wit and whiskers came from foreign parts !
Hath brought a new and , quickening smart
How their sweetest smile is kept for him
( the sunlight flickers on the sea ) ,
With the mystery hid in its heart of gold .
And time went by with birds and flowers ,
The wind hath blown a gale all day ;
Silent she went , nursing the grief that kills ,
Which closes over men , however noisy
Or catch the whispers of the waterfall
The purple violet , the pink shall join ,
And made this sedgy solitude .
A night made hoary with the swarm
That she thy career may with roses spread ;
And shaken basis , own 'd the present god :
All vanished hopes , and all most hopeless bliss ,
God that glads the lover 's heart ,
So still it lay that every day
" the spoils unto the conquerors belong .
It wistful , wondering creeps .
And nerves herculean bend her sinewy limbs ;
Infrangible , immortal : there they stay :
All things go duly in their ordered train ,
Accept the flower of love we lay with these
And her soul obtained new strength ,
All forced by some strange necromancy
With sighs accompanied , and her complaint
The tumult silence , and the fight suspend .
Wherein the young world took delight ;
And the widow gives the party .
And bunches of the branches stood ;
Surprising ! infidelity turns out
The close-set ranks swung into place .
Boaster of freedom , found no longer free ,
" yonder the fatal emblem lies !
The sun sank down and the stars shone out
The bullets whistled into space ,
Made promise of the way her sect enjoins .
Break forth as laughter on lips that said
But if tears ever touched , for any grief ,
Already there , with curious eyebrows raised ,
Whose heart is caught with mine ?
The monarch then his solemn silence broke ,
But she can not raise the war-ship ,
Peacefully the monster journeyed
And sunlike pleasures shine at home .
To find if hearts be wild and wise ,
Where are the lips mine lay upon ,
And her roving eyes flew to them
What nerves its hands to strike a deadlier blow
Now must the attack be made where least suspicion makes
He lifts from the ocean his burning eye ,
Could bow the steel of that proud chastity ,
Their mutual joys together share .
Life in the cause of virtue would lay down :
When their presumptuous souls forgat the gods .
But many a night the black flag flew
That found her once in europe their sole shrine
_ each brother gave a solemn croak . _
To the rude shock of war both armies came ;
He makes our dearest earthly comforts flee ,
That goes without the beard .
Which sits as conscious daughter of a queen .
And autumn brought his purple haze ,
Till a city came to naught , --
The world turns softly
A silence falls on speech , and his eyes
Next rattling dice invite th ' attentive ear ,
My sneers upon the weak i shed :
Whereon his grief and pity grow afresh .
Then bring me , showers of roses bring ,
That to my will gave wings ; and i began
Narcissus , with whom she falls in love .
It maks my heart go dancin '
But near of heart they ever kept ,
First to their sires their birth they owe ,
Which runs across some vast distracting orb
To roll with pleasure in a sensual sty .
Will reach up to a most astounding height .
From the south-east came the whirlwind ,
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
Before the dim eyes , a picture comes ,
Dishonour passed ; the dalliance ,
Demands his aid , the lamentation hears .
Ripe fruits , and lonely couch , contentment gave ;
Instant without disturb they took alarm ,
The pleasant river gushes
There are echoes that bore us , like blues ,
The trumpet lies in the dust .
It is gone to-day
As if wise nature had made that her book .
A wicked whisper came , and made
All little sounds made musical and clear
And these worlds are ever turning ,
As death among them drew .
For mastership did strive .
Life seemed a toy to break and mend
Full of waking dreams , shall pass .
And the cool morn succeeds the breezy night ,
Of thought that has not ripened into speech .
And there comes no answer in arch or dome ,
No coward e'er hath scaled celestial skies ;
But went on in silence to finish their feeding ,
Their beauty might declare :
The banner of victory to the breezes hurled , --
Unknown to him , this dialogue ensued .
Where mental wealth the poor in thought may find ,
Till thetis ’ sorrows thus began to flow :
From the evils which never arrived .
Pray just think how you took ,
Headlong to deeds of death the hosts are driven ;
Of mirth and toil that hums around ;
He said he could n't make the boy believe
Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate
The sky wore not a frown all day
Hell hath felt a greater heat ;
To wipe the eye of those who grieve ,
Each work of falsehood takes to flight .
He reaches his home with fear and dread ,
Accept the love i offer .
Are those , which make thee beat thy wings below
Death , ruin , ashes tell the awful tale ,
Take my life and let it be
And hushes my soul to rest
Quick came from all the glad reply :
Into their substance pent , which wrought them pain
As all their souls in blissful rapture took :
As on the heroes first they cast their eyes ,
For to the babe that at her bosom clung ,
Looked on her son and made reply :
And when shadows of evening are gathering around ,
Who raise thy temples where the chariot stood
Heart against heart , your fingers wound
As they had been before . a splendour hung
She sobbed so hard i could not pass ,
The son of grief begot by joy ?
That swallowed sea and sky ; and then ,
And , as one mournful look he cast ,
The pride to offer all life holds to thee ;
" that to the full thy knowledge may extend
Swayed on a creaking hinge as the wind bore .
Now in our autumn ; and earth discerns
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn 'd .
The years shall come and pass , but we
This to the lunar sphere directs the fire ,
Into each life some rain must fall ,
Not unto us it has been given to guess
Such as the antique sculptures show ;
And gave the deadly blow .
Though a new helen bring new scars ,
Him seems too little what long he possessed .
Cold i felt the very hearthstones ,
That trembles in a forest place
So blended , sees the life-soul resident
And made all sure enough with holiness .
This wild and wandering heart hath moved ;
The night came down , we thought of rest ;
And from his lips escaped a groan ,
But i struck one chord of music ,
The full moon rising in the east ,
A weak heart yielding to despair .
A summer night descending cool and green
Where lightnings tore the gloom ,
When armed for right , they stood sublime ,
Where love has dropt his burning spark !
If kings and kingdoms once distracted be ,
The breath of the clover brings to me .
Battle he saw , that stood those hosts between .
That the old church tower and belfry made
When eternity 's trial is found to be near .
But since the naked will obtains thy smile ,
That earth holds aught of grief or stain ,
The clouds lie brightly curled ;
Who had no voice nor vote in making laws ,
And made my lips and music wed ,
And contented for years no distresses i felt ,
Yet in her heart there held a strife
Driven by the fire within me , now would gain
Now my thoughts gathered from afar
Doom 'd for work the world to roam .
Whence to descry the battle raging still
Piercing the coal-black night , --
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy .
He heard not the rising wind 's menacing roar ;
Rome never looks where she treads ,
Before the mountains came to be .
There fashioned was the fleetfoot stag which laid
For where that evil people dealt the blow ,
The path which duty shows . "
The sun was sunk , and after him the starr
His piercing shaft , and taught thy heart profane
Your heart 's love would keep me warm .
( whenas a moan escapes each soul )
All life is grown to one long street
With blindness linked , did on my vitals fall ;
What flowed from love -- a holy reverence .
When up went the fog , like a curtain ,
Its strong walls blending with the common clay ,
The poet 's vow was told .
So oft the colors changed , went and came .
In after scenes , as i my tale renew .
And turn the stream of nations from its course .
A million new tigers swept south ...
Foeward , as fits a man ;
Sudden the tyrant of the skies returned ;
By the low wind that o'er them sweeps ,
There come to us worse barbarisms
It lifts the mourner from the sod ,
And bacchus , shedding rosy smiles ,
As for myself , and call it true
So that it makes the soul turn unto it .
And all alone went she .
Cold looks attend the meeting --
The hermit monk held solemn word :
Him whose bright hair on high brows clung :
And casts a flash of lightning to the earth .
The frowns that on your brow resided ,
Pierced through and dropping blood for me ,
But in her case they felt a warmer flame ,
His rueful looks upon the corpse he cast
And count their days as wandering signs appear :
May make mad discord of the sweetest song .
Not seraph 's wing for ever soaring
I mark him , how by seraph hosts adored ,
And , ever while the spiritual mill goes round ,
The youth with instruments surround the fire .
All joy , all comfort in thee meet ,
Your master was not made for you ;
Both made of love , -- one , inconceivable
Alone can claim the wreath of patriotism .
The wind threw in his lonely room ;
_ " wherever the sails of peace are seen
But frozen dread pierced through their entrails dear ;
Of loud mirth that scorneth measure --
Star of my heart , i follow from afar .
To give our tourney prize away .
And echoes gathered from a world of years ,
Distinct the martial ditty flowed .
'till care was dismissed and solicitude drowned ,
As seasons passed and years grew old
And every breeze that stirs the leafing tree ,
And wondrous art was built out of the clay ,
Thy mornings showed , thy nights conceal 'd ,
Hath left to thir disputes , perhaps to move
All i have bid its wild notes tell , --
And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore .
Without the court had met , with gentle speech
To answer that which came : and as they sat
Thus seaton deem 'd her childish fancy flown ;
Shine through its lingering clouds of doubt ;
May feel the impress of the deed done here .
Of what god 's purpose made me ! the coward
For naught that sets one heart at ease ,
Plucked off the crown his maker gave ,
But , finding that this kind of manna coldly
Her lovely throat begets a lump ,
The gallows shadow rising dim
The limit fixed of the eternal counsel ,
Their father from his blind eyes rained the tears :
But if he touch to life the one right chord
What makes existence _ really _ nice
This led to giving john his strict directions
But i am caught by ravishing desire
Has only brought you nearer . those things that
That faced my three-plank bed ,
So she tumbled out her guns
Then a strife arose about a trifle , —
And in did come the strangest figure !
Thou ' lt see how of necessity must pass
Sweet the sighs that thrill the lyre ;
The double victory which bestowed that reign .
To her grave these tears are given ,
And so hath gained at length a prosperous height ,
And heavens of love our lives have shed .
But coldly smile , when pitying moonbeams shine --
How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed ;
And thundering welcome gave .
He journeyed , poverty his heritage ,
On him my sins were laid ;
These trades may both be fitted ,
And lightnings played about it in the storm ,
And filling it once more with human soul ?
Now all the tree-tops lay asleep
To thee i bring a heart unchang 'd .
But yet of fortune gained no mastery .
And snared my faith who doubted nought ,
Then rose a yell of baffled hate , and sprang
Where the level marshes lie ,
Death quench , or evil stir ,
I 'll count my health my greatest wealth ,
Before their track lay pastures green ,
Nor of the damsel yet can gather news .
Follow me , feet that keep the pace :
Shall sound your praises to the sky :
Last came a shadow tall , with drooping lid ,
That shudder as they flit from place to place ,
Twilight is here , soft breezes bow the grass ,
Both were mine ! life went a-maying
The earth gives her streams to the sea :
To joy and ease their days they give ,
The argosies of earth their treasures bear --
A sapphire flashing to the sky ,
Summer gave us sweets , but autumn wrought division ?
Eyes can with baleful ardor burn ;
No other words express --
Death hushed that pang for ever : with thee fled
And poplars made a noise of falling showers .
And make me feel it was my sin ,
But wondrous visions drew my curious eye .
Her suitors followed -- all but one --
He opened -- from exuberant spirit --
Gathering up valor , they had sought the tomb ,
Tongues of an ambient gold that lick your skin .
November passed ; and winter , crisp and chill ,
One morn , a riot in the streets arose ,
It always speaks of fame and high endeavor ,
Nay , for he came of ancestry renowned
It passeth vigil and the shadows cleareth .
Can feel a fierce delight ;
When our boat drew homeward filled with flowers .
One band menestheus swift in battle led ,
This gift of sables take as your amends :
Though sea-like o’er the land were spread
Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons
Every flowered speaks louder and louder to thee ;
With loveliest nature all that art can lend .
And careless life , but crowned with a new crown
His loving thoughts to sítá flew :
Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe ,
Thus from a single stock the double stems unfold .
All nature can not match the wonderous shell .
To leanness their countenances grew --
Then made reply : " a conscience overcast
Applauding all , he , as the gates are rolled
Yet when the challenge rang ,
But here or there comes settling day ,
For motley foundling fancies , stolen or strayed ?
And gave its fragrance to the gale ;
And put to proof his high supremacy ,
Cradled in misery , and baptized with tears .
What is it to the gift he gave ,
Only a sweet air breathed to meet
Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging .
The shadows creep , the sun goes
Through all the compass of the notes it ran ,
To every breeze that wandered by ;
They neuer car ’d what danger therein lay .
All come to pay the tribute of their praise
This put poor frog in a terrible fright ,
This , as an offset , stood against the debt
He through it shall touch death .
And whispers of relief , fell on the breeze .
Wild as the winds that round her mountains roar ,
Whence only lying visions leave the night .
His figure stood distinct and his own shade
The gay enchantment was undone ,
Truth forms my tale ; to pleasing truth attend .
Memories long destroyed of men ,
Repeat the movement , as the foot keeps time ?
The drums did beat
And all my pain , my sorrow chased ,
The adriatic billows breaking .
For thee man 's spirit stood
Their silver voices in chorus rang ,
I know thine inmost bosom , and i feel
The golden wind-blown leaves that lie --
Nor spares the coward backs of youth retreating ,
Love not ; they honour equity and right .
That it could turn a summerset on earth ?
From divination where thy merits shine .
One side they make a shelter for the other ;
And then turn critics in their own defence :
He ended , sinking into sleep , and shares
There stuck the boots of young eugene ;
Their oaths profaned , their countries sold ,
On the mat her hands lay idle ,
But that it pass from strong to stronger hand ,
Might sit for hell , and represent the devil !
Didst fervently invoke , and , led by her
Comes the sorrowful wail of the broken of heart ;
But -- stirred , the eye seizes
For catching illogic and whipping error 's
To admiration , led by nature 's light ;
Through gorgeous windows shone the sun aslant ,
The credulous heart can cheat or blight .
Where female beauty strikes the trembling chord ;
A couching lion lay .
Against her beauty would stake all the world .
By him the recent corse was thrown .
The looking on it lifts the heart like wine .
Peace her white wings will spread over their tomb ;
With signals the darkness is starred .
And she dropped me a curtsey .
That winds along the vale below !
And deem myself adorned with immortality :
Some spread their sails , some with strong oars sweep
To share that bliss he can alone bestow .
Their deathless feats in gallant arms resound ;
It works unknown to any sense ,
Will dreary hours never leave the earth ?
Far-called our navies melt away --
Makes him unjustly hate and blame the rest .
Though the wind hath fallen , they drift along ,
And she thought of christ , who stilled the wave
Good fortune surely follow me
The quaint relief of mirth that plays
Heroes lay the tyrants low !
With this he draws the ghost from hollow graves ;
Interrogation till it hit the mark ,
Some minds are tempered happily , and mixt
The weak , and pitying them sent sweet hope ,
From which a woman 's life is spun .
What gracious words she found to say .
Till the echo that followed its flow
The empire of our race to hold .
There may come some weary soul , o'erladen
Still got new lies , or tidings very scant .
Thus gay equipt , his bosom proudly swelling ,
A heart that stirs , is hard to bind ,
Alone you take your homeward track ,
But water wears the rocks , and sense
And thus replied , to anger stirred :
But to us comes no cheering ,
And with far other struggles worn , here sit
As sure as the sun gives us light ,
Louder they talk , and louder come the strains
This action has released him from those confines . "
The dreary vacuum in my life to fill ,
Each race has died and lived and fought for the
And set my heart as sentry there
Should injure my nerves and prevent me from sleeping ,
When you are made ridiculous ; will find ,
Her sorrows they would stay .
To shame that follows lawless deed :
As its pulses struck on my side .
Dropping upon our weariness ,
And from his splendor steals its fairest hue ,
" we come on the confines of death . "
You bear a just resemblance of my fortune ,
Social we sit , and share the genial rites .
And still in turn i gave him voice to pray
The plainest cap is somehow touched with caste .
Drawn by coursers nine in number ,
The flower that once has blown for ever dies .
The mercy of the wound you dealt . asleep ,
So sorrowful i pass my life ,
Or the wreck that struck last tide --
He made a bid th ' uncommonest
With eyes that fill too listlessly for tears .
Thy birthright was not given by human hands :
A score of stout hands rose between
What if the sun should keep his gold ?
And here and there disclosed a brave neglect .
Yet nature shrank from the last agony :
But with flutes of fear they filled the ear ,
Erroneous , which in blazing ruin fell
Ida 's long ridges sighed , sobbed clamorous streams
A ladder is given by god , at birth ,
In the end he gets a thrashing .
That you serve humanity .
Is all that tells of her story ; yet
Could i unto thy fever have applied ,
But , the victory won , delighted
Had taken the oath of fealty .
No earthly power can ever crush them ,
Where the veiled purple buds may lie .
And with sad brow that showed his pain
Thy kindred appellation comes , and who ,
Our monarch , as the laws appoint ,
I took what front there was beside . i knelt
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn ;
Twelve ships attended me , and ev'ry ship
They throw in drummer hodge , to rest
If innocence and truth can claim desert ,
Will i evade , nor give thee false reply ,
Of rights that urged them to the fray ;
Meanwhile , do you find that surprising ?
Where the wind came blowing merry and chill ;
When men the honours of their race commend ,
Comrades , give a cheer to-night ,
Nor love can change what death can not --
It is the force that bids emotion roll ,
All whom we love in thy tenderness keep !
And blindness waits not there for lingering age .
From the hard season gaining : time will run
Thy vows austere have won our grace .
The snow rose , the last rose
Emerge new mountains or new oceans rise .
Till the slow plague shall bring the fatal hour .
A wild hosanna shook the world
With burning cries and yearning
Of fancy rise full springing : but not mine
Nor yelling winds that with them fly ;
Some day more kind i fate may find ,
With passions into ashes turned ,
Perhaps , when live birds find the way ,
Then plunged into the fight .
All things are touched with melancholy
And the heart that holds no fear .
Runs now that path of god .
But the last dying spark of existence went out .
And still they deemed the dance above was law ,
And with chains of flowers have bound
It was her will that would not take defeat ,
In the days long since departed ,
Hardly at first her senses grasped the words
Such kindly thoughts my fainting hopes revive ! --
That stabs the sense like a sudden scream ;
Open thy mind to that which i reveal ,
To give you , soldiers , liberty and law
While this life within them lingers .
But of his light the beam , must needs attract
Before the stars have left the skies ,
The eager hands stretched out to clutch the prize ,
And brought music , mirth , and gladness ,
A prophecy , of fatherhood to come ;
That by rough wheels rudely shaken ,
My soul , disdainful and disgusted , sought
How far to make the money go .
O thou , whose word from solid darkness struck
And motley shadows dance along the sheet . --
Waxing more fierce and fell the combat rages ,
Silence , and with these words attention won .
His hide he scratched ; the bees rushed out ,
The glorious beauty of his face would shine .
Now missing him , their joy so lately found ,
And coals that burned like love aglow .
A kind of change came in my fate ,
When sudden up the aisle there came a face
When a lumbering noise from behind made him start ,
The ancient hope that still will rise again --
And over the hill lies music yet unborn .
Each atom sought its sep ' rate class ,
While rage flashed furious in the elfin eyes ,
From all that fate has brought to me
The new world 's chain lies broken here !
Should i have passed the limits of sin ?
Be master , and the tower in ruin laid ,
The ferns creep out ' mid mosses cool ,
Her father 's glorious deeds appear ,
This human clear , as that divine concealed --
Yet not in either lies the curse :
Each to his lips applied the nectar ’d urn ,
The peace his childlike spirit ever knows .
And , inviting the world to see punishment done ,
Leading to life 's achievement ; not god 's wrath
Goes gaily tripping to the brook ,
Yet take these tears , mortality 's relief ,
Reached england , edward burroughs , having boldly
How i shall draw her picture -- the young heart
And gloomy clouds are gathering fast .
Pollutes the air that breathes around your homes .
And belief that stood on unbelief
A cry from earth rose long and shrill ,
Who had fought his fight and the foe withstood .
Some flowers that decked the barren , sterile place
What thing he is weaving there in the dark .
But fiery conflict arduous employ 'd
" who show these different traits and tricks
Radiant highways whose vistas gleam ,
And with the winds gone gossiping --
Merry christmas always brings .
That holds the race in thrall .
Now came still evening on , and twilight gray
To lay their just hands on that golden key
For this it was that tears filled my eyes .
Wild legends new and old burn round my bed
" should the torpedo take effect ,
On first looking into chapman 's homer
She fainting fell , through mingled grief and fear .
Disturb the wave that ran so clear .
It filled the listening heavens with prayer .
That he seldom found courage to injure a worm .
And added length to solemn sounds ,
To all an equal lot heaven 's bounty gave :
The voice of fame awakes the soft desires .
With all his rainbows paling in the prime ,
Thrive terror and theft set free ;
Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart . "
And choked with vapours feels his bottom glow .
Each to hold in measure just ,
Upward there fly innumerable sparks ,
In force alone for laws of nations look .
Answered in the words which follow :
To lift him up through wonder into joy ?
Beloved , all my despairs come back !
About him made he many a winding course ,
Upon thy brow it stands .
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three :
Searching about , on a rich throne he fand
That comes as comes the evening psalm ,
There was no bliss drew nigh to her ,
My well is bitter , cast therein the tree ,
What depths of woe your pitying eyes have seen !
Through enigmatic doors voluptuous accents breathed ,
Pleasant beneath the thorn to lie ,
With new sweet charms fell on the ear ;
Free and joyous his accents fell ,
Whereto her great heart bows ;
Whence fall the roofs a ragged plain
That awful pause , dividing life from death ,
Across the moonlight sets me aching ,
All of my lost hopes seem
A truce , the victor 's crown to show .
Evanescent colours showing ,
Clotho , to thee this lay be sung !
But little stars may hide them when they list .
They came to correct , and they came to chastise
Both similar blessings bestow ;
The danish windows shivered and broke
He looked ; such pallor touched his cheek ;
Yet i feel that the gray will blow
For following the cry came flame ,
Their arms laid down , strife into exile sent .
So , ye may doucely fill the throne ,
Make haste and leave thy business and thy care ,
Truth shall restore the light by nature given ,
Of the joy and peace that you have given :
Silent and straight the waters run .
Thus addressed the ancient louhi :
And mirth revive , and brighten as whilere .
Till the dear spring had run its eager race ,
First to the envoy 's he directs his pace .
The bells my coming did proclaim , }
Another soul set free and purified . )
The 24th stanza reads ,
Our hearts with joy shall fill .
He laid the hand of love upon his shoulder ,
Find utterance in her beauty . that fair head
Fashioned to lead where strife gives way to strife ,
Summer shall flush with poppy-fields in bloom ,
In places where no man his strength may spare ;
To rhyme i make but small pretence ,
But if here the flowers may see
As in his spring narcissus tooting laid ;
And reconciled all qualities which grace man ,
Reach upon reach of burial -- so they feel ,
Casts down the bondage wound his eyes above ,
Has tainted with its slimy trail of hate --
His brother brings him his auxiliar waves .
Once laid its consecrating hands ;
And the big tears roll trickling from her eyes .
That heaven , igniting , wildly seemed to flare
When night overshadows her cot in the glen ,
And wetting half the golden hair that lay
And customs o’er the world that reign ?
I put my trust in mine own heart .
To hold myself in spirit of thy sweet kin ,
Two little seeds sank deep in the earth ,
That stood a comfort to his spirit then ;
A sighing always through my laughter crept ,
Her all but utter whiteness held for sin ,
Again she mourned , again salt tears she shed .
That burgeoned all about us : gold and blue
Affection bends the judgment to her ply .
What power is this that comes to birth
Clear as the painter 's art can dress ;
And as our fortune sinks , our wishes soar .
The billows in angry fury shall rise ,
The chargers such a rough encounter made ,
So he made a terrified goose jump through
But facts alone will now prevail :
We gather out our natures like a cloud ,
“ a form assuming such as lilies wear :
To make the nuptial preparations . then ,
Fades when the wind hath lifted them aside ,
Turns what was once romantic to burlesque .
The imperfections of the work i see ;
Or to deny , or to make otherwise ;
Of solomon he led by fraud to build
At first i caught hold of the wing ,
And wax and leather keep the lordship then .
The long harpoon upheld to men :
And the whole deck put on its leaves again .
And melts my passion 's mortal cry
Where the light of life has fled ,
" because he felt so fixed in truth . "
Of meteors shot through murky air ,
While not a rascal comes to ease my woes ?
I would not heed or feel the blight ;
That this sorrow may escape thee ,
Where coward feet now faintly falter ;
His own coevals took but little note ,
Through satan 's eagerness to drive him wrong ;
That shot effulgence like the solar ray ,
Some dire misfortune follows close behind .
And lakshmaṇ , with affection meet ,
Of all my ornaments -- each amber bead holds fast
By this one revelation given .
Tell me a life 's devotion may efface
Till fancy coloured it , and formed a dream .
Have found the fame your shores refuse :
That leads to nature 's great metropolis ,
The greeks shall find you easier far to slay .
The age of man thrust back unfathomed years ,
And fell into a swooning love of him .
The workman is that moment lost .
The dream that comes , the wish that goes ,
For , see , a rainbow spans the sky :
Feeling the vengeance that her warrior felt ,
Nor grudge th ' alliance i so gladly made .
Hundreds swell his joyous shout ,
Where time for time doth restitution make . "
" and follow till i reach my home ;
Caught on the word 's sharp angles flash the
To keep me happy all the day .
Or laughter , or francesca , made them bright .
Fast and far the chariot flew :
Ere change was felt : and then one summer day
Had favour shown to your infernal plan ,
Such weakness and folly , with malice combined ,
Our purpose and our power belong ,
Forsooth no solitary laurel can it claim .
My love laid on my bosom as i slept !
A cloud lay cradled near the setting sun
As if her soul had shrunk and died ,
For in its dust red rivers flowed ,
" so held this king to the customs old ,
The breach of hospitable right may rue .
Full on their fronts our flashing lightnings blaze ;
He saw wheels break and work run back
The dusk wood covered me utterly .
Held commune with herself , and while she held
No burning faith i find ;
Again comes the pessimist , grumpy and grim ,
That leads through fairy worlds astray ,
That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs ,
Thy laws that made a mart of blood ,
The languid days drooped autumnwards .
Heaven itself seemed shown to me in gleams .
Feature by feature it took its place :
Tried to make her people happy . "
Is forced for every carat to abate ,
Cold , from the north , has gone
One little town stood , white on a hill ,
Alive with sparks that hissed and flamed ,
And by degrees from underneath it came
Proud rivers leap when you ride on their breast .
A tyrant 's bondage for his land prepared ;
Beneath the green paws finds itself again ;
Anxiously hermann turned and signed to his ally the pastor
Vengeance for all thy malice shown to me .
Then comes the struggle for degrees ,
Man makes a death , which nature never made ;
Mother , vexed , did whip her next ,
Stand up and meet the war .
The lesson nature teaches ;
That opened to them , she awhile did wait ,
And watch the sea come creeping in ,
And floating forests paint the waves with green ,
And truth conveyed in verse of gentle kind
In name and fame , finding my hoarded gains
That morn which saw me made a bride ,
It is not the fourth figure the furnace showed ,
Turning evenings into days ,
And through our blood there runs
And music , sown along the hardened ground ,
But soon those pleasures fled ;
_ that which draws it above _ ,
My mind could relish what it might have sought ,
The boy held his breath suddenly .
And still that awful mouth did toss them up :
It 's the stillness that fills me with peace .
The love i hold was borne by her ;
So strange a dream hath come to me ;
And brought foul scandal on the holy faith .
Bring less of bloom than in days gone by ?
Nor change of mind the varying seasons bring :
Sound and entire , mark well the lore conceal 'd
A dread example given ,
There stood the pride of janak ’s race
True woman-heart can take --
And the pale minstrel 's passion lived again ,
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;
Status and her own property retains .
My voice magenta 's charges sped .
The fates that gibe have lessoned us ;
The buried voice in trembling accents sighs .
" we show 'd our republican courage ,
They suffered and kept themselves pure .
Followed the stream that followed him .
All earth can take or heaven can give .
There lives more fragrance , and more freshness now ;
By feeling more or less the eternal breath .
Across her silent cheek there came
Answered in the words which follow :
Thir deities to assert , who while they feel
Thy fit companion in that land of bliss ?
A sound must long remain ;
New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail ;
White star that rose amid the battle 's flame !
Winter passed , and the summer came
And all an aspect of contentment bore ,
-- and the river of passion deepened ,
There found they all by sleep subdued ; their arms
The vine still clings to the mouldering wall ,
England , in this great fight to which you go
" on bethlehem our suspicion falls ,
Paulinus took it by tears and remorse ;
That the next hour steals away .
I pass from earth i shall find welcome there .
The tripod , ceased not struggling for the prize .
Midst flowers and fields hearing what nature says .
Forward as far as ever eye could stretch
And wait for my ship to come in .
't is seized with conflagration and distends
That made monotonous burden to their rhymes ,
Whose sweet follies formed the hero 's trust ;
Then gave the signal to the willing guest :
Does the snow hide the sea ?
His figure such as might his soul proclaim ;
But other groves the hand of time shall raise ,
Whereon the blood of goats was shed ,
The joys thy love has given ,
The hand that held the glaive ,
When violently the clouds are weighted down
Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown ;
O wretch that heavenly warnings dost reject ! '
One waiting thus , even as it comes to pass
Should lose your franchise : we do dislike bribery ;
The maiden no more it can hold .
Would make a cockle happy .
Their baleful zeal had come about ,
Woe shook the troubled heart of each ,
Amid the circle now each champion stands ,
But kisses thrown from heaven to win us back ?
Of lively portraiture displayed ,
So i till twice seven years are spent
That desolating thought which comes
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
The grief the maiden bore .
Around him threw . the hero toil-inured
From voice to voice should pass along the lines .
Well may the haughty damsel her worthiness assert .
The far sky shed into thy cage ,
Troy yet found grace before the olympian sire ,
Dreaming of days that pass like almoners
For land that drops the rosy day
And furious longing seized his soul
Take form : each one the peer
While the glory of many shaken flames
The royal orders said " no , no !
It brings a sadness to my heart
There lie the chambers of guilty delight ,
Taught by apollo 's self to draw the bow .
And make us more anxious each day to renew
Which meets contempt , or which compassion first ?
My thought , and hold thy valor light
They would follow the sign their banners bore ,
And virtue 's power ; we felt with holy awe
Of joys now lost and charms now fled .
Philadelphia laughed till she caught her breath again .
Touch the crude line with fear ,
I felt that i could fly through air ,
Heavy my heart is , heavy to carry ,
From rainbow clouds there flow not
A shout of gladness broke .
A fleet had come upon them . each gave up
A little while i lie upon his heart ,
When death bestows the martyr 's crown ,
But hurchin cupid shot a shaft ,
For sadder tidings never touch ’d thy ear ;
I have bid you share my victory or defeat .
In hollow tones was pealing ,
With him the points of liberty , who made
The first scene discovers a wild wood .
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran ,
With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels .
When we hate falsehood and spurn it ;
The horrid shock : now storming furie rose ,
And wreak the wrong his wrath had wrought .
Their quest hath found end in thee ,
Could yield his spirit that for which it panted ,
To take the statute from the mind
Who does the best his circumstance allows , 44 .
All the fragments come together
For nature knew no right divine in men ,
But fed his strength upon the naked earth .
Full closely to the fire she drew ;
Passions more calm to flow were taught
Love taught my tears in sadder notes to flow .
From whose seed sprang the sacred dust ?
Her soul once trod in angel-guise ,
And lifts his voice through the wintry blast
And scorned the insults heaped upon his corse .
The diamond coated angels kindle as they go .
And all that went down doing their duty ,
When evening is come ,
Who fall upon fido and squash little florrie ,
Lightly took his labour , lightly took his pleasure ,
When curses wander 'd to and fro .
That curved these lips into this subtle smile ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Grief seized , at sight of his retiring friend ,
The amrit to the toilers gave .
And here when all the noon hangs still ,
They draw their bows at venture . brave men love
Brings many a loved friend to our sight ,
They gently lay their burden down .
He saw his weakness when his sight was dim ,
Taught them ; but they his gifts acknowledged none .
Though to the childless wife there clings
For which the human race keep such a coil !
Too sorely heavy is the debt they lay
Is mine , and sometimes dull as clay it sleeps
In simplest word the truth which all may see ,
The thoughts that burned and glowed within .
Your palaces rise from the fruits of our toil ,
Till order bright completely shine ,
And clasping vines their grateful umbrage lend .
Your voice curved softly , a caress --
When joy lay dead and hope was blind ,
In losing me , you might yourselves be lost .
And at once the sweat broke over my brow :
Our country hath a gospel of her own
And along came the same wolf as before ,
Up sprang the king -- the moon 's uncertain ray
First enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls
To watch the silent worlds that crowd the sky .
From the wars my father brought it ,
Blossoms waved among the grasses ;
Unsolved while bending ' neath the mortal ban ,
To all my questions make reply :
Hands are lying in carnations ,
Knocking at last , the gradual echoes stir
As when i fell a-sleeping : --
His colour came and went again .
Slow swung the verdant gates neath saddest eyes .
Turning , my heart was pierced with more intense
Her apron gave , as she did pass ,
The dictates of my mind , therefore attend .
And hide no secret from you in my heart .
Home went the peasant in the western sun ;
Again he troubled jove with prayers :
The ocean waters -- lashed into waves .
And smashed , to cleanse the world of guilt .
And wrath which endures not rest ,
The rosy clouds that float o'er dying daylight ,
Where i passed my days of girlhood ,
Unlike successes equal merits found .
Cats go gay in capes and shawls ;
The spreading cloud of incense soared ,
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven .
And some , whose sunny hopes have fled ,
Of passage ; where their instinct leads
And echoing groans that shook the lofty tent :
That told youth 's heartfelt revelry ;
Invite you there to share immortal bliss
Still on its slopes the ploughman 's ridges show
Above a field of battle stretching wide .
As this eternal jade wears me ;
They break their manacles , to wear the name
Shall i make inventory of thy grace ,
Knights of the rosy cross , they bore
Is charged with human feeling , human thought ;
And terence left his latest rhyme
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies ;
Past twice a thousand miles of shifting sea ,
Than these dear manors give ;
For i in death will follow thee .
That made up for all and a world of clay
Thou has taken hence one hostess ,
The love in her eyes lay sleeping ,
With like confusion different nations fly ,
Queen mary 's saying serves for me --
To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark 'd !
A glorious host that region held ,
Within the rooms the eager insects flew ,
Nor may my soul the dread assault sustain :
Content thy perfect love to feel ,
To roll along the great machine of war .
How many empires had their rise and fall !
The songs that make her grieve .
To pass with her a merry joke ,
To come again if all go well with thee ,
That trembling into fulness shine ,
As agonies follow :
Like pipes of battle calling up a clan ,
Ere time that breaks all men has broken
Breaking the horrid silence , thus began : --
Thy beauty shall no more be found ,
Still it whisper 'd promised pleasure ,
My days concluded , i might ' scape the pain
It lies on her heart , and lost must be
The watch now muster strong and dare
“ echoing our forceful conflict ; flashing flames
And fell into a swooning love of him .
As the blush stole up its fringe to meet .
Through all the winter wears and wears them out .
On earth to wage a warfare against heaven ,
Gray skies have turned to brilliant blue ;
Twould bring my last campaign ;
Their very shadows make us yield ;
A guitar , and words that thrill
A year has gone and the moon is bright ,
Love gives it energy , love gave it birth .
Age might but take the things youth needed not !
Even the tall poplar hung stone still .
And to augustus they so spread the flame ,
And then proceed to what else was objected .
By vienne and valence next took his way ,
One morning , intending to take but one peep ,
This on her hand the cyprian goddess laid :
But oh ! what spring can raise them up ,
To the bush comes the bud ,
War-music bursting out from time to time
The eye sustained his aspect for long while ;
Each parasite , then , as in duty bound ,
Of launcelot then thoughts grew on ,
Where weary men their thirst may slake .
He looked in vain , then set himself to wait
That crumbled a sky-blue foam on long shores
And evere among he axeth grace ,
Though the chilly frosts may fall ,
When love dies within the heart .
The sports of glory to the brave belong
To make a grand speech ,
Then silence fell , and where the low cloud hung
Sorrow and i took up our load , and past
To quicken the flame in the western skies --
Deeply has sunk the lesson thou hast given ,
The day wound up with booze and blow
So it kept the troublesome tartars out .
A law ca n't reach the legislature .
So surely touched by others ' pain or woe ,
A heavenly voice breathed round her from above ,
Wit grew polite , and numbers learned to flow .
I would not lead you willingly astray ,
They passed to freedom through a flood ,
Its beauty born to die ,
But veteran belles and wits gone by ,
While on the wind the chimes come cheerily ,
How has his armor battled with the snows !
The day passed on into night 's dark shade ;
All bound for happiness ; yet few provide
The strangest whim has seized me ... . after all
And europe saw , rejoicing in the sight ,
The wrecks of the combat of titans were spread .
But from the juice that made them wise
Whose preaching invites one to sleep .
And thurgh fortune it fell him so ,
That of necessity my sleep was broken .
I own a solace shut within my heart ,
The fetter 's mark lay heavy and dark
Misfortunes come and burn like flame ,
Pierced the thick battle , and provoke the war .
She leaves these objects to a slow decay
Through barky walls have slid away ,
The human soul that through me ran ;
And stem the currents with your struggling oars ;
While rallied to your valiant side
It passed into thy lifelong regency .
Forth rush ’d the youth with martial fury fired ,
And that even wild geese find a nest .
But still the notes on lamia hung --
To carry far the colours of his queen ,
The moon and stars at once withdrew their light ,
The clouds of anger hanging o'er his brow
Next tripping came a courtly fair ,
And perfect beauty did at first proceed .
With the deluge of summer it receives ;
And put their trance to flight ;
Catch added beauty from the afterglow .
Whilst all the house my passion reads ,
Own each quaint likeness issuing from the mould
That made anon of black and red and ruin
And first , and joy in flying laces lay .
And drew the wonder of the gazing throng .
How far your genius taste and learning go .
His hordes to fall upon thee . he shall send
It covers but not hides the sky .
" equal honors must be given
With pretty sport we pass the day :
But the years , that take the best away ,
For these are streams no furnace heat may quench ,
The following pages reproduce the two concluding lectures of a
By my late fervent vow sustained ,
Bit his lip and changed the subject .
While as the fly gives place unto the gnat )
There came a people face to face with these ,
Our love where we spent our toil ,
That clasps thy shore , and the soft evening gale
And soothed each wound which pride inflamed : --
Semichorus . thick they come and thicker ,
And climbest : spaces spread about thee ,
In ancient times , as story tells ,
For , catching courage from the cavalier ,
And takes his way beneath the lady 's lead .
Those within the house shed tears
Phoenicians ! true , that name is found within
To sway the souls of men .
Fearing his joy too great to last .
Thus ráma gave his sorrow vent ,
And sought the mourner 's side again .
Bold truths to speak , and spoken to maintain ,
The time of pledges draws apace ,
Spring and the wandering breezes say
On the sombre rafters , that round him made
The snow sails round him as he sings ,
Savage and shrill ! but with the breath which fills
An ' virtue will respect thee .
But drew no watchers from the drowsier farms .
The mutual thought , -- we stood and pledged
The soul comes floating in a tide of gore .
" it means the loosening all the doors , "
A great example drawn from times of old ;
A theory of theft it found .
And each bud , breaking from its silver bond ,
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
The one i hated most : his eye he swept
“ not rush the bears upon the stronger herds .
With eyelids twitching to tears and with eyes grown tender
Now in mute stillness rested all the air :
Answer in the words which follow :
That my vengeance shall not reach him ! "
The empire shall be held in high respect . "
His treasures lay outspread .
A youth with a little blue wren held speech .
Who poured their blood , to purchase from the foe
Wild send thee pleasure 's devious way ,
' what will bring the effervescence ,
Than all the mirth unfeeling folly wears .
For the holy land where hearts should go .
Some summer night i shall fall asleep ,
Still feel the breeze down ettrick break ,
Yea , not a kiss which i have given ,
And billows following billows , as they raved
To the same warbling of fresh waters drew ,
It suited well her palate when she ate ;
From friends the fleeting years have bound to
Here the bones of birth have cried
Beyond us some short space , in answer came .
For with my courage now my strength agrees . '
So like a serpent 's tongue thrust out ...
Ere spain should nip it , ere the mighty host
From my heart i give thee joy , --
Scarce stole a breeze to wave the leafy spray ,
And in a second 's pause there fell
And with the words a thrilling power was borne ,
Twas late , and the gay company was gone ,
` that takes delight in any devious course ?
And set without a cloud .
And in the fall of tears she found relief --
Since yet the early hour of night allows
The beauty which had moved the wide levant ,
Hope , upon which before my thoughts were fed ,
The cross of christ to share ?
Bare , rimed pine-woods murmured lament .
Seems to echo the far-away calling of children
But the wings that lift her and bear
Whose might made the whole world pale ;
And pelted me with spring .
Stirred by the wandering breath of life 's pure dawn
And by her pangs these resolute ghosts are stirred .
One morning , intending to take but one peep ,
And fill us with a rapture indescribable in words ;
And mutter 'd vows , and mystic song applied
Making angles with the root ,
Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill .
Leads the sad heart through valleys dark as night ,
She shines on thieves on the garden wall ,
'till its dark line is lost ,
He shows a mind that ’s verily commanding .
They cried with voices raised aloud :
Brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth
The hurricane had swept the glen .
By love -- he meant philosophy -- resolved .... "
Lost in remembered loves , yet thou more thou
Sends forth a horrid laugh , that dies away ,
With glory lent by heaven alone ;
But each new comfort gave them fresh delight ,
This spiteful ray which still upbraideth me
It does not follow he permits them now ,
And the brows that the badge of freedom bore ;
Man feels as man , the earth is beautiful .
How leaps the lighten 'd heart to seize
Boyling with swelling waves aloft did rise ,
The wise sumantra thus addressed ;
From his fleshly home he had gone to roam
With dances meet us on the yellow sand ;
What none but bad men wish exploded , must .
The path that its shade has drawn .
Peace comes , and discord flies away ,
Who stood her guardians in the bloody strife ,
Soft brooklets burst their icy chain :
So here eternal fire was pouring down ;
The snail regards both fruit and flower ,
And therefore thou hast borne the passing pangs ,
She her vows had plighted ;
It pleases in passing the people of earth ,
Stark-stately he the evening wears .
Of violets that nodded to
But when night came , she wondered , fell asleep
Was stirred in wild unrest ,
Which from those hands angelical ascended ,
Contentment , light , within : his life is merged
My mother gave to me , the deeds i did
Not on thy pity for my pain to call .
Over her lips his kiss was laid ,
Whose grandson took it , as a last bequest
The passion that absorbed his soul .
Let the fragrant onion go ;
Green lanes that shut out burning skies
In which life sees her face --
Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore ;
Nor felt it as the shadow cast from god ?
Sweetly , sweetly blew the breeze --
Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet ,
Low in the dust thy boasted beauty lies ;
The soul from the body flew : darkness of death
And i 'll roses give to thee !
Freedom 's blest cause that brought me here :
The world will view it angrily ;
The sweetest rhyme would fail to utter .
That came in dreadful state between
In whom my loving hopes were stored ,
So vanish friendships only made in wine .
Took back her soul freed from spot or stain ,
Contented , in the falling gloom ,
And what large pleasures smile upon and bless
To underlie each sorrow of the race .
Stole all the sweetness ether sheds
His eyes with tears ran over ,
And pays the debt of gratitude .
We draw the characters to mark thy tomb .
Put on a glory , and my soul expand .
The far-flown songs come sounding slowly !
Her limbs , so long with pain oppressed .
To take the place of lausus . driving through
Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground .
I , worn by years , am older far
Across the sky the lightning made mad play ,
To starve or sink from out the desert world .
Is used to stamp and hallow printed fact ;
Redundant bliss ! which fills that mighty void ,
Health is failing , wish you 'd die --
Where the tall grasses toss .
She looked on , and her looks went everywhere .
They pant and struggle in the moving gold .
And horror was shed round me ; when my knees
Waiting to seize the splendour from my hand ,
Till the new age shall feel her cold heart beating
As morning drinks the morning star .
Stills memory and gives me strength to live ,
Bill 's sympathies never were stirred :
Against the thoughts of man ; he turns to flight
For i shall feel the sting of ceaseless pain
The crack of earthquake shivering to your base
And brought him beat and broken from the lists
And rise into sublimities of thought .
He set in his bosom a dove of flight --
And steals a kiss from luna as she nods
That independence we had sworn to gain ,
Thy blossom of beauty was borne ,
The question , make the knowledge fuller ! lo ,
So turn our hearts , as on we rove ,
Each following his own thought , -- around us darkening
After mirth , and he brought back sorrow
And in sledges bring the cripples .
Might use some secret of his cunning lore ;
To welcome those who make his blood then stay ,
Nor insolence assumes fair freedom 's name :
We gave no other bond .
To take a smooth answer ,
And so let sinners purge themselves of sin . "
That stately age yet holds aloof .
This pain that makes earth paradise ,
There grew desire passionate and strong
This bottle , for instance ... " i recall ,
A father 's uncheck 'd feelings gave
Love lent her feet the wings of winds to reach
There was a navy went into spain ,
And led my sad heart o'er the sea !
The natural mists shall gather ,
Exulting troy with clamour fills the fields :
The spirits of fun which young patrick pursued .
And force me to a smile .
With atlantean shoulders fit to bear
Which serves to make the silence audible .
Here justice holds us prison 'd , hand and foot
Plunge headlong in the tide to quench the fire .
And clouds our breath has made obscure the day .
What struggle passed , what victory gained ,
For to meet his fate with a valiant heart .
In many a languid bloom , bowed to the moon
And wake an interest , when description fails .
He found that the vengeful old wizard ,
In love the ruddy hue declares great heart ;
A little wind was stirring in the trees ;
Each in his patent urn for ever laid ,
There no rude winds presume to shake the skies ,
On the bride and the wedding he made ;
When buds the light or folds its grace ,
Where behind sunset hills a stately city lies .
But count our freedom for their prize ,
With blunders he makes ,
And all the wizard things that go
Peace brimmed the skies , a cool and fragrant air
Luridly glaring through the smoke of war ,
Till it pierced the clouds in growing
That more than words expressed ,
Some new equation given ;
Tonight as i was riding on a wave
That with their weight they make the balances
With greater torments then it me doth take ,
They swung to face the fray ;
With flickering strings which scatter melody ,
The jagged clouds blew chiller yet ;
Quick was he follow 'd by confederate ships
The wind went wooing the rose ,
By three times thirty steps is led
When genuine virtue fires the stubborn soul ;
As a silver stream may run ,
His eyes beheld what made him faster run
Now a wicked course pursue ;
Speak aloud the words which follow :
Into this hostile spot . the dim wolds lay
For joys for which he deems us fit :
My promise of assistance gave .
" the fire still burns that threats
Which made divinely sweet our intercourse ;
To drive the cold winter away .
And the fiery steed sprang forward ,
Whereby his gentle thoughts all filled were
But the moon shed forth no lustre ,
Draw forth the cheerful day from night :
The fold , if i the guard am made ?
The moving words telemachus attends ,
The stern centurion hid a starting tear ;
In gloomy noddings over life ! they pass .
To him the mansion 's master made reply ,
Of life was cut , and closed thy span !
He turned him to his evening prayer ,
That made it stir on the shore .
Straightway sings the songs that follow .
And the road i took was a troubled way .
When thus to bitter grief returned ,
And in the song it mingled . and the dame
And so hath kept , steered by the guiding star
Wherefore associates he with sinners vile ?
Nor grammar 's protests change a word of it .
And twined sweet blossoms with her golden hair ,
In visions of those skies from whence love sprung .
You turn , and own that all is lies .
Who sees a glory , towards it will go .
It snaps the fetters and expands the wings ,
He long 'd himself to reach his final hope ,
And though , by wasting years , it fade ,
And folly , doctor-like , controlling skill ,
My thoughts on former pleasures ran ;
A heart that stirs , is hard to bind ;
And faith is swallowed up in love .
And in did come the strangest figure !
Came the spring , and all the forest
Which led up to the palace he ascends .
To know that truth whose knowledge can not save ?
The sighing winds , in protest , moaned beware !
Which pleasure spreads enticingly around .
That passion never can die from love ,
And she returns his love in open shame ;
Filling me with wondrous bliss .
Declared by throbs the love i bore
And solemn voice , the priest directs his prayer :
Her heart lay waking till the morn .
No son her barren womb shall bear :
So adam comfort finds , not knowing strife !
And gained as fruit sweet tastes of heavenly bliss .
Two on my right their watches keep ;
And sometimes , just to catch the breeze ,
For in her eyes was burning such a smile
And convent walls to hide her shame .
May go to heaven , whereas the poor and lowly
Give half his years if but he could
Thou muse of music , take my thanks ,
And find a full repayment there ?
The first blow big kamper struck ,
Believing you are ruled . i see too far
Of wealth of beauty framed in golden hair .
Stars that no sun has ever made grow dim !
His own hand planted when an idle boy ,
For the night from heaven never fell so black ,
That led you to your death ,
The furrow ploughed by that strange cannon-shot
And draw from these full eyes of thine
Crop despotisms -- so the jury sees
Until the soul should burst ; a dream so thin
Swayne felding took the sacrament ,
Still make the golden crocus shine
And the gutter snow is gone
Those ribs that held the mighty heart ,
Or creeping years have loosened , down the steep ,
From what once lovely lip it springs unseen !
Each pondering the means to trace ,
Douglas , thy stately form was seen .
Thus the magic bird made answer :
Wilt thou debase the heart which god refined ?
Hearts that beat with love so true !
Calling war upon his bugle ,
And all the glory of your sire regain .
No two virtues , whatever relation they claim .
And the bridges often go .
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
Has met temptation and gained full control .
His fame , to make it theirs :
No rightful plea might plead for justice there :
The chieftain turned his glances where
From his hair the flame was flashing ,
With whom from heaven fair virtue came ,
To offer praises to the best of kings ;
What sport shall we pursue ?
All that life gives and the years let go ,
Round her she made an atmosphere of life ,
The awful symbols borne in either hand ;
" but his new kingdom leaving to his band ,
The instincts born of flesh , shall horror reign
Across the waves while that small fleet went by ,
The pity of the snow that hides all scars ;
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
All others in their loss some comfort find ;
He found a place wherein to plant his brand ;
The air blew rank with the taint of fox ;
I feel my powers already higher , clearer ,
If you can make a halo or eclipse ,
Until cool nothingness receives me ;
Seethes poison -- lifts the sea ;
And kindly books that hold me late .
And sing , tho ' foes may frown .
Whose streams of holiness make glad
Pitying , i dropped a tear :
On bradamant the knight 's suspicions fall .
The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore ;
And 't is the sweetest joy she feels ,
Ravenna hath maintain 'd this many a year ,
Which lifts its diamond head ,
Where karnak 's painted pillars stand ,
Shall fade and pass ,
Yet while it so pleas ’d him to ponder ,
Can give thee one faint gleam of joy ,
Were properly particular about the friends they made ;
As a golden light it shineth
Then catch the moments as they fly ,
Iberia bore him , but the breed accursed
The eye with wonder and amazement fills ;
Who all sustains with providential sway ,
That round about me lay .
It passes , and we stay :
That death in any shape might bring .
To matins joined a mournful voice ,
By putting the rebellious french to rout ;
And place them as the glorious stars
Thus his mournful plaint he made :
I marvel , when thy crime i see ,
Guittone , giving him the prize , till truth
Beside the bed where parting life was laid ,
Doc 's bound to have his joke ! the day
Like gilded ruins , mouldering while they shine ,
Which seemed to descend from the waving trees .
And seven nights could find no sleep , until
From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat ,
Time runs apace : the fleeting years
And lucagus the lofty seat maintains :
Our hearts shall breathe the old refrain ,
That knows not to regret thy bounded power ,
To warm the heart and cheer the soul .
Half-human . never sunlight pierced the gloom ;
As moving lights hide and shine in the marshes .
The birds their notes renew , and bleating herds
Above the mone hath take his bounde ,
Would that keep you , would that hold you ,
And held both parties in an artful smile .
Convicting men of sin ; making faith live ;
She sent an answer back that drew him on .
The tumult and the shouting dies --
The tears so long retained in dewdrops fall .
Describes the flames that round about him roar ,
And then came peace , and gentle beauty came ,
And lowest falls attend the highest flights .
A thing for scornful laughter made .
To plant on sinners chains and pains ;
It oft compassion drew .
As when transported venice lent an ear ,
Shame and fear succeeded then to censure ,
Then off there flung in smiling joy ,
Her cause you pleaded and her ends you sought ;
An iron clasp to set the shining gem ,
And took away the precious breath
She sensed a music sadness in his soul .
If i could lift the reflection ,
His bladder bounced from head to ducking head ,
Or a fit expression find ,
Blest was the sun of joy that shone ,
With piercing cries , and supplicating tears ;
And arm in arm they sociably went .
Assumes th ' organic powers its seed convey 'd .
And immortality through christ restored ;
To see the day of disappointment break ,
What years were given to cherish .
Maim heaven 's perfection , break its equal beams ,
But the twilight has departed ,
Thickly the flakes drive past ;
I felt as one might feel who should behold
Lies there revealed to you
Of pain and sickness , may be made , }
My heart flows like a sea ,
The street-fight shall not reach us here .
Where a winding brook made music ,
Ambition 's self finds every prospect vain ,
Autumn tempests on it beat ,
Freedom 's sword will strongly draw ,
By use and daily meditation worn ;
They came to dismal places , dropped in secret
Here glows the god of battles ; this recalls
Puts on a look of injured innocence ,
Not of june either , though the hanging skies
Enjoys the air it breathes .
That her fury-throat might swallow
Then forth his threatening anger broke :
Like a tried old friend it comes to me ,
Held by the sound of his music ;
Shall find their fables true in us .
Beholds , in fancy , visions pass ,
Thoughts came as pure as light --
My hungry heart will claim them still ;
We crept on knees , and held our breath ,
From these brown hills , have melted into spring !
Be counted happy while men call thee great ,
Nor heat could melt , nor beating storm invade .
That ever wrought a lover 's doom .
And find the real things that lie
Till settling on the current year
Because thy name moves right in what they say .
The tenderness touching -- the grace
That darkness should cover that castle forever ,
" thy loneliness and wanderings i will share ,
" he made your little heart for joy ,
Which is the life of nature , shall restore ,
Making even love in music audible ,
And the breathless land is lying in a swoon ,
Tournaments stricken , and the joustings run ,
It smote the birds upon the wing ,
Has left enough to pay your fee .
Beheld i issue forth a fire so happy
The clamour , mounting high and higher ,
As forced through extreamity of need
Take pity on a sodger .
To dresse my sorrow by .
Here rise a roman pergamus . "
Good pleasure is the pleasure that endures ,
Which told the wrong that bertram 's grandsire did
Then on the vánars fell despair ,
Pigs broke loose , scrambled west ,
My hopes are crost , my lover lost ,
Down which the sun dives to embrace the earth :
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;
And the freighted year must close .
Faintly came her milking song --
She moveth , making earth afraid .
Let me but feel the pulse of nature 's soul
The victory brought orlando small delight ;
That pales the boyish cheek of dimpled cupid ,
The pain of anger punishes the fault :
The power of life was in them set --
As her sad eyes turned upon him
Sound and entire , mark well the lore conceal 'd
Thy zeal was felt along the rugged wild ,
And nile 's seven mouths , disturbed with fear ,
That hath drawn its crimson from hearts in hell .
They go by turns each one unto the judgment ;
In which an antique mansion stood ,
We caught the tread of dancing feet ,
That so with rapture takes my soul ;
The breath that loved to breathe ,
Thy talents open and thy virtues rise ,
Such pain , such anguish to relate
All the meadows wave with blossoms ,
Behind , a dragon ’s fiery tail was spread ;
Hard on my soul the awful knowledge lay ,
On thy majestic altars fade the fires
That kings can feel for human woe .
They shadow with purple thine emerald and gold .
This i shall draw for the abbot 's drinking ,
A brilliant moon sends her cold light abroad :
Is piety thus and pure devotion paid ?
You cast me with street lamps like briars .
Into the mist my guardian prows put forth ,
Two little eyelids cast meekly down , --
Of them who brought glad tidings of the light ,
Britain ! had this not risen like a fate ,
Dropped the low murmur from pale , shuddering lips ,
Religion followed by a witless will
Drawn by coursers nine in number ,
Whose echoes o'er the lake were borne . "
Whence summer smells are struck by all the winds .
Where curling smoke was seen to rise .
The footsteps of my spouse pursue . ”
As comes the morrow fraught with wo to greece .
They bore it sorrowfully along ,
The wild rose sends a honeyed breath
Was bathed in floods of living fire .
In wary wise , intent the truth to find ,
A thousand times they their embrace renew ,
And shrink into a point like death ,
But if some burning tears were shed ,
Too quick and sweet to be reckoned .
That longed to leave the olden scenes behind
The spider plied the weaver 's art ;
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears .
Fresh as the blossoms they carry .
Honor and power it sought , --
And shadowy doubts from dark religion thrown ,
And bitter words are poured upon mine head --
To him your summons comes too late
Such a strain as i can give .
The troubled billows rose on high
His jaws uplifting from their fell repast ,
Saw the ever changing seasons
Mixed with the rack , the snow mists fly ;
Had lured a saint from heaven to hell !
And yet shall lie . life mocks the idle hate
And thirst consumes him ' mid circumfluent waves .
Then fate , alas ! her weapon sped ;
In equal honour held with priam 's sons .
O'er its sad gloom still comes and goes
Though our hearts and footsteps wander far from home .
Whereat the devil took offence ,
Of the blossoms , i assume ,
One showed himself as one of the disciples
Like thee will many others fare ,
Where could their tribes have found security ?
A glory resting on its ancient head .
And there a richer , nobler fane arise ,
Should make an onslaught single on a realm
Now , wavering doubt succeeds to long despair ;
Stops for his comrade , flying from the fight .
Write dull receipts how poems may be made
The holy oath is planted deep and strong
Where joyous full of faith , spreading white sails ,
You think i need to ask for heavenly grace ?
Filled me with ghastly terror and affright .
The toil of thousands in a moment falls .
But breathe revenge , and for the combat burn .
The albatross did follow ,
Will fill the night with prayer .
Demons unhoused , disease and death subdued .
Now fashion , form and fill me
That dreamy lovers send to dreamy mays ,
And what they build may stay ; though i believe
This living , moving wonder which is mine --
For her free will rinaldo can not force .
And giveth happiness or peace ,
His dull eyes might not catch the gold
Of death cast out and life devouring death
Vibhishaṇ comes no crafty spy :
Through stones past the counting it bubbles red hot .
Till vengeful ann returnd his scorn ,
And sleep extended on the naked rock .
That spares a woman ’s helplessness .
The wild wind sighs and sings
On the death she might not share .
But brave hearts , once swept away ,
Out of strange strife thy peace is strangely wrought ;
Whence royal edict rang ,
When you smiled and found it was good :
For blasts would rise and rave and cease ,
To rest its pretty wing --
Not old laertes , broken with despair :
The cavalier swims forth , and makes for land .
Diamonds to meet them , and they past away .
Whatever here is missing , i 'll willingly replace ;
Should seek an uncle , not an ant !
By whom true love 's regarded ,
Dreamily mustering in the tropic bloom .
In the east a cloud let gather ,
And thoughts unuttered stirred within their souls .
And then come fifty , and fifty-five .
The soft moss sleeps upon the stone ,
" two hearts , that wrought with smiles through tears
And all that freedom 's highest aims can reach ,
Formost to stand against the thunderers aime
Dream 'd over hopes that never came !
Nor venus now may crown his heart laid bare ,
Sordidly shifting hands with shades and night .
Of the soft regrets that my verse could say .
My heart would find the years more lonely here .
For things immortall no corruption take .
By trot or amble they set little store ;
With their caps of darkness hooded !
Words fail to explain how embarrassed one feels
When politics came there , to mix
The holiday swell he met .
And lopped his desperate days .
I feel the chill of night or of the tomb
Silence sits often on me as i touch
The hope beyond the grave , is gone ,
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes .
And gave him orders never to make known
Sweet order lived again with other laws :
The death divine , or from this breaking body
Wailing went the wawonaissa ,
The darkness removed silently away ,
And spite of jeers that foes have hurled ,
Lessons that leave no time for prizes .
Stand by to reckon up your battleships
A springtide day hath wept and left
To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares ,
The pledge was taken , the arms laid by ,
So virginal she came with dainty tread ,
While thus the blissful moments rolled ,
Now came still evening on , and twilight gray
Two lovers blow together like music blowing :
But little , or nothing . yet some faces show
That was by moses given unto our fathers .
Obscure they went thro ' dreary shades , that led
Far as distress the soul can wound ,
Pity the fortunes of a falling race .
My cause ; her weary soul looked from within
With strength like his , the trojan hero stood ;
With eighteen sweet summers dissolved in the light
Should give place unto the pale-face ,
Passion and party . courage may be shown
Great the love i bear for her
And thy pains sit bright upon thee :
And so easily the beaks did swallow his pill ,
A little space lies low ;
And now three days the angry gale has blown ,
When all the fires of life are buried low ,
Their english mother made her moan .
But till that comes , i 'll bless the rules
Up goes the price of shoddy .
With all his wisdom pressed
Such chance , long ages had not brought about .
When thy merry step draws near .
Within the pauses of the anthem falls a hush ,
Still it whisper 'd promised pleasure
The moaning wind went wandering round
To express their sympathy , in such dark hour
And claimed from every one their warmest praise .
One word from her distrusted could destroy !
Whose restless strength had swayed her fragile form .
Lulled in its sweet and golden rest it lay ,
And linked itself by carnal sensualty
The breeze blew cool and fair ,
Thus as her breast with fury burned
Of satan and each prowling gnome .
Half choked with rage , king robert fiercely said ,
When sin repented of has been removed . "
Love and respect together must combine
Still i weave into my song .
Or laid great bases for eternity ,
Consisted of -- we give the sex the pas --
Queen of a double empire still she stands ,
The little boy lost in the lonely fen ,
Their mirth and rapture to prolong .
Because each wound shall bring sad death ere long .
He can not stretch beyond the hundredth year .
O little lonely crosses that gentle hands have made ,
She shines on thieves on the garden wall ,
If by easy work you beat ,
But my plaintive strains should have told before ,
Another rock will yield you passage safe .
Her tears fell on it fast ;
Sad , as a wounded snake .
And when my heart hath found it so ,
To make her cornfields yield a double store ,
All it dreamed when it stood
Her fear suspended breath .
And day by day the fairest water brought .
When the blue dusk has filled the pane ,
Here , take my heart .
The simple fence its holiness doth keep .
Like these , drew down his cheeks continual tears .
Cherubic laughed , enticed , dispensed , absorbed ;
Nor when the autumn reads
So calm its pain thy bosom bore ,
He lived where dreams were sown .
Or found , in even the faults they blamed ,
Six melancholy months have slowly passed ,
Gives to the breeze her scented wing :
To riper boyhood grown ;
And the fog lay on the river ,
To rylstone he the tidings brought ;
Though not a beam the clouds remove .
But no power to seek or shun ,
And to see him tremble , and feel myself
Where maiden dreams adown the ways of sleep
All thy tricks are spent and past ,
When shadows creep ,
And am forlorn , finding in you the one
Wherefore was he sunk in sorrow .
A shoot of that old vine that made
Then irresistibly it lives , it works ;
Of disobedience ; firm they might have stood ,
With optic glass take nobler views of god
Which way these took they pointed , and i went
On thy eternal hills look forth ,
Creations of pure art that never dies .
The shades of night around them draw ,
As winter bends the sea-foreboding pine ,
These were the arts by which she captived
Like israel , led by cloud and fire .
A crystal fountain spread its streams around , }
Pity and help he still may claim . ”
May be the shadows flung by what we seem .
With tears attend thee as new bows 'd ,
And answered thus , to anger stirred :
On the foundation which is laid by nature ,
Thus judas lay in shadow and all was still ....
The vital motions blocked , -- until the stuff ,
Unto knowledge yields its place .
" thus my wretched doom has found me ,
That holds the sunshine in its azure bowl
Until they saw my spirit leave the earth .
Now preserve the law and order .
The shining silence of the scorn of god .
The years are coming and going ,
The rounded days and the safe years he sees ,
Are life 's threads all sorely tangled ?
Tower , to survey the triumphs that proceed .
From her full bosom told the rest . --
They 'll never let him coinless go .
While life remains to it prepared to outface
May set up any faculty they please .
On sunday morn , when a slant light was flung
Was the whirling guess i made , --
The road goes crawling up a long hillside ,
Herself laid as before
Your absent charms my thoughts employ :
Of some snow-crested mountain , shouting ranged
Might leave the frame immortal in its tomb ;
Cleft every arrow as it came .
Scarce one in all is found that hath made good
The palm and the may make country houses gay ,
With beating bosom , and with eager pace ,
A branch off , then rejoined the rest
With eyes that know and bear his fire ;
That spoke in this menacing tone :
Rising , where thought is now denied to rise ,
Gathering her brows like gathering storm ,
Of rest that rises as a tide of sleep ,
Bearing in his arms the winnings ,
Yonder stony tower -- its halls lay open !
Dost thou thy dogma still defend ?
That melts the fogs in limpid air ,
Making thy waves a blessing as they flow . _
Thus to his speech made fit reply :
Roaring from nether hell and filled with ice ,
The multitude 's grave shepherd , took full flight ,
He thus let loose his easy chat .
Then panic reigned , and many a mournful sound
The western republic no longer will stand
The startled steeds in wild confusion thrown .
Who shared the gifts of ceres at thy board ;
They watch the slowly sinking sun .
Old eyes bow down again ?
With him my life would flow ;
Which bore his spirit high above the waves ,
To read a hidden meaning in the stars .
Thy cares make light as foot of fawn ;
The sun hangs in the cobalt-blue sky ,
They did n't tell , nor make a fuss ,
Far voices of a joy that sought and missed her
So it stood there all alone ,
The shadows of evening had spread .
Went slipping down horrible precipices ,
A thought resigned with pain , when from the mast
The doubts that in his heart arose : and now
Did crafty horace his low numbers join ;
O pride , the hollow boast confess !
Because to you alone his smiles are given ;
Togedre come of on accord ,
So margaret 's heart a softer beauty wore ,
For the breath that goes as it comes ,
Through which to penetrate life 's mystery .
So sacred a contempt , that others show
May god send chastisement
Shall float the vesture of pure modesty ;
Kind nature the embryo blossom will save ;
Where stiff silk roses range their bloom .
Where he that fills an office , shall esteem
And rivers from their oozy beds arise . ]
Gray clouds hung round the west --
Of breathing flame , which lives to leap on earth
And little stars shot from their fixed places ,
Helen survives , with youth and beauty fled .
He turns away -- a silence falls -- the night
So go the town 's lives on the breeze ,
And when to whelm the disenchanted nation ,
Touched by love 's magnet , hither often drew ;
To mark how moments fly ;
Life may give for love to death
That light divinely keeps .
With that he let his gunshot go ;
That scene so bright so soon should pass
And yet shall lie . life mocks the idle hate
The latin squadrons take a sudden fright ,
Who fills the armies of the world with fear .
As the storm-winds ply the bellows .
One courteous parting sign she made ;
The vase must break that holds so many tears .
The composure of settled distress .
With every baby he shares his joys ,
To him who thus on scripture took his stand .
Not undevoid of beauty there they come ,
Water the grave where hope lies slain .
Never the battle raged hottest , but in it
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
Then the hearts failed and the tools fell ,
And a word that shall echo forevermore !
How did we dim that wistful dream ,
Took his soul , his ghost , his shadow ,
And she disposed herself , in treasons versed ,
And can quench a glowing furnace ,
To see god pouring light into his star ...
A spell has fallen -- a prophetic dream ;
As a wild wind their branches swept .
Which she reach ’d to theodore of stalach .
Till we have changed our birthright for a gourd
Shall strip a hundred hollows bare of spring ,
Beneath that grief too great to bear .
And scarce recovering words his plaint renew 'd .
Trees borrow tongues , waters in accents fall ,
And this same flower that smiles to-day ,
May hear despair , which truly saith
Has brought it to its closing hour .
While life her wasted hands is wringing ,
The common soul , unguarded , and grown strong .
Evil genius , thee i banish ,
A lightning sent from sinai and a gleam
Did heavier drops of blood stand on his face
And peace which far had learned to roam .
God then shall fill thine empty heart ;
Ring forth his curses , and the court cry out
Oh ! when it bursts its roseate cells ,
While an old woman made remarks to one
Which to their corses came again ,
More gently struck on hearts inured to grief .
Through leafless shrubs the cold wind hissed ;
For such dishonour shown to thee :
Lures and invites the kiss of wanton air .
With a race descended from mars ;
As perfume passes from a fading rose ;
" in thee resplendent is the godhead shown ;
Still follow sense , of every art the soul ,
Dante once prepared to paint an angel :
A vision brought to his entranced sight .
The smile of heaven lay ;
Hath builded a world that is gateless ,
Before him all thy sorrows bringing ;
That halted , just as the day was spent ,
With gaudy colors flecked ;
Which yet join not scent to hue ,
And ask , why nations come so far
Th ' escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks
The grace of a blue sky can never fail .
And bring such pleasures to an end . "
At once a lovely isle before me lay ,
Art not led to swamps and lowlands ,
We find a heart like thine ,
But , distribution made , thy lot exceeds
The madman 's cursed hands hold everything
Hers to bid life revive , " --
Seek thou the gold that gilds eternity .
Methinks the lark has made it still his care
Each hawthorn shed her showers of dew --
Rejoicing convey them where fame may be won ,
The waving kerchief from the cliff had spied ,
Bringing a pang of pained regret !
August brings the sheaves of corn ,
From him i turn to these more generous souls
The voices known as " beautiful " come near
And the night has come , and planets glinted ,
By love , to lay the sooty ghost .
Vines climb and swing in wildest grace ,
God 's mark is set on thee ,
With offerings fed the holy fire .
And how contending passions urge mankind :
And howling and yelling , to flight they took .
May come and thro ' those portals pass . "
To solace those who grieve one must have felt
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me ,
Just then the sunlight fell with sudden flame :
Grief dares to mingle her soul-piercing voice ,
And save the democratic reign .
The deadly battle pitched in line ,
Joy filled that maiden 's eyes --
See where the spectre goes ! with frenzied look
By cupid 's taper , it is shown .
And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood .
And in a coffer it he laid ;
Of that excess made to the face a nose ,
While its mighty circumference circled mankind .
Sweet is the lore which nature brings ;
Me now -- if her dreams had shown
Poor peter glowed with pleasure .
When his mother 's life departed ;
Deep in these yawning caves black shadows lie
Out ran the valiant warriors all :
Love 's a fire that needs renewal
Yet i cursed not , nor shed tears ;
With mournful looks the blissful scenes surveyed ,
As by the cottonwood it flowed .
Two eyes met his yet darker than that shade
Where the hay lies thick and greenest ,
So you see my life is twofold ,
And up the mountain side with light heart sprung ;
To thy father show my prayer
The snow lies light ,
Which down he cast before the cavern 's mouth ,
By just revenge the tuscans set on fire ,
No turmoil need bring :
Oho , i 'll follow thee until thou grant
And beauty 's magic made him look behind .
The shadow of the thicket lies ,
To win her grace whom all commend .
A flaming chariot sped , and came a cry :
With glistening letters wrought in red and blue .
The form that made her dreams so blest .
When thy merry step draws near .
They bring me sorrow touched with joy ,
For having lost but once your prime ,
Love can not live where leisure never is ;
I christened her persia , you see ;
Comes a passion and a cry ,
You something of her tale may trace .
And discord follow upon unison ,
And feeds with pity from a faultless hand
When leagued oppression poured to northern wars
Where freedom of the soul knows no alloy ,
For having lost but once your prime ,
Whose light through delicate lifted fingers shines so clear ?
It only shows the ancient proverb 's force ,
Ne’er could such crime from me proceed .
Knew not where to look for succor ,
Go your own ways . who shall persuade me now
They go by turns each one unto the judgment ;
Thy windy will to bear !
To the tender-ship , you see ; "
God for thy virtue lays a plot .
Never will they tread these uplands ,
Whose agitation told how terrible the trial .
Dreadful his fate , that strikes confusion 's blow ;
He wrought much good . true faith in liberty
That never gives -- tho ' humbly takes enough ;
And misery at once , took in her hand .
For impious pinnabel maintained the strife ,
Tyrants fall in every foe !
The crashing bones before its force gave way ;
Of the angel were colour which shines and sings .
In two short verses which the whole contain :
Strikes the half-century with a solemn chime ,
And so it came to pass that merlin sat
My soul took shape some song --
That follows me faithfully , steady , and true ;
Through all her frame the rapture ran ,
In trees that shook with elfin-hearted mirth .
Which the red sea 's extremest waters lave .
Nay , all that nature gave or fortune gives ,
Throughout the mighty deep , it said ,
And they must win their way through turbulence
Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping
And cursèd counsel came from her :
No farther eastward can ye stray .
As the bright sail with brightening wind was drawn ,
Where distance smooths the little hills .
That steal o'er it calm and sweet ,
Do you not mean to share these joys ?
The trance that held him , and awoke .
Like that swift followed by the thunder 's crash ,
Her senses failed , she sank upon the ground ,
On all the race that calls thee king .
Unmoved the embodied greeks their fury dare ,
As far as gloom went in that room ,
It woke and knew god 's all-embracing law
Diverse philosophies to tear the world .
The student came to his relief
And for firm friends your heart to greet .
Our love has grown with the flight of time ,
And with his mercy washed and made them fair .
' that day in paris when you stood revealed
Hath here found answer thus .
And let the guilty fiend go free ?
" beneath the daisies , there they lie ! "
And in the straw lay quiet ;
They quickly join 'd the fray , and loud arose
Of mail-sided monsters shattered asunder ...
Send up such touching strains
Shalt cast the morsel from thy lips
But strength divine will borrow --
That left it full of sylvan memories .
For the forest , the forest has conquered !
A murmur into her music broke :
The flower that makes the springtime
Ten , twenty , thirty , there they go .
As he pursues his lonely way
Shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise ,
Or the great sea when sleeps the wave ,
There misfortune still might find thee ,
We 've seen the seasons through ,
As the moments roll on .
The night wind hovers ' neath the pallid moon
They found that he had fought beneath their banner .
The more life 's path extends ,
Will it waken the loveliest music
How nature held high festival ,
From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat ,
They bound their belts to serve his need ;
And felt that all was well .
And all went merry as a marriage-bell :
With that he sighed and round the dungeon went
Great was the outcry that was made ,
Which makes our failures sometime seem more kind
The pirate ships came leaping , grim and black ,
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds ;
' o foolish creatures , lost in ignorance ! '
Of sin that keeps us from thy joys apart .
Of linked sweetness long drawn out
He said ; and doubtful stood deiphobus ,
To aim at highest honours , and surpass
Then turned his glances to the north .
My soul , filled full with a disdainful ire ,
So passed the ever-changing april days .
A breath the wind is bringing ,
That pleasure fills with tears and feeds from flowers ,
Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
And share the wrath you may not quell .
And it spoke the words which follow :
As barbarous folk expose their old to die .
That low in death the giants lie .
To purchase fame a golden guinea went ;
God cancels a marriage when love flies away .
Against these frenchmen hath their pardon bought :
There comes to me , questioning those cold stars ,
Which gets the idea . it is well to know
And at the lifting of a hand sprang forth ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Fire reaches us , since in the glimmering stars
Jealous of the applause they gave him ,
Of the last agony of nature wore ;
Through a world that is wrapped in mist .
And she again him cast a friendly eye
It will break in music , i know ,
First blew her away right out of the sky --
So that his knightly honour took no stain .
Which to express i can not language find ,
Shifting her side , short respite seeks from pain .
That lovely smile declares !
And the next gold day waned trembling and white
So when bold homer makes the gods engage ,
In memory it runs , a shining thread ,
Comes greater light , succeeded by the less .
Could be formed by federation ,
Who feels no pity for another 's woe ;
The lone watch i 'm keeping .
After the fight these sought our line ,
Other distress or grief to match with mine . "
With jealous care piled up her plate with lean ,
She gentler fortunes found ;
Their yearning bosoms glowed .
Such trembling joy the soul o'er-awes
Yet feel no heat but what our loves impart ,
Till , when the weary endless sands were passed ,
And choked with the rising sick sweetness
With a touch of speeding rainbows ,
We 've reached the harbor of shadowtown .
Memories shall mix and metaphors of me .
O nightingale , catch me his strain !
Where east and west are met , --
What held it though on one side was a tree
Has closed our warfare , let the conqueror march
Should not drive thee from my body ,
Could ought of song avail to ease thy pain ;
Are the sweet chords strained and jangled ?
The game we follow still .
If things ensued that wanted grace
More light than was before them . neither met
His mighty angels , gave them several charge ,
Life 's record rounded with the funeral stone :
My voice unworthy of the theme it tries , --
As in a prosperous state we see ,
We entertained a drift of leaves ,
White flowers fell as the night wind blew .
At length he breaks the ordered champions through ,
And the cold is crowned ;
And trace his lineage back to neptune 's birth .
When human ruin choked the streams ,
When autumn lay on vale and hill ,
Who real happiness pursue ,
Of far infinity that draws away
Won from good warriors , whose device they bear .
To sculpture turned by magic sound ,
Before the town the tuscan army lies ,
As the combs went in her hair .
To those bewitching beauties turn ;
And set thi love in sondri place ,
For it bears great blossoms of scarlet shame .
That made my inmost heart so glad ,
Summer is come , though winter months be here --
And the moonlight flowing over all .
This erring mortals levity may call ;
Much joy not only speaks small happiness ,
Speak aloud the words which follow :
Earth 's passion thus our being fills ;
To share his happy lot in heaven .
My story tells , by love they were
Long mysterious reaches fed with moonlight ,
Joying in woes which others felt .
Our greatest foe has been laid low ;
From the hand of hypocrisy and quenching the fire
I seem to see great sorrow brought about
That hath kept watch o'er man 's mortality ;
Would england know where strength is found .
Hither bring but truthful measures .
Nor even when stars would grant them sight ,
Of greater hope possesses , as is written
No more the trumpet calls to arms ,
Honor the ride they made !
The play is done -- the curtain drops ,
Here upon earth i make too long delay . "
Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies :
Four poets came who loved each other 's song ,
Where fortune doth me lead .
And find we served a selfish creed
The din the world at distance made ;
In cupid 's court went merrily ,
And draws me to those bushes mazy .
Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh ,
The rosy clouds float overhead ,
The day had passed as other days do pass ,
Where the compressed teeth fixed it to forced calm .
The glory that encompassed him .
That with musical mirth shall ring ;
You 'll see where mountain conies grapple
Plunged in his grief and heaving many a groan .
Floating on , the music leads me ,
Upon her head -- " this faith was shown
Hearing the music as they pass ,
Once more . exultingly her heart went forth ,
Has burst god 's peace , raging in storm .
Like power to reach to hell .
Their navy is ruined , their armies have run ;
Forth into the village went he ,
To draw from them the luscious sap ,
And wash the whole world clean as gold ;
Of pride unplumes the lofty crest ,
Of unprolific winter has impressed
Which the long evening shadow is stretching before ,
Of his free bounty , who had made them apt
Would his own lies betray without a bribe .
These bore their record ere they passed away
An angel in a dream brought cheer :
Where sympathy sits dimpling on us yet ,
And learn to temper their devotion
I see their planets turned ,
And gave short speech to mary sweet and wise ,
Than what she gave in buying what she sold :
While tears of distress fringed her delicate eye ,
Must a world its treasures give ;
Hard his breath came through his nostrils ,
An equal spaciousness of bondage find
Never could evil enter thither ,
Till sleep creeps nigh to ease their cares ,
How he flings and scatters out
Which ( every spar was gone ) descending glowed
The fields gleaned long ago :
Was touched with pity for him hanging there ,
That can for long keep footing under that
Those long inscriptions crowded on the tomb ;
Whilere companionship in war had made ,
Deep malice to conceal , couched with revenge :
As that which dares to teach that we are born
Which makes the aggravation greater .
Here i can find life ,
So on the gloom of life 's now faded scene
There are thickets hung with gloom ,
He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt ,
Something whose absence leaves a void --
The faith they owe ; when earnestly they seek
The dull air heaves with wings that glide before .
Virtue and pleasure both to dwell in one _ .
And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins
Again it was morning , but shrunk and cold ,
A little over us his station took .
Then ráma , with his spirit moved ,
He broke upon his foes ,
Though it have brought destruction on the world .
My gazing soul would dwell an hour ,
If words fail , song will come ;
And waits , in snug concealment laid ,
Which deal unto the humblest folk ,
And in those days she made a little song ,
The rest dismounted , makes his spirit quail .
But over each black hour has hung
Little brown baby of mine , go to sleep .
We bear the name that marks our race ;
And all on lausus ran his restless thought .
Follow each other with unwaning powers .
The promise which the hero gave .
Of blood it lies about his feet ) .
He fears the banks will hurt our trade ;
But music -- follow it simply as a clue ,
Cheap doctrines forced , wild uses taken ,
Enjoys his gains , and has enough to spare ;
A treadmill-life , contented , leading ,
How she fell a slave to the chieftain ,
By my unsparing wrath impelled .
Repentance often finds , too late ,
He sought the home of his old love ,
A brook goes babbling to the sea .
The wandering stars move through the air serene ,
Of the hostile sect resistance can be made .
When peaceful folk in beds lay snug asleep :
And him i saw bow down , because of death
And by the breath of mercy made to roll
The snow fell hissing in the brine ,
Thou with a smile didst take it in ,
Just now a wave of perfume floated up
Hath made even pity , pitiless in thee .
To my feelings came nigh ;
The goddess laid ; loud rang the wondrous work .
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
Thy blessings descended in sunshine and shower ,
With the green trees waving overhead
Last , he reached his arms to sleep ,
To show how lightly life may glide away ;
And the baron now gave orders
The god who guided he adored ,
Misery lurked within his eyes .
The fervid heats of summer noons depart ;
Like tender things that being caught feign death ,
" but spirits view the heart .
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose ,
The chancellor felt sorrow and woe .
That his desire the promise he had made .
Where dreaming ears the angel-song shall win .
See the army put to rout --
While shouting nations gaze .
And them like you that 's got it ought
Sigh for the change your haughty empire feels ,
A god once was made and heathen had prayed
Drawn from out their lore of age ?
Upright , whom in the gulf we cast ?
From where the holy shadow lay ,
And that remaining sage , to follow her .
Freedom lives , and right shall stand ;
Shalt thou give law to god , shalt thou dispute
With faculties still growing , feeling still
For him that into battle goes --
Through every rift it foamed in vain ,
Set forth , in words that drag ,
Drink life and fragrance as they flow .
For the dim air echoed with elfin calls ;
The future tenour will to thee unfold . "
But he was driven out by themistocles ,
Who faces issues ; he who never shirks ;
That onward came some space from whence i stood .
I felt in their presence the free winds blowing .
There lay the cold keys of the citadel .
Make service noble , and the earth redeem
" here shall the boundary line be laid . "
Till they reached a lonely wold ,
A wanderer glad , he has still found a home
His burning bosom buttoned it with stars .
And be applauded and make money --
Guided by faith and matchless fortitude ,
Where legacies have purchased tears :
And self-denial shall be hence maintained .
Such zeal as only saints can feel ;
Thy faith held light as foam ,
While silent detonations shook the air --
“ the ancient nurse a shivering tremor felt ,
So pilgrims , bound for mecca , pray 'd
And catch the sparks that flutter from the stars !
Where many a sacred tree was set .
Money he took , and let them smoothly off ,
That we look out beyond the brace of years ,
And with proud titles swell that story :
And love divine doth fill my heart .
I am lifted elate -- the skies expand ;
That i must carry , counting all for loss
Scarce had they closed this martial lay
What we have felt and seen we truly know ,
Wrathful , the king the scornful sentence heard ;
Of summer the swallows are bringing .
New charms she adds to every scene ,
And came back crowned with wealth and power .
And whose bless ’d oracles thy lips declare ;
She caught and kept his first vague flickering smile ,
The doves upon the roof made music too ,
And the sorcerer 's brought me sorrow .
He puts us in a cheerful mood ,
Where knights of spirit sway ,
Who saw two years of college -- earned herself
Past , and the sunshine came along with him .
That knowledge which best serves us here on earth ,
The jury meet amid a rapid shift
A man who for the truth withstood his wife --
Stands , a white lamb bearing the purple cross :
On him men call down evil from the gods
Many kemps have felt their power .
Although , his courtesy to show ,
Of conscience drove , and i betrayed
In such a palace poetry might place
And hasting there his homage paid .
From they golden dreams arise ;
And out beyond into the dream to come . '
But thy ships flying , with despair shall see ;
Each tint on the surface he spread ;
Pity 's flood there never rose ,
For nought but what thy happiness could spare .
Our church still shows the outward sign ,
If bold in virtue 's cause it spoke ,
That the lad 's fortunes would be soon retrieved ,
Mars doubts to whom to give the victory ;
Who makes the saviour all his theme ,
And ghastly faces thrust themselves between
First came thy passion 's flood and poured around her
Against god 's pleasure , than that fruit which makes
His face directed , and large passage made .
Thus in council sat the great gods ,
They stamp upon the brows of hate
This makes the dean for kindred thus provide .
And poets find their land of dreams
When some smart talker puts them to the test ,
The dying day sinks down in languishment .
Yet it 's the joy we scatter here
Of their invention ever wove and spun . --
His sabbath days met with observance due ,
Because my love is come to me .
And all the company made very glad ;
His egotism rose , fed by the hurt :
For they this kindness had not thought to share .
From the hard season gaining ? time will run
Flaming , flickering on the night
And the hearth-stones sing in pleasure .
Then shared the tyranny , then lent it aid ,
Let now the chimneys blaze ,
To make them heart again and courage take .
Where heaven shows pictures of some life spent well ;
When our two souls stand up erect and strong ,
Whose unimaginable sweetness thrilled
Forth came dread clouds as black as hell
That lets not god be manifest to you . "
His counsel could not share .
| this is the statement the company made :
With eyes that were not touched of tears
( good humor should prevail ! )
I pierce the gulf ; i sweep the coast
Give and pass on , and how the selfish live
Fond dreamer seeks his high ideal love ,
Could but palliate the anguish ,
And then he went his way ,
And ghastly mouth that gapes and groans .
We see when we remark in common phrase ,
Filled with passion that knows no slaking ,
Through green leaves lift their walls of grey ;
And keeps the fame our sons shall keep .
And join sweet prayer to grateful praise .
Is gone -- wherever it goes -- for good ,
She was alone . her throat began to swell
Scarce sees deliverance come . but when she saw
The prince perceived well , and long admired ;
Nor let the shackles make thee sad ;
And shame that skulks behind ;
To dip it in the very blood of christ ,
To seek his fate in london town .
Peers who their conscience to no market bring ;
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;
Then dragon-guidons led the march
For war like this to guard democracy ,
And smelt , they made peter 's mouth water ;
Thence it descends to the last potencies ,
It strikes the poison to the heart . "
And quickly find that woman-soul so strong .
Thus runs the tale : -- yon blushing maid ,
Each sentence hangs perfectly poised to a letter ;
Her laughter stung as a whip might sting ;
And in thy hands that life to lay .
Never can the hero give it ,
All thy thread of life is spun ,
All other feebler feelings overpowered ,
And guilt stood face to face !
While the colors turn . but oh ,
Of eve , whose eye darted contagious fire .
'till in its might the heavens themselves could read
And do what things the rules consider wise ,
The autumn pines and fades
Kind chance shall bring us luck at last ? _
The dim white ship like a white bird lay ;
As they retain vitality . "
When love would make two hearts tingle ,
Its pathway , which the wisest fail to spell ;
" can you with heavenly forms engage ,
His warriors arm , and take their forceful darts ;
Now is the time that face should form another ;
White flashes dance along the deep ,
The burial office read ,
And all that with him doth remain .
Spread full the canvas to the rising gale .
When hail and fire above it ran .
He had pursued so fair a fame alone ,
At the three kittens cast a careless eye ;
With all the rest to bed to speed .
( i thought i should come to grief ) ;
Deep silence where the shadows cease .
Whose branches cast a tender gloom ,
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven .
Through all the world its might extends :
Lady , their blushes shine
The folk together , that the priest might set
" ' the robbers is ' t we see ?
Is like a dragon , laying waste the land
Observe , six thousand heroes stand
Feels not the wants that pinch the poor ,
With sightless holes gazing on blinder heaven ,
Her life she rated , while it lent a spell
And each good subject lies dissolved in tears !
Had made the birds begin by tymous hours ;
Thus quietly thy summer goes ,
Of what was hovering over camelot .
The brazen weapon driving through his back .
And on them spread her beauty shining bright ;
Till their young hearts with ecstacy were fired ;
Like hissing spears the fishes ' fire streamed ,
Heroic , for a hero lies beneath ,
She hears the tide go out towards the moonlight .
Again attract ; arts against arms appeal .
Armoured archangels that trample the void :
Because his own bright form had made me swoon
That crowns my master dead . well i recall
Which told me she was there alone ,
And sporting with thee there long time i passed ,
Yet mine eyes the watch do keep ,
_ a multitude of citizens gathered therein . disturbance shown
And sturdy men rise to possess the land ;
That see so little pleasure , so much woe ,
And the spell brings the dear olden time
The only art her guilt to cover ,
The common griefs to make him weep .
Just laws redeemed not from the appointed doom .
Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal 'd .
From wrong and ill the being that i gave ,
It lay within a glass of green ,
Of steps had worn a way . not verdant there
Who , moving others , are themselves as stone ,
Mistake you would have made on seeing the two ,
Their brave hearts come from mountain and from plain ,
Pass as a stream that ran .
May he send your soul to eternal perdition ,
Turnd to exploding hiss , triumph to shame
Or in the full creation leave a void ,
Where willows shake their watery-sounding leaves .
Who wrought the great work of his age ,
Whose sighs do freeze , and tears drop hail ,
Will not reach the silence of my kitchen :
The heavens that murmur , the sounds that shine ,
That speechless eyes went seeking in the night ;
Once more death bends the fatal bow , --
And a foul pestilence creeps down from high
That shines upon your fame .
That giveth me the captain of the church
And sobbed as if her heart would break .
Years have sped ;
Another sight had seen that morn ,
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought ,
They curl on high , then breaking on the land
The lessons love can read me . " yet again
Of virtue to make wise : what hinders then
As the steamer wears to sea
Which runs across some vast distracting orb
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;
Antilochus -- what more can i relate ?
And the charger flies on his course .
His counsel take , who gives the best advice ;
That evening passed with music , chat and song :
You fill with such a serious grace ,
Now front to front the hostile armies stand ,
Of whom the fame is hidden in the past .
My " mallet " served to knock me down ,
Which falls with ceaseless murmur from the mountain .
Not merely lost in wonder , but astoud .
From her pretty shoes arose it ,
And half have lost their youth ,
Had shattered all love 's triumph -- life had passed
Claytonia 's rosy bells unfold ;
' t is sweet to know that stocks will stand
Enormous marching , to and fro he swung
First poured its ecstasy ;
" empty words will break no portals ,
To take the direction in things of this life ,
While circling time moves round in an eternal sphere
A light wind stirred the garden : everywhere
Too beautiful to bear .
Till it reaches the midnight 's gate .
Every glance that warms the soul ,
Not ardent lover robbed of all his bliss ,
Wiping the tears from sorrow 's clouded eyes ,
The cheers break out from the waving crowd :
The cause of peace ? -- for answer , slip
Or happier thoughted when the day is spent
The face of his crocodile majesty saw .
When it tells to the waiting crocus
This doth invite me , this assurance give me
But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking .
And all , as in days long vanish 'd ,
In spring earth swells and claims the fruitful seed .
With the good monarch went :
That flashed and sang and was not vivian ,
The sculptor to make beauty by .
Whereto the boldest thought may reach
When names acquired baptismally
The wary wombat goes --
Followed : the king replied not : cyril said :
And peals of devilish laughter shook the cave .
Who , moving others , are themselves as stone ,
For ages on the nourishment the orchard hath prepared :
Of what thou dost misfortunes call .
And so he bore the imperial name .
Sidelong odors , that give life
And make a silence like to death .
Now magic runes she adds , more potent far .
And silverly the river runs ,
In haste the hose they lay ;
He spoke , and fell in sorrow drowned
What gifts i have shall thus be shown :
To bear high fortune , or endure the low !
Old christmas is come for to keep open house ,
And left me mourning in a dreary jail .
We shall thus be made aware
To pass my holiday .
To place his confidence in me alone .
That fires the length of ophiucus huge
I to the muses have been bound
For the living tomb gives up its dead ,
The dust sets her sneezing and coughing ,
Long lashes hid her eyes of blue ,
The birds their notes renew , and bleating herds
Form , and colour , nature drew .
" great mars , give me heart of grace
Surged by the flood of grief and shame that rolled
Or power of kindness went about him ;
And breathe a song into thy heart
Titanic laughter as its way it went .
Hope to be unexpectedly made glad
Hast joined the good and brave ;
The boldest pattern art can frame ;
Where is the gloom that its glory wore ?
More wisdom than near tongues can make ;
When the snow has gone that drifted them under ,
For nowadays it stands one well instead .
Then went her sunshine way : --
Cheeks whose dimples tempt to love ,
He has reached his second childhood
And took his journey to the north .
The fatal iron found and reach 'd him there ;
No load of sorrow but his touch can move ,
With threatening words of wrath that scorch like flame !
She battled onward , nor complain ’d
In the cause of his country to join .
The tithes they have advanced so high ,
And while on single pivot foot it set ,
" the time shall come that sailors shall disdain
And languid forms rise up , and pulses bound
And it 's bound for dreamland bay .
Of the smile that lit the skies ;
And our hearts yearn so with tenderness
And fills my bosom with delight .
Yet friendship forms the bliss above ,
Till other 's tongue reveal them . fervent love
And into his soul the vision flew .
Naught comes unlooked for , unforeseen by them .
Glad letters came from helen ; happy things ,
Or by the silence hanging sad
For all that now come or hereafter may .
And evening hush , broken by homing wings ;
The piercing cold , but feels it unimpaired ;
And drank the morning air .
In a manner that constant improvement is found ,
Now our bosoms feel that pleasure ,
I could not bear a doubtful woe ,
With red mouths lifting in the air ,
Hath faded into nothingness , and made
Through which gold sun-bits soak .
The green has come to the leafless tree ,
And sentence give ith ' chayr of wit .
And in the midst a silent tarn there lay ,
Thy sweetness scatters sweetness everywhere ,
Ere shame had forced a fast retreat ,
As to the north i took my way ,
Foreboding shipwreck , came the message plain :
But all about it flies a honeysuckle .
Was lost to heaven when this sweet woman fell !
" whence came that blood upon your hand
That led to where she waited you .
I know not in whose hands are laid ,
But who are we to make complaint
But lays " by the most celebrated pens , "
For the wanderer devious roads to tread .
The general , who a kindly heart possessed ,
The buds reveal their hidden glory .
And brothers ' weapons deal a mutual death .
Earth would have been too much , i see ,
Remembering days forgotten , moods exhausted ,
Till my last hope and last comfort is gone .
We went whither my soul was drawn ;
Who sought the thing he loved . for nature then
And what our ears with sweetest sounds may fill ;
My throbbing heart , and tremors shake my limbs .
All things have come since then to me ,
Of the happy days that followed ,
Grasses grow and waters run --
The flowers will feel the soft stars weep ,
Still lure her nomad odors from the musk ,
Time has watched them pause and pass
Around his form these arms will throw
She gave him an infinite faith in god ;
The scribe no question makes of verse or prose ,
That from the towns was come of palestine
And in what sports such pleasant time he spent .
Fettered to life forever , horribly ;
And then as last an echo flew ,
Left thoughts in the soul that can never depart ;
The dim watchfires stood like a burning wall
The funeral drops they duly shed ,
That nymph so smart should go about ,
North , take advice ; thy lucky genius show ,
A vision brought to his entranced sight .
Then he spoke the words which follow :
Which heaven to gaudy day denies .
The sculptor to make beauty by .
Dark curls with blooms that nodding caught
Grant us thy truth to make us free ,
A spy of all that passes in the fleet ?
One world i found , where souls abide
That roamed the forest shook with fear ,
And every grecian fix his brazen shield ,
That it receives whatever turns to it .
The empress refuses to join on our side ,
Ruby tears there came ;
Brings in the vengeance due unto those climes .
Whose breath has lent your earth-born flowers
There gently lay the roots , and there
To dreams that rock to sleep ,
Saw the pale shadow steal along the light .
Whose wine had turned to roses in her hands .
Then quick the answer came ,
Sweet mornings ere the apple buds were blown .
A country schoolhouse came in sight ;
May it know how the mind in expansion revolts
Links of a sweetness lost in air ,
But that dim land that lies between
Which she , whose fury naught can bear ,
Bestowed to make life 's pathway blest .
The wind with gentle touch unravels them
In pity lost , by doubtings tossed ,
My perspective still as they pass ;
Yet all but these she counted loss .
What sense the printed words may bear .
Each godlike guess beheld the truth it sought ;
With his warm blood in torrents shed . ”
She can not rid me of my pain .
While this weak cottage all thy splendor takes :
That helps to make the publisher rich
The selfsame kiss will go ;
Here to keep the saviour 's birth .
There make new blood flow abundant ;
O give me grace to follow
From out its orient tabernacle drawn ,
Thorough the fog it came ;
Then high sugríva ’s spirit rose ,
Could never make a memory so fine as
On every side the fiery lightnings fly ,
What hour he passed or what he bore away .
Incense of aloe filled the air ,
To make confession , take communion . she
Than the sweet summer zephyr which breathes over slaves !
Towards us came the being beautiful
Thy pencil dashing its excess of shades ,
A black and barren mountain set aloof
That mercy i to others show ,
And filled with blood and savage ire .
Be wronged by him who gave consent
Would quench the only lights that guide ;
Wouldst thou find refreshment , traveller weary ,
The wind blew from the mountain-peak ,
There 's a path that leads to nowhere
What is the message come to thee ,
That gentle faith which comes through grief alone ;
I mark the systems vanish one by one ;
It stood as in a candlestick a candle ;
The lake still lists the breezes vow ,
Are but truths that set
Are worse to bear , --
The love i bear to him .
Apart removed from mortals heeding ? ”
Then with a voice which fury made more strong ,
Down which the sun dives to embrace the earth :
Rayed out through their eyes with a sudden glare
The flower that once has blown for ever dies .
Where the pilgrim of nature lay stretched in decay ,
Desire its aim has only shifted , --
Of all the souls that stand create
That aught between them could ever die .
This racks the joints , this fires the veins ,
Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend ;
And for the stormy clouds which drove
And age , stealing on , assails thee ,
The moon came on , came leaning low
A great moon flooded all the west .
By buried centuries of pomp and power !
Wheeled on his middle course , he took his way
Till at his second bidding darkness fled ,
For idle hands in sport to tear ?
Measures my loss by all that i have kept .
Starts to fell the stately aspen ,
Through that strange illness that had fixed him there ,
No tears in torrents broke .
Where the lord high swank still held command ,
Which now abated ; for the clouds were fled ,
They run before the wind through high seas breaking ;
So fair she shone upon his raptured view ,
With flying fingers touch 'd the lyre :
And sought the deep . slumber at once and night
While tossing scorn abroad from righteous rage ,
My wayward life shall bend to love divine ;
It gazed to the top of the wall so high
Shade of my sorrow never fall on you .
And harmless on the earth it lay ,
And soft lights streamed upon her ;
Seem given by the rule of contraries .
God of our fathers ! make it true .
Their eyes at the same moment fell
A strange voice rang and calmed to him :
Bringing earthly ills to end ; --
She opened to life 's cloudless air ,
Of wind and beating snow , or renovated
A chearful welcome these bright creatures sing ;
While love 's luxurious pulse beat high ,
And give her blooming health and spritely force ,
With aching hearts and with diminish 'd crews .
Any great glory in the shape it wore .
So fell the capitol of heathen rome ,
To ruin sunk the church and tower ,
With tears the flame of anger glowed .
Though fast it follows rushing on .
Straightway sings the songs that follow .
And when a fair wind rose again , there seemed
The grace that changes hearts of stone
I remember holding a serious conversation with an enlightened
Now twilight veil ’d the glaring face of day ,
God , perhaps , sends summer showers ,
Joy , joy alone the throbbing whitethroats bring ,
From the lost one , and it said :
Thou shalt the crown of martyrs gain !
The place he found beyond expression bright ,
Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send ;
And nine fat goats each vessel bears away :
I find the magazines pay quite as well .
Teach ignorance to see , or grief to smile ;
The lilacs where the robin built ,
A wain bound east met the hearse bound west ,
Led by the faithful beacon of love 's eyes ,
Staked on a kingly cast , had met defeat .
' twould give our resolutions wing ,
How hot the quivering landscape glowed !
Of spongy texture , yielding to the foot --
Or rhythms holding as with sleep or trance
That which still makes her mirth to flow ,
What following sorrow may on this arise ;
Or view the couch where sickness lies ,
Take back the hours of passion given !
And ask my business there .
Grieved for the morrow . sadness fell upon us ,
And god the waters gives ;
A columned ruin heaps its sculptured marble
How the plot turned about i watched in vain ,
Some friendly smile it still might dare to claim
The midnight phantoms feel the spell ,
Low stooping from the cloudy gray ,
The royal seat they made me fill .
Nor leave that path which leads to thee ,
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
At night , was it considered . but thus
That filled their shadowy yesterdays . . . .
In my heart the joy stirs ;
A ready banquet on the turf is laid ,
Of his free bounty , who had made them apt
( the second sight , ye ken , is given
Into the rock there runs a grotto wide .
Hath power , directed thus , to bend elsewhere ;
Small thought had he to mark the strife --
Once and again and again descended the murderous blow .
And , born to lift our souls to heaven ,
I felt the fast years slip and reel
To lose me , his betrothed , a mighty cross
Tossed sleepless -- every aching sense astrain
With honey and with oil feeding the flames
With folded arms , nine days was borne along .
Or shines it not as innocent ,
The rudest breasts the strong persuasion felt ,
Just before death had wield the fatal blow ,
And fosters every growth of happy life ;
Before your numbers eminently stand ;
Each soft indulgence nature fram 'd to share ;
And the long purple berries that rained on the ground
This interview to jacob peace did bring .
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
To urge his fury fixt , with furious horn
' mid twilight thrushes that rejoice
The whistling winds already waked the sky ;
I view the youth , and feel compassion rise .
Shall i make inventory of thy grace ,
Puts every fire of freedom out --
And some for the prophet 's paradise to come ;
He tackled the job like a spartan .
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave .
What happy man to equal glories bring ?
And brought before the empress , who had made
Sighed the rose as it stood by my side .
Which made that past time sweet ,
Light bring no blindness ,
Of fatherland is given ; from deadly deeps
And out of heaven came a burning breath ,
And carried northward , bound , a score .
Answered in the words which follow :
With the last kiss 's bitterness , still tremble .
My love comes back to me !
I 'll meet the raging of the skies ,
Three cheers our gallant seamen gave ,
The years may darken as they flee ,
The bookworm will devour the very core .
When my soul sees all things gray ,
Blue mountains hemmed it round ; and airy sighs
Is drawing to a close . about him stand
Lives in our hearts which can feel . "
Come cling within thy mother 's close embrace . unharmed
The friar possessed not a grain of romance .
He ceased : thick clouds of dust rose high
The river ran unruffled under the shady bank .
His bitter speech he thus pursued :
The war still rages and the battle burns ;
Which kept him free from many doubts and fears ;
Like lovers they melted and tingled ,
Making a will and giving it due form . "
Of sunset , among plains which roll their streams
Till ruin i bring on the traitor king
At last there came a sudden pause
In sympathy with souls by sorrow bound .
Down the zodiac urge the race ,
Which hope would deaden and destroy ,
" o take the sacrament , my child ,
That madest me follow glory 's theme ;
Just tip the solar-system downside up ,
That makes grim charon thus to pity thee .
On every mummied face there glows a smile .
Impetuous , from conflicting vapours sprung ,
The noise of bells went sweeping by ;
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied ?
For while the tired waves , vainly breaking ,
' open the door , some pity to show !
" through florence led my journey home ,
Red sands roll leagues on leagues
And from each scene the noblest truths inspire .
The dreams within my bosom grew ;
And makes a whirlwind of the universe .
Which , brought together , would find loving voice ;
Not torn with pain of any lurid hue ,
Forgiveness only told .
To you for new light now is turning .
That tries to race , i still insist
The wind sighed low like a sick man dying ,
The golden harp gives out a jangled strain ,
From the path that god has given ! ' "
And law reveals where all seemed useless strife --
Of glory , nothing less than man can share .
And winter fought her battle strife and won .
And for that strange mishap shed many a tear ;
And made an end of mystery . he had brought
Soon as my soul had outwardly returned
When looking back to youth ,
Thy feet the road goes stretching far away .
That power alone supreme -- that left them free .
All the transporting music of the red ,
" the fairy rade " came glimmering on ;
He makes speech in guiltless ignorance ,
We turn to catch one fading ray
That was wont to share his glee ;
With rage the ancient willow shakes in every limb ,
To bind up words of strife begun
That kindles them within makes them look red ,
But through the thick trees wandered far and wide
So moved the host of troy , rank after rank
And soon is lost all trace of mud ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
For thou art nearer to him , and take heed
She , from the rending earth and bursting skies ,
Enkindled all : it trembles into heat
In youre dom i put it al .
Of those high words of truth which search and burn
When he felt the stitches go ;
Deep in whose waters lay the sky ,
You taught the prayer that helps men to unite ,
Had found in nature 's self a tongue ,
Happy , did sorrow seize on such alone !
Which held so long that ancient pair in peace .
Apart they went from this world of sin ,
That i the tenour of my creed unfold ;
And relieve him from his misery ! ”
Part of the bottom forth , and went his way
His anxious heart asserts the truth i sing ,
In flood of thought sees its reflection
With an eye that takes the breath :
My breath came short , and scarce at all .
Had suddenly gone from us ; that some face
As light winds wandering through groves of bloom
Fill each heart with joy !
Never transfused and lost in what she loved ,
His standard gone , his garments red ;
Down sank the brazen fabric at his feet .
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair ,
His eyes turned to the distance dim ;
Marking my grief , broke off the intended measure ,
Free may thy soul be set ,
The heart he bore to the holy land .
The faint gold curls arise
To keep this unexpected holiday ;
Through the haggard vistas crept
Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets .
The work will call for patience , too ;
And the frame he turned to heaven ,
The fact of guilt that would remain .
As was even now by reason rightly seen :
And we turn from the harshness of swords ,
Where it lay in place of rafael 's glory ,
On the rough edge of battle ere it joined ,
Shall deal , and doom me to eternity . "
To shine the wonder of an hour .
" descending hence unto the lowest powers ,
He may be found your age to bless .
Its rosy surfeit , find ye ease .
Such grace no living man hath seen .
" our bleak hills shall bud and blow ,
As twilight elfins make , when they at eve
But those , whose vigilance no care escapes ,
Takes the balm of magic virtues ,
A chance but chance may lead where i may meet
Where it has lain in sleep , my arms about
A hero that the shocks of chance might strike ,
Roses gave the myrtle light ,
Change the meaning i conveyed ;
Perchance to show his lore designed ;
He heard the cymbals clash amid the crowd
" we 'll see what we can do . "
Her awful voice detain 'd the headlong tide :
As swans might draw by chains of roses
And lamentations pierce the bowing skies !
So eagerly they cling in venus ' bonds ,
But six are down to make the cocked hat --
Still humming on , their drowsy course they keep ,
In symphonies the spirits weave
I curl more music round the air ,
The elder of the brothers gave a squeal ,
" my clay with long oblivion is gone dry :
Imperfect , ere its organs gave it birth .
His reasons for rocking the lullaby word .
And i have spent three days upon this rock
And april showers descend ;
Two gates that guard it well .
Of all the kneeling throng , and piercing higher
And laws for little folks are made ;
Of fumes , arising from a boiling breast .
To hide the blushes on my cheek that burned ,
Late , from this western shore , that morning chased
A journey to the town was made .
Her halo was poised . but in the stead
Marks coming and marks going ...
You watch it cloud , then settle amber clear ;
The many blessings to my life allowed ;
That not much blessing came with them .
Bloomed up into this world of pain ,
The world went round about ,
Scatter them flung throughout the ages all ,
From every gash his body showed
The unfeeling one bores holes in your head .
And thought an earthquake lit ;
Blest and thinking bliss would stay ?
The different doom our fates assign :
The soul of brotherhood whence reverence drew .
The matter may betray their art :
And he spake the words that follow :
No power can check , no might can tame
And down the gothic nave the crowd flows by
Her eyelids fell down and she seemed to sleep ,
No haven here has nature placed ;
But turn a wit , and scribble verses too ;
Peace , peace alone can join us once again ,
The deep air listened round her as she rode ,
The tidings of his glory reach her ear ,
The exhausted clouds laden with crimson light
That fell from that cloud like snow ,
Defence he knew was none to make .
Where the big hearth sings ,
Where tortured silences creep .
That gives us victory .
The gods lie cold where the leaves are gold ,
The light is ebbing in the dusky sky ,
Most perfectly they made agree ;
Fresh october brings the pheasant ;
Where the gates swing open , wide ;
Each striveth for appearance , and doth make
As it passed , murmuring :
And had raised the sun for shining . "
Give thee more gifts before the end shall come
And this effect two different fountains wrought ,
But the blunt aspect spoke more sternly still
The thirst of hearts like this heart can assuage .
Oh come , sweet boy !
All love itself -- all love around it seeing ;
The wind draw out of the west and wail ,
The very darkness cast a shade .
The confidence of reason give ;
Too much _ wealth _ like weight oppresses ;
The sunset fills the wide sky with its splendor ,
In solemn state they swept the glowing strand ,
Then came on him a sort of sacred fear ,
But sweeter the death that joined those twain .
For whom sad sion 's softest sorrow flows ,
We ’d meet , and quickly rise the keg ,
If to fruition my bright vision grew .
As the gay bevy lightly tripp 'd along .
Unto the next laurer i see ,
And to friends far and near my greeting bring .
( as mortals count pleasure who rush through their day
The sound takes a deep , insisting tone ,
With thy celestial song . up led by thee
The memory of another summer rushes ,
That drenched the world in melody .
Open now thy store of wisdom . "
And yet , how they pinion our passport
Kisses the blushing leaf , and stirs up life
Where lies the sun on books and piles
Mists we on mornings see
And cling to hope and keep the right ,
Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went ;
The blood ran down for days ,
Of god , that iron scythe forged by his thunder
Expects me there when spring its bloom has given ;
Flowers expand their light and soul-like wings ,
How aphrodite to thy hurt is sworn ?
Scarce now the flying shores of italy we gain .
It tells of him who for our sake
The end of the unruly wealth that grew .
And thus apart our hearts keep time
And whines when he takes no heed .
That happy time all past and gone ,
But when they found their efforts all in vain ,
Diviner virtues -- charged with powers to heal ,
On the sombre rafters , that round him made
My emily jane has lost her arms ,
Words that came from distant ages ,
And all her visage troubled with deep dismay .
The which do endlesse matrimony make ;
For the ice of the north is broken ,
Rules o'er a cheek which seems to show
A truth recorded by a generous foe ,
And perils which might still surround him :
The sieve would show ,
Slipped softly thro ' the roaring gloom and glare ,
Though hunger 's hand lay cold .
Shall find surcease but at thy fingertips .
With gloomy aspect rose the ling ' ring dawn ,
As the heart waited for wherein i wrote them .
And in this love his chastisement was found --
Things proving him devout more than the nations are .
Nor a hero needs to span them . "
Thou wouldst only raise a scandal . "
That rippled their golden banners
I can hear their voices calling ,
The thought of marriage -- poison which remains .
As down the vale thy lonely footsteps stray ,
The greenest mosses cling .
With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief :
Spring has a rushing sound , and summer sends
If childhood , age could shape .
Its explanation found !
The air grew pinched and wan ,
If winning it shall leave a stain .
And floats the music borne from seraph-strings .
Close to our hearts one little word we lay :
Among a heathen clan ye 're placed ,
Up to the moon is cast --
O science reaching backward through the distance ,
So brown went home and nursed his sorrow ,
And that can not stop their tears .
Sounding fresh keys to bear
Which arise on the glass of the sage ,
When study serves but to heap clue on clue
And there he set himself to play upon her
Solid and stirring in flesh and bone , --
While winter put on his most terrible frown .
He heard , was prisoner made or slain outright .
Since appetite by this was turned to evil . "
God filled the earth with beauty ;
And in thy joyous errand reach the spot
All woe begone shivered the ladye flower ,
Go easy , do n't act like a fool !
In my most secret spirit grew
The east put out a single flag ,
Each breadth of life to meet ;
It could not make thee bald a single hair .
Exchange of powers of this conflict came ;
Blue clouds of incense dimmed the vaulted height ;
The eye spoke kindly when the lip was closed .
Grieving that he such sacrifice should make ,
And all his prospects flee .
Shaped into fragile boats that swim his waves .
For men i have trod the sorrowful road ,
Assail it , but those talons hold in dread ,
Thick leaves close clung to slip ;
In hopes that it might tend to make amends
Calmly beneath her earnest face it lies ,
To slumber unconscious my wearied eyes passed in ;
All things making for death 's taking !
Thou hast upon my sorrow poured thy balm !
As in his arms his living love he pressed .
Here grows lavender , here breathes england .
It is a sunshine mixed with rain ,
To fight false prophet of soudan .
My full-flush heart streams come and go
Which may round off an hour upon a time .
January brings the snow ,
Together they followed the cattle home .
When on you dawned the first equality ,
For riches that serve for nothing
And make the triumph of thy quest complete .
Now swept the land , now sought the sky ,
But from my branching arms this infant bear ,
My heart shrunk back and dared not hope that she
Great babylon her haughtie walls will praise ,
It moved so sweetly to the west .
With garish memories of kins strewn round ;
Pressing hands and whispering passion ,
Then a strife arose about a trifle , --
Then shall a sunrise follow , mild and fair .
And , hearing it said that he was dead ,
While he softened o'er his outlined angel ,
And the same love that first descended there ,
Some island which the wild waves beat --
The fame of my name shall go ringing about
Each tuft of green they whelm from sight ;
Here too thy banners move abroad :
Through the weeds its way it made ,
They fleck earth to oblivion 's brink ,
Which made the muses in him rejoice ,
Upon the roses it would feed ,
Encombred of his lustes blinde
Thy weak wings folded and thy music hushed .
Far more light the lamp that bideth steady
May fight for heaven where heaven would not prevail ,
Ever raised money by way of annuity ;
Throbbing with thirst the creature lay ,
To lead the blind world to the light ,
And bid your steed go faster ;
Over the face of the leader came ;
Nor sturdy oaks embrace the mountain 's brow .
Made room for that fair stranger , as he strode
Than the gift that meant the wasted worthless
“ but how may lengthened life be spent
Whether the blaze allured , or hunger stung ,
The grief was bad enough to bear ,
Where truth and beauty grow .
This one thing i certainly collected :
The dauntless heart that fear 'd no human pride ;
Of charity , that makes us wish alone
Will rest be met with only !
Of coming springs fall on the quiet grave .
And hour by hour , in peril , passed
Glorious , from earth to heaven , so to express
It sweeps the land with icy breath ,
Sleep will come when thou art fled ;
Thy blood set boiling and thy brain askew ;
Their voices make me feel so solitary . "
But feelings i need not control
So , of his pounds he gave but fifty .
I have abandoned all control , all thought
Into stone had changed their waters .
Chasing the gaudy butterflies that lure
Cutler saw tenants break , and houses fall ,
Thee , odin 's raven guided to our hands ;
We should keep our eyes on the heavenly hills
Who counted their seasons when insects were winging ,
Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne ,
Thy scholar in the war ! therein stand ranked
That seems to feel itself from home ,
How thoughts within the mind can grow .
By the light sitting on their brows ,
Resolved to take advice of an old woman ;
To make your merry blood run slow !
The wide earth gives , gives golden grain ,
Which best beloved hands have poured ;
Yet nought but single darkness do i find .
What sounds are these that gather from he shores ?
Which neither feels nor fears .
In doing what we most in suffering feel ?
And give his readers quantum suff. ,
Thus the nightingales made speedy answer :
Means that life 's best comes ever breasting
Our onward steps but back the landmarks bring ,
To take a mighty dukedom far away
But now the vast years intervene ,
For the night has come and it brings to naught
And then he heard the hisses change to cheers ,
From off the altar ; and the flame that crowned
Where billowy ocean rose and swelled ,
The sad angry sea is fallen asleep ,
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow ,
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
" if mortal schemes may foil the threatening hour ,
Ere they reached a place of safety .
And the musk of the roses blown .
Which his awe-struck eyes had witnessed
Could work such device -- to her ruin
And to athens deliverance gave .
The gallant frith the eye might note ,
Those that felt the wand of muse --
And wandering winds of heaven .
Were with long slaughter lately waxed sore ,
Of reformation , ere the year run out ,
Whelming its melody into a swoon ,
And when that solemn hour shall come ,
Is drawing to the grave .
My soul is sailing through the sea ,
Did sympathy get for brave captain sword .
One fortune loved not and looked at askance .
Golden fruits their charms display .
Day by day to widen our demesne .
Trap ! trap ! went the gray ;
With flowers and sunshine of spring 's sure returning ;
Hast thou a star to guide thy path ,
Thy placid eyes give wounds more deep and sore .
And face the tasks which every morning brings ,
Piercing the eyes , shrinking the throat ,
Dispelled by thee the doom that spread
And he spoke the words which follow :
Thickening with storm , the wintry clouds will loom ,
Are these that make the sable crew ;
All day and night to high olympus soars ,
And the sky shows that very ancient gray ,
A finch , whose tongue knew no control ,
The verdant soil the red blood runs in streams .
That love should call thro ' joy and pain
In form so tangible , harrows the eye .
A moment white -- then melt forever ;
" hath tracked the fortunes of the brave --
To much remark and wonder led .
Whence tyber first unlocks his mighty flood . "
As to suffice in rendering grace for grace ;
Thick plumage mingled with a sanguine shower .
His patients heav ' nward to convey ;
With joy of life i draped each spacious room ,
Cast cloud-grey shadows there
And that awful form i meet ,
Far must thy researches go .
The air grows chill , the mists descend !
Among the arabian thieves thy face go hide ,
And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
No more , with ages past inurned .
But it rolls through the heart of the may .
Duration gives importance ; swells the price
But he that feels the sorest fits ,
Placed by death , with life those corpses fills --
Thither a stranger roved , my mother bore .
Contending leaders at the word arose ;
As to render further cheerlessness intolerable now ,
So , when death brings its shadows ,
To italy came charles , and for amends
And found those men desirous of all gain .
When coupled with good looks and brave attire .
It fills the crevices and deeps of soul !
For magic framed the wondrous vault .
How the boat drew homeward filled with flowers !
The first i gave to allan poe ,
His empty chain above it leant ,
Where thought must follow the fashion of thought ,
Loud wails the wind and beats the driving rain ,
You must forsake your christendom and faith ,
Oliver feels death 's anguish on him now ;
A bond in solemn honour bound
Let her eyebrows sweetly rise
To bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss .
One by one thy griefs shall meet thee ;
Trembles , when any spirit feels itself
The farmer forth the three pounds fetched .
That prize the greeks by common suffrage gave :
The frost the tender blossom kills ,
The robes of ages that had passed away ,
Begotten of his breathing , that can raise
Soar across the somber horizon .
A new day shines on wrinkles and white hair ,
Of land makes life , but sweet content .
The weary head fell low : --
Sounded aloud . the peal it blew had made
' there came a sound of weeping
Spirits , who came loud wailing , hurried on
Here , where the climates meet
I make this prayer sincere .
And how to make money with inches on tapes .
Her lips this double woe declare ,
And from his lips escaped a groan ,
A vision came unto a saint of old
Love will add gladness to the scene ,
And thus the conquering chief addressed :
The basest weed outbraves his dignity :
" take courage , bird ;
Heavy with death unto the ground , yet made
And added lands increase the lusian reign .
You should not find a line drawn wrong ,
The trumpeter bravely has blown his way
Since first he felt in the miraculous dark
I yearned to cast my life away ,
When the frost has made them sweet ! "
And in thy countenance shine all the features
Only the scattered crimson of the rose ,
Renews the grateful song .
The bitter dregs that tell of wasted wine .
When earthly cares are laid asleep !
Eternal beauty has its fruit to bear ;
As when a rainbow in perfumes goes out .
On arthur 's ear a voice comes murmuring , --
And death had been -- but douglas rose ,
That sometime grew within this learned man .
Where that same treacherous wax began to run ,
Hearing thy songs so sweetly , deftly wrought ,
Give me your constant outlook to the sky ,
In trial tones as he pursued his way :
Like a cloud of morn they bore ,
How our lords make strife ?
And with such pain his eyes did swim
Through all times that are gone and each tongue ?
Shaken trees their riches pour ,
Stories that sent me hot and cold ;
His love of duty yielded constant joy ;
And bear her song to the distant closes ,
From where the village lay .
When his half million went .
Shall not this weary warfare pass away ?
Where titan rises , where night hides the stars ,
And the shrill trumpets mix their silver sound ;
Autumn wind rises : white clouds fly .
No blink of blue that a cloud lets through
Lake minnetonka 's purest waters lay .
Would pass and catch the gleaming of my hair ,
Of autumn follows large and recent yields .
The shadow of death o'er my spirit lay ,
Breath which holds the spice o ' youth ,
Contagions spread their wings of pall ,
Because to fate the might of zeus must bow ;
And languid forms rise up , and pulses bound
I see no limit in my fears --
That gazed back at me so gay and glorified ,
No tree could ever bear them twice .
Barkings her jaws produce . the place remains
While they that , since their kindred was displayed ,
Butterfly wings came drifting , dreaming ,
To the musician : " calm your grief ,
And lift us to the height of grief again .
His dream-body soared aloft through space .
My whole heart rises up to bless
But they made ready for the race ;
He instantly recalled the name ,
I felt that i should live ; nor could despair
Their contracts made , they feel themselves at rest ;
With which all virtue buried seems to be !
Nor grief can visit her sad heart again .
Although it be loaded with grieving ,
I followed a distant singing ,
In honest works to lead the van ,
Of harmony , in tones and numbers hit
Shall take body bye and bye ,
And followed still , striving with the divine
Shall i who had not virtue to stand straight
The leucadian cliff we follow ,
More loveliness than she conceals .
And back through air his treasure brought ,
Like ocean battling with the shore ,
Sixty years since i took the crease !
The smile , that rests to play
With joyance bring her and with jollity .
And every song made her fair praise ascend .
Who whip the mob to fury , bellies fat ,
O could i feel her faith again !
And how his madness went away ,
My eyes are wet with the tears i shed ;
" and since round lines are drawn
Tyrants shall never tread us down again ,
This one i take which holds within its own
See , sweetheart , how the lilies lay
Is but illusion built up as
And gives good proof of his fidelity ,
The stars hang their lamps in the sky ,
The grass springs up again ,
That wealth , which nature prodigally gave ,
And gawain went , and breaking into song
The wind that blew from cassiopeia cast
With warmth gives sentence , yet is always just :
That linger yet in dust from whence they sprung ,
Turned his glances to the north-west ,
“ enough for me my inbred wisdom serves .
Your champion in so fierce a strife to make ;
The hand that grasp 'd the victor steel ?
There they hold their union-meeting .
The startled river turns leaden and harsh .
The door that admits good news and bad news ,
Bjorn , harbouring a gloomy whim ,
And when mild evening comes in mantle gray ,
When punch gives friend and foe their due ,
The wind in fear forbears to blow ;
Their dangers hid , and dangers still increased .
He ceased : the tyrant ’s eyeballs blazed
Their flaming fronts , and give the opening blaze ;
Truly is nothing which outside may bound .
But leave the sultry passion-flowers
Which hadde a love at his menage ,
Night after night the grey rains swept the sea :
Save failure only , seized me . evil finds
Like thunder , fell upon the ground .
To minos down he bore me , and the judge
Her bland lips shed a lively smile that sent
The sinner groaning under loads of guilt ,
While many remarked , as his manners they saw ,
And sad are the tidings they bring .
The hearts that gaily beat in pleasure ,
He sits apart , an exile , and his brow
Their prayers perform ’d the chiefs the rite pursue ,
There yet were hope the church could pass
_ evil spirit _ . wrath smites thee !
Not weighing but obeying all command ,
" from me this friendly warning take " --
Incense , to sweeten a crime ,
Drink life and fragrance as they flow .
Thy sable form comes treading lightly
" the rivers rush into the sea ,
And peace and joy it brings my fair .
And my shame-faced donald poked me .
The haschish of the west , which makes
Night is come ; no moon , no stars ,
His spirit flew through fields above ,
To make the flame go higher .
So precept and example tend to show .
Will never find a lack of folks to buy !
Before him , to bear witness and to say ,
He knew the course the vessels took .
The hand we gave the weary and the weak ,
The battle rages , we must share the strife ;
Was not confined to feeling for her friend ,
Consumed her beauty like a flame ,
Was to draw images from everything ;
That memory keeps , of all thy kindness there ,
Calypso , glorious goddess , sought her home .
Edwin , of melody aye held in thrall ,
Where the roads run ,
For jove in all that breathes must dwell ,
That sic a couple fate allows ye ,
Yet can but make their sign into the air ;
All tend to perfect happiness , and urge
The prison where our hearts lay bound ;
And kept his course with head held high ,
There came the joy that maketh us afraid .
As christian faith permits , and asia 's war .
And all the army hither lead . ”
Who leaves a brother to avenge his fate . "
" i count him lighter than a flee . "
As made the governor hold his breath ;
Doomed to be conquered , stayed the fatal hour ,
Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the
“ with thee to stand as guardian nigh ,
As the heart prompted , the concurring hand
And every time that love has made me weep
Around a slaughter 'd army lay ,
And soothly it is passing chaste .
How have the raptur 'd moments flown !
Salted with fire they seem , to show
Beat always ; and what way the music bade ,
Since last i saw those sweet eyes shine ;
Nor build i this new crown
He craftily went on ;
That nature puts to work the acting frame ,
A germ had slipped its shell , and now
Of him who sought the good of all ,
" the gross is given , by inscrutable god ,
But sweeter , goldening the sphere ,
And with their lutes sweet music made ,
And a truth that shall make men free .
Such countless terrors lie in wait !
Of squadrons burning for the fight
Hearts , that never heaved a sigh --
Of pride and passion ; and there came to me
You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much !
And little birds break out in rippling song !
Grim vengeance yet shall whet a sword
This poor song that sings of thee ,
And in words like these expressed him :
On floating rails that face the softening noons
Your ship should run against the rocky coast .
She burnt all over , restless with desire :
On moory mountains catch the gale ;
Which heaven gave him to inherit ,
Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains .
For with sudden terror her pulses beat ,
The waves received the rain : the lightning flash
And varying passions stir the murmurous groups ;
And the smile of the face is reflecting
That tears have graced the greeting of my heart ;
That peace is come -- and all is well !
It sets the blossoms flickering white .
Their anger speaks accumulated wrong .
A cloud * presented to my view ,
A nymph , who lightly tripp 'd it by ,
Chased to their last hold by triumphant foes ,
Where is laid the lord arisen ?
Go take a trip . for neither man nor woman
Take deep to thy proud prosperous heart .
Like a rocking canoe cradled by soft wind ,
The genius of the river seem 'd to rise ;
The ways walked by the poet 's feet .
As the tide comes tumbling in .
Till god , to him the secret doth explain .
With such importance gave commands ,
And in his veins clear spirit ran instead ,
For this she gave her ample dower ,
Achilles thus his speech to priam turn 'd .
From simple acorns take their humble rise .
Take a warning , happy lover ,
The dramatist resumed his pen .
Quickly the stream asunder bore the pair .
And the dance went " merry ! merry ! "
Can such ill grace to high estate belong ?
He makes who doth address himself to speak .
Then the lord himself gave welcome ,
Had met wi ' sum romantic opposition !
To give his aid , with ignominious stripes
Ne'er fails to make his yearly rounds .
His jointed arms , to fix a deadly wound .
I feel this place was made for her ;
As north from south -- the impulse felt before ,
That saw from his prison arisen his stars .
As one may shape his future life .
It came like hope across the mind ,
More faith in what it means ;
For it left her lonely-hearted --
And take the welcome that true hearts provide . "
His laugh was something to make you glad ,
Go straight , and what they tell you mark .
Cutler saw tenants break , and houses fall ,
Their thankless hearts can never reach .
Of death laid thus on thy melodious lip !
Calling to mind remote and small successions
That the fight to end had come ;
With thy celestial song . up led by thee
That lighten 'd on bandello 's laughing tale ,
Than idle jest , than passing word ,
Her graces fire me ; from the bloom that spreads
Ravenna hath maintain 'd this many a year ,
At first her eye with slow dilation rolled
That were cold and extinguished in sadness ;
And heaven it self doth thy dark wards obey .
Thy life is in the life it gilds ,
Mine own the words and mine the melody
The parapets whistled , the angles glistened ,
Pope is commonly considered to have laid down the general
And wish to spend a day in bliss serene .
Though miles on miles of space between them lie ,
And made a settlement , was rich in fact ,
So souls shine at the eyes , and pearls display
So wrapped she is in new unbroken bliss :
If in our hearts this love beats strong ,
When his trinacrian shores the navy left )
Where woods bewitched and fairy forests stand ,
Like flowers selected from the rest , and bound
The wealth its arching branches hold ,
Thy trailing fragrance heavy on the breath ;
Took shame or fear to counsellor ,
No rainbow so makes one the sun and shower .
Because thy rights are shared with one !
Of all the centuries yet to come ,
But now i feel i hunger ; which declares
To keep me happy all the day .
Lured by the songs of birds and bees ,
Unto whom the three worlds call ;
Vice , in whose dungeon virtue lies in chains ;
The moaning wind went wandering round
Through centuries extended .
The leaves first fledged have lost as yet
' o gentle wind , that bloweth south ,
Again , if bounds have not been set against
" to lose the brightness of the shining sun ;
That hath wrought this piteous woe :
In agamemnon 's thought might none compare .
Look thou my steps pursue : the margins give
For there shall come a mightier blast ,
The maladies that hurt the soul .
Not to lose pity pitiless became .
Not all the sea his fire can quench .
Summer woods about them blowing ,
But should some victim feel the fatal fang
Come dreamy forms and faces ,
On the dead fiends her glances fell :
The howling felon swung from side to side .
The winds of the west have whipped and shrunk ;
And eyeless nature that makes you drink
Swam the big moon , veined with light ;
To whom creating nature gave
Comes the foreboding sorrow of this cry --
With a wild strength which nothing can repress !
Guiltless of testicles , they tear their throats ,
I only see the years . they come and go
A woman 's voice , that through the twilight came
Beware the rising weather !
And winds go fanning up and down
Upon the enchanted dome lay such a spell ,
And see if you find not the christian creed
What dost thou cover ?
That are sung his fame to raise .
From menelaus ’ arm the weapon sent ,
But apollo 's hand waved warning :
Far-called our navies melt away --
When dusk shrunk cold , and light trod shy ,
And her foul soul to blackest hell descends ;
His shade returns again , that was departed . "
All eyes are strained to catch the joyful sight ,
And find thee still true-hearted ;
And lost the child-like love that worshipped
The last breath lingering on his lips
And the earth shall show his face .
Children , whose golden locks yet shone with the lingering
Of ghastly spasm , or racking torture , qualms
I pointed , where your vessel came to shore ,
And hapless innocence is left
_ youthful voices passing . _
Cast away our cynic shields ,
So white and fixed and cool it stands --
That followed on the fatal night ,
To plan new laws to arm the regal power ;
Take the laughter first of all .
There shall the new world look for thought
And , her panic to dispel ,
And avarice , lent their spurs to industry ;
Where'er the cross is borne with smiles ,
Feels darkness fall upon her trembling light ,
Who basely breaks the promise made
Dream-food ca n't possibly make you sick .
About him closed the utter desolation ,
Where galileo stood at nights to take
And guard the freedom of the immortal press !
Laws silent for a space , and forums closed
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake :
We can not lead the lives we would ,
He flitted to and fro a dancing light ,
Answered in the words which follow :
To merge himself in immortality ;
To me he made reply :
And sorrow moved him to partake
Anguish came upon the swallower ,
But only served to hinder and to tire ;
Love that had turned to bitter , biting scorn ,
" has kept its little watch of light .
But answer there came none --
That the north may see the sunshine ,
Which added doubly to my former fear .
Ravenna hath maintain 'd this many a year ,
What follows more she murders with a kiss .
And makes the philadelphian port assign 'd ,
Sheer curiosity their footsteps winging ;
When trystin-time draws near again ;
My heart is sad , my senses stray ;
Shall human strife celestial minds divide ?
Than to a king , which hath to lede
Like sweet thoughts that shine through dreams
That the cold wind makes in rivers .
And lay down in her loveliness .
A lady with a lamp i see
While ye chase beauty over land and sea ?
The gentle , laughing , spring had come
The heavens themselves have cast an angry look ,
Which every boon on prayer bestows :
For brightness covered him with glittering .
The cradle rocked and made its moan ,
And evening o’er the land was spread .
How deep the sorrow that finds no tear ,
Or he must go to dust without his fame ,
But makes his moral being his prime care ;
But when divinity comes cross me
And death is felt no more . "
Angry then grew wainamoinen ,
The weary yeare his race now having run ,
As gentle expletives which might give relief :
As a pattern can stand before us .
't was na the wildfire 's flame that played
Then addressed the words that follow :
And once the soul has known its dream ,
When women play upon their womanhood ,
A glorious promise is to christians given ;
Quelled anarchy within him , come to law ,
The slaves whose rights they buried .
The cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape
Though the wind hath fallen , they drift along ,
Till time shall work me a cure ,
For me the fairies hung on bush and tree
For mysteries that urge , the blood of them
Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry ;
And the moon said to the sun :
Yet through his veins a chill of terror ran .
The whole suggested yellow , white
The altars had bright cloths and cups to hold
The inches of the theatre went for gold .
" by the name our fathers gave her ,
Her little world , with pride , affection sees .
Heaven wraps in wreathes of blue ,
Such as would make one happy in the fire :
There came a day - at summer 's full -
There set his throne and ruled that kingdom wide ,
The forest , letting in the sun , and made
Yet , though to thy breast fled , my soul
Drawing near the easter sunday
And exult with hearts set free ,
Has passed between them and the glorious sun ,
Could artful numbers move thee ,
And take delight in what her hands had wrought .
So dear a life your arms enfold
Were poised and balanced , nor the war had given
The cry of a gull sent seaward
With senses quite absorbed in thought ,
Forth from the mountain cavern came
Of all the plagues a lover bears ,
Suffering , stretched beside the way
So oft repeated strokes are given ,
What greater bliss attends their close of life ?
For all your echoes caught the mournful theme .
The north wind came up ,
Confessed the fraud which brought him to his death .
As the thick noise that breaks mid weeping were ;
And though olympus all his thunders hurled ,
Mingle their melody ; the living spark
Such tears as often ran not
The soft south whither thine heart is set ?
Your lightest touch went thrilling ; and began
But when it comes to suffering mortal pangs ,
And from the pangs and sighs of ages risen ,
Embrace and draw , quietly , but so surely
She lets a furtive tear steal gently thence ,
But what his nature and his state can bear .
Once when the forge of battle sang
Melting they fall , and sink into the heart !
Nor are his blessings to his banks confined ,
His fearful pass your way pursue :
And virtue crowns them with immortal wreathes .
A mother whom no cry can melt ;
That friendship of our fathers thee shall screen ;
Then the winds arose in fury ,
't is not enough to keep a gig .
Though they that went as one by night and day
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
And wolves with loving lyonesses meet .
In order to behold your punishments . "
The warm blood coursing true .
A debt they ne'er can pay :
O not for them the tears we shed ,
" and -- gave the old concierge a penny .
Of the pain gone waste and the labor lost !
Life tests a plough in meadows made of stones ,
Her too young lover sees her growing old .
Live and take comfort . thou hast left behind
From east to west went pouring .
To meet the fingers that form the lace .
And misery makes the moments , as they fly ,
The wilderness called with her silent lure :
How to make one 's self a peer .
And turned her eyes unto the rippling seine
Firm as the firmest , where duty led ,
Ev 'n as the sprinkled blood called on
When the bright curtain of the day is rolled .
That brings to care release ,
As by the sweet italian voice is given
Arose before him . paths which led
Of love that goes and stays ,
His garment swept the ground ; his left hand held
Till to man 's scheming heart it came
The merry violin stirred .
The bulbul gave his truth .
They rise superior to the rustic tone .
And the sea where it goes .
And arts still followed where her eagles flew ,
Nought my life can satisfy ,
Come and turn away this evil ,
To touch a hand that clasped a cross --
His native wrath revived with this new thought ,
Would see and learn the rights of men ;
Open throws the wide-winged door ;
Where the castle is darkly frowning ;
Ashore by storms , thy castle stands ,
Then up she took her little crook ,
Spoke the very words which follow :
And undone orphans wash with tears my threshold ,
The pleasant river gushes
Ay , ay , the common sense can show ,
Hence , the small good which yet we find ,
Through israel 's warrior king . the strains that burst
Whose virtuous life has won renown ,
Were cut into slices heroic .
On its border shone the moonlight ,
And wove it with his fate ;
To see laughter rise from tears ,
From house to house the fire in fury poured ;
His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely ,
Of love , which fell in mi thoght ,
The valiant heart of noble knight takes keep : "
The good stars met in your horoscope ,
They reached as reaching heaven through .
And then , that we have followed them
The silent prayers your heart has said ?
Instant , the vizir 's council sat --
To warm the frozen swamp as best it could
Tossing , swirling , swept by the wind ,
The vision came and went ,
And even there short season doth remain :
Through which we sail , and feel when past .
Unrolling waves steal softly to the shore ,
Of song that up from dreamland come .
With that prohibition loaded cane --
And every flower that sad embroidery wears :
The forest ’s troubled ways to tread .
And passed this heritage to me .
Backed by the outer darkness , showed
Songs flow as water from my burning brain .
This fell invader of the peaceful plain .
Who feels what rapture thrills her ,
This windy tempest , till it blow up rain ,
Your fate is sealed forever .
Of love that still eluded me , was bored
Her ardent love conspicuously shown
That here upon thy path has risen ;
And plant a fairer image where it stood
Or have given way to slow mutation ,
Whatever lights or shades are on it thrown ?
A chamber hung with black and heaped with flowers ,
That showed again how much of him was dead ,
While from a tree that casts a pleasing shadow ,
Whence all his high spirits and hot courage came .
Lightning appeareth if the road it cross ;
For couples crowned with flowers that burn in dew .
You shine a star above this stormy night
Then with great joy will come again ,
The riches in the hilt that lie , --
The very air hung white with heat ,
Leaving on troubled hearts some lingering tone
The sunset glow hath kissed your heights ,
When the night tempests rise .
By all its power to make him smart ;
" see that the messenger takes some refreshment .
The message of his lord he gave :
" shine forth a constellation , full and bright ,
He shook and swore , for the moonlight shows
The sapling draws its sustenance , and thrives ;
Who enters here shall feel his soul denied
Of sorrow falls upon the sunny fount ,
( the pilot made reply )
On me let the scorn be thrown .
Clouds of incense weave around
Foaming and boiling furious , on it sweeps
Spill all the spice they hold .
A king might wish to hold in fee .
And the river made answer , soft and low --
And the red rose would but blow more red ,
That hue which hell had covered up in me .
Anon the chime of the church clock , which tells
I only gave a hand-wave in farewell ,
Their hearts to meet the unknown danger strung ,
And passing strange though the thing may be ,
But what makes that great goodness start
Soon as the fatal news by fame was blown ,
Now set thy long-experienced wit to school .
Will you take the praise in tears or laughter ?
Which makes each closely folded thing
Gave up the wealth that summers bring ,
In the soothing thoughts that spring
The breath of winter comes from far away ,
Lifts his _ malignant eyes , wasted with care ,
The blissful moments i shared with you --
The tide , that came regardless to his feet ,
From the tablet of memory efface me ,
I proffer thee my service and my faith .
Mr. penny , whose father was rolling in wealth ,
His mighty arms and held them fast .
Where answer to the innocent is made .
In weavings wrought of noon and night ;
Summer has come , healthy and free ,
( his patience was rewarded , so to speak )
-- thus we our hero 's picture drew
If fuller knowledge might be found .
To labour calls us , now with sweat imposed ,
Your fountains take and sweet bird calls
His glance too fell on a gold-wove banner
With fate itself so long to hold the course ?
Makes every living thing rejoice .
This week his mimic tongue runs o'er
For lo , the funds went sudden crashing down ,
She bade him break the slender thread ,
Along the ground they took a winding course .
And raised aloud their cry of dread .
She shot , out of her pride ,
Now came still evening on , and twilight gray
All occupied with elenor murray 's death
Her hair stood up ; convulsive rage possess 'd
To bring the truant 's lip more nigh .
And colour things to come with hues of night ;
A pillar with the weight it bore .
And he turned from me in hot anger .
Up with the sun , the breeze arose ,
He ceased . groans only issued from the tower .
But serves for her familiar wear ;
The heart of the night is pierced !
Take better counsel with thy heart , and show
Quick from the lips it made so odious .
Where all the banners of her soul were flown ,
It soothes and rests my fevered spirit --
The scent of flowers floated on the breeze ,
Just where the fir-trees make it dark ;
For arrogance noted ; to his memory
Her step that made the flowers up-press .
The year has seen , the year has seen ;
Till calm and holiness would o'er me steal ?
Of tiny rivulets hurrying from the snows ,
It lifts the boughs , whose shadows deep
" behold , to dis this offering i bear ,
Their history the wisest can not tell .
That felt thee kneeling -- touched thy prostrate brow :
He filled me with his soaring ;
When out of pain came peaceful rest ,
Such want of thought your folly shows ,
A little snake put forth its head .
When , bellowing * , they discharge their thunder :
Peace like a wave descends , is spread ,
He saw a book that on a table lay ,
There 's one odd volume left , to be
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze !
We are building the future with our dead ,
Till spring 's first flowers come .
A peacock 's feather met my sight :
Swift instinct leaps ; slow reason feebly climbs .
No less a storm the trojan hero bears ;
In melody soft to the world as it dreams !
That emperour has bid them sound trumpets ;
His pity gave ere charity began .
Till the lonely night has fallen ,
I cast the blood my pain had spent .
He carries weight ! he rides a race !
And from their sides the foam descends in snow ;
Days and months sped on unheeded ,
May he fall in with beasts that scatter fire ,
The path of heaven their blazing courses ran .
Upon the wall in colors blazed ;
And owned that nine such poets made a tate .
It welcomed the sunlight , and loved the snow ,
The living fires come flashing from her eyes ,
Some tints of transient beauty may disclose ;
Hate can not harm
Love and brotherhood shall kindle
Over the terrace flows the thronged cafe ;
An eager appetite , raised by the smell
Age following age still farther from the shore ,
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
In hopes to get salvation ;
" make this answer to the question :
And god who gives beginning gives the end .
But kept the reputation of virginity .
A feud too old to settle or renounce .
So quietness would come over her , with smiles
Soft went the music the soft air along ,
Her godlike head crowned with spiritual fire ,
The shade within the arbour made a port
Who then shall prop your sinking heart ?
One good thing youth has given and borne away ;
And grasses nodded and rushes swung --
And spoke in songs that brought you bliss :
How i should express my sorrow .
And weakness turns to might ,
The muse would pay the tribute of a tear .
Tyrants fall in every foe !
Soon shalt reach those halls of rest ,
Come little babe , come silly soul ,
The dancing waters danced by dancing daffodils .
Liberal she gave ; nor only thro ' thy strain
And think they made a great mistake ,
Like a transmitted malady you trace ;
And affinity hath won !
From where himálaya ’s heights arise
We soon shall reach a safe retreat , removed
Sought him and found him , working bitter sorrow ;
Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes , that stood
A gleamy splendor flash 'd along the fields .
Eyes that shine with a glow enchanted ,
With shady mountains spread their isles around .
" has left us little else but victory :
Love made him room and space to worship her
Perpetually , to find its senses strained
To court her , see what suitors come !
Of emerald hill and flashing brook ,
That seared his coward heart for many a day ,
Th ' eternal providence , i well discern :
With ineffectual ardour sought to rise .
That battle 's honour , wends the paladin .
A loveliness not born of art ,
And made them laugh again .
According to the virtue it conceives ,
Authoritative of that elder , sprang
The city won for allah from the giaour
By them the seeds of war are sown ,
Transfigures the summer rain . " _
Weather and rain have undone it again ,
On love 's strong throne its monarch sits .
Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right ,
The days swept on . her perfect year
There addison first tun 'd his polish 'd lay ;
And the smoke in streaks ascended ,
That not alone they shall not feel fatigue ,
Other forms have come between ;
Do n't keep your heart from him ,
Shall not my songs assuage her at the heart ?
When these eyes , long dimmed with weeping ,
But sad the thoughts he brings to me .
But that which from these accents flows .
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss ;
Good arguments he sees he might have used .
The lowliest duties on herself did lay .
And cruel slaughter made
Gathering her brows like gathering storm ,
Till death should call from his midnight sea .
Sweet honey from the boulder leaps :
Or , that oaths made in reverential fear
The storm came on before its time :
And the sad moon walks the sky ,
But he , whose books bedeck our shelves ,
Who built on faith as her corner stone ;
How sad the bird would feel . "
I have found once again the lore i had lost
For in pure love heaven did prepare
Pure hands bring hither without stain . _ "
That nature forms a rustic taste so nice .
While discord and disunion rend the land !
Doth nourish him , and airy sweets that come
God 's son , descending from his throne !
To sorrow abandond , but worse felt within ,
They came where the bears ' house stood .
We felt the minutes crawl :
Astride him : then a mighty shout went up .
They spent their all repairing baseball fences danny broke .
Subtly her hand struck the pure silver note ,
We builded against our fear
The king of ocean to the fight descends ,
Skirting the trunks of mighty trees , stealing beneath whispering
Death 's dark shadow seems to lengthen .
As fate commanded . now scarce seven remain ,
The painful sighs , which shook his savage breast .
Through childhood , youth , our solemn steps we bend
Macarean isse , felt his amorous guile ,
Thine earth now springs , mine fadeth ;
Soothed by slumber 's languor ,
And shaken with fever , and all burned out ,
The populace and makes them into laws ,
In delay there lies no plenty :
Perhaps more fair than the long light that flows
Who feared not god , nor yet regarded truth :
Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads
While the storms of life are raging ,
But soon the short lived vanity is lost .
With what intent hast thou this holy temple reared ?
Her eyelids fell again at that sweet sight ,
An easy thing to stand aloof from pain
Thro ' syrian plains curtained with curling mist
Body perfection brought ,
And seem 'd to strive his history to hide ,
Of hem that stood in great prosperity ,
Blood still hath led to deeds of blood ,
Till all resolved in anguish -- died away
As his eyes dying gave him mental sight .
I know i can reach the hilltops high .
Where mental wealth the poor in thought may find ,
Leaned fainting weary and so resting stood .
't is only wine can strike a spark !
How through the square he made his way
Now melting , mournful , lose themselves in tears .
And behind nine locks secured it .
Remotely , plays on the misdeeming sense ,
Before us , yet another wall arose ,
That wondrous bow received of magic might ,
Marbles would bounce on mr. jones ' bald head --
Where low soft branches swept my face , --
Till the long misery had to end or kill :
While they who seek in empty forms for bliss ,
The melancholy queen he found ,
That brooks in meadows run ;
The wife of my owen her heart may discover !
Whose soul is still prepared for death ,
When poppied cornfields simmer in the heat
To meet the bounding roe ,
Which claims no less the fearful than the brave ,
He with great travelers took delight to roam
That the dew of your word kept growing ,
That gave visions joined with anguish
The skies are smiling , and the forests rise
He 'd die to shield my life from harm .
Upon my praises following , of the eighth
With piteous voice , by woe subdued ,
With new sensations his old memory fills ,
With the peace he gives his own ! "
From which no care can save ,
I would have followed thee , but evil talk
Here spacious hold and lonely forest lay ,
Fair king of names , and come :
Yet have i drawn a lesson from the spot ,
With all inflictions ? but his patience won .
Unfailing proofs of victory to come .
To such a pitcher her smothered anguish grows ,
Let my lips sing for thee ,
Virtue alone can form that happiness .
As story tells , have trod this wilderness :
So sweetly rang the song ,
For war upon those many must he make .
And the horse made rapid progress ,
Ground by machines that give the senate ease .
" another year has gone for ever . "
From the wars my father brought it ,
That gave visions joined with anguish
My summer would last all the year .
Making the foul seem fair ,
( citizens , i give you friendly warning ) .
That blew delirious over waves and trees ;
Which thus to eve his welcome words renewed .
But he who settles in a fairy 's court ,
Which ran for miles , than gold more bright ;
Who make their peace with the king of kings ?
His time observed ; for closed by foes around ,
Shaking the tune from his wings
" ring out old shapes of foul disease ;
So is her little struggle fought and done ;
To the first flakes of silver that now fall
That by fortune is driven ,
And in evander 's palace sought repose .
For soon we reach the pleasant place
Love that endures , from life that disappears !
Your father wants you , run to him .
Such glory gives me as to gain the ships ,
Verses to build meet for thy rule of life ,
And while she feels the heavens lie bare ,
The sea that laughed with foam , and danced
Will pour her heart , when all is lone ;
The phantom armies marching go !
But things removed that hidden in thee lie .
Downward they move , a melancholy band ,
Why is thy sight still riveted down there
So those same walks the wind sowed lilies in
Meek loveliness is round thee spread ,
And let the sun shine on him as it did
To lower sails and gather in the lines ;
And souls went palely up the sky ,
Then his nose it went and bled ,
" it takes the women for to put us wise
That hath kept watch o'er man 's mortality ;
Fighting his country 's cause , the hero fell .
So here they fall to strife ;
The feast is kindled , and the goblet flows ;
When sunset brought an end of fast ,
The eve was still , the day began to close
And adores what to virtue has tended --
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt ,
Victory waited on the arms of spain ,
Beautiful thoughts that burn below .
That 's all . my luck was turning too ;
“ misfortune ’s come too hard to bear ,
Which breaks the lingering echo of the tone
These mortals that make blasphemies
Catch war and vengeance from the glance ;
Fear not ; unaltered doth my will remain .
Oberto takes to wife olympia fair ,
And made for her both wise and simple weep ,
Now to her task the milkmaid goes .
The weary task is put away ,
My soul would one day go and seek
Fond gratitude her share imparts
Across the meadows laced with threaded dew ,
Old aladine came fiercely to their aid :
Existence on that knowledge hung .
But see how oft ambitious aims are crossed ,
With insatiable eyes that kindle
Let thine answer be as follows :
Of madness will not find its way .
That runs so straight and white between --
And circling round the two their hymn began .
The weak , spent voice of winter dies away .
But came in such a season ,
That she should quench her thought , nor worship less
She who flashes while she feels ?
And the youth shed tears .
How glory sat on bondage for its throne ;
And gives the battle to his hands .
Nay , love ; recall those lately vanished eves ,
And then find fault with his appetite !
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears .
And the foam rushed up in a wild smother ,
He sets the birds to singing ,
The echoing thunder that rolled o'er all .
When hopes which filled its heaven droop and die ,
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
That our bark will reach west point ere long ,
Earth 's lyric comes on .
A lovely crimson dahlia reared her head ,
And leave no gifts but bitterness behind .
That made the breeze to blow .
Of every malice that wins hate in heaven ,
To make the field of battle shine with fires ,
And misery on my brothers drew :
The peasant 's winter evening fills ,
Upon my praises following , of the eighth
And the winds that blow through the starry ways ,
A taste of rest that comes with endless sleep ;
And heart though pierced with his cruel blade ,
The night is made for tenderness -- so still
And slander itself must allow him good nature :
Homes where sad young faces wear
Or that i wish you should your armies raise
Not one of these shall lead to liberty .
The virtues grow on immortality ;
But patience oftener sits palely there .
The wind sings .
Pierced through the budding boughs o'erhead ,
When spring puts forth her promise , offer up ;
Save to wait for the sign to come :
Success in equal balance hovering hangs .
Ye led my dearest friends astray , --
Shall meet that look of mercy from on high ,
To that strange land that hangs between two goals ,
And the gray river swept so near ,
Their hearts are worn and wasted with small cares ,
But see ! the angry victor hath recalled
Of borrow ( unless foresight cheat me here )
The mighty realm to rule and guard
Knowledge of good , bought dear by knowing ill .
Lo , there come echoes , faint diversity
Clamorous , and with furious heat pursued ,
That made his eyelids as a woman 's be ,
And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set ;
No vine of love her bosom gave ,
To the horrible fanged snarl , and the soul sinks
And ill could be pronounced to stand or flow ,
" your riddle is hard to read . "
On ocean ’s shore your feet will stand .
Win thy forgiveness also , and restore
Glory to heaven on high , it said ,
Or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend ?
Drawing his gun , he shot away the light ,
Some christian bade this great offence commit .
Assisted by fancy i see your sad plight ,
As froth of the swallowing seas ,
Could we stand with that old moses
Drags the others shuddering to their fate .
What feels he of the tree i planted ,
The tangled garden lies .
And i saw them go with pain .
Dusk as the sloping window takes its load :
It 's a song that soars and sings ,
Or with the tip , produce expressiveness .
Far voices of a joy that sought and missed her
Of scamps that ever cheered the devil .
And urged 'em to scatter and uphold the law ;
And none could know what came to be .
With wings that dip beyond the silver seas .
Composing new lyrics to whistle in spring .
The deadly grief that knows not cure ,
With tangled gossamer that fell by night ,
Which made them every one suspect
The kindly thoughts that rise ;
This way no righteous soul has ever gone ;
Should find how by chemic ways
Nor spills it , as careless boys do ;
But right or left as strikes the player goes ;
Shone and awoke the strong desire
The mighty saint , with glory crowned ,
The message that the kindling east shall send ;
The rushing water the wilderness covers ,
No second grief like this can pierce my soul .
He kept an anxious ear . the humming tone
This judgment just against all winds that blow .
That glory from him , snatching wrapt in clouds
That my intellect may find its share .
Our hearts , whose high affections burn alone
Still follows evil , came ; and raised the wind
I see a shadow of secret crimes .
But by thy sacrament communicate :
And find thee still true-hearted ;
Investing all the heart holds dear ; --
" where kisses freeze and love is snow .
My youth and joy consume .
She assumed by matilda , unconscious , perchance ,
Unless god gives the benedicite .
Who seeks the counsel of his friends ,
And find the regions of the infant day . '
With bitter words the king addressed .
With the deluge of summer it receives ;
And hence thy surname grew . i follow 'd then
She loosened from her diadem .
That architecture 's noble art is lost ! "
I leave your own good judgment to reply . "
James boyd took his leave of the noble king ,
Whither this foredoomed life is guided on
May the religion of the mountain feel ,
I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure ,
It chanced one day , when the north wind blew
Whose answering eyes put out the sun ?
Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies ? '
So shall the life that is to come restore
They found their women had , for comforts lost ,
Before the sun has dipped behind those trees .
She breathed her melancholy song : --
The long day 's march had well withstood --
When jove at distance drives the rolling war .
She heaved a sigh , and wiped her eye ,
Writ you in capitals , made you the chief
And , by the hope of victory fired ,
Blithe dreams arise to greet us
To pallas thus her winged words address 'd :
Your mother to that lonely shore did steer ,
No strength in my poor foot is found ;
It is her silence that no flute can drown ,
They forging sat calamity to troy .
Had voice when lowered heavens drummed for gales .
Some keep the sabbath going to church ;
Then , with a rushing sound the assembly bend
The road winds white among ashen hills
As some bright angel , armed with mercy ,
And came where five great rivers went their ways .
The shades that hid those whispering waters fail ,
To save the credit of their breaking bank :
And lapt in idleness and pleasure lay ;
The third day comes ; oh what a sin !
With prayer there came new thoughts and new desires .
That , crossed by shades and sunny gleams ,
The government bullock train toted its load .
The rich ones , on feasting are busily set ,
A fair face gazing in thee wondering wise ,
" on this side lies the foe ;
Nature that went with graceful form supplied ;
Though that bliss be shared with me .
_ seeking your glory by our paine _
Parts it may ravage , but preserves the whole .
A busy wind brought little tender smells
My bosom welled with joy ;
" when the weather sends you a chance visitor ?
Forth stepped aeneas , and the gauntlets weighed ,
When all their joys lie in their eyes .
That lies between thine eyelids and thine eyes ?
Were best made known to their master , too :
But tell of days in goodness spent ,
Love is immortal : this the price to pay .
To mark thy spirit soar above
And brilliant ideas would arrive on occasions ;
It seemed a city of towering masts arose ;
The waves beside them danced , but they
Which soaking through the friar , tries to cool
Goes down in tempest , there are loathsome things
Puts on the semblance here of sorrowing .
And tearful eyes had looked upon the wain ,
To keep this unexpected holiday ;
To ward aside the bitter doom of death :
And loaded up as a man when it chose ,
Was bathed in tears and strained with agony .
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore ,
That scotland led in luve and le ,
Each shadow makes him stop , each murmur stay :
Such virtue as resided in this spring .
Death comes not to relieve despair .
Whose bones portray a ghastly lust ;
Whose blast may put them all to sleep ,
Clear hallelujahs through heaven 's arches rolled .
Just to make a great show coming in .
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . "
The dwarf in anguish aims the vengeful wound ;
In days forever flown .
Lips that ripen to a kiss .
For the structure that we raise ,
Since then , although summer has followed frost
To look upon my woe ? how hast thou dared
Tired of toil , i sought for rest ,
And each forgets that his youth has fled ,
Nay , fear not . as is given
The shades renewed the pleasures life held dear :
From off his feet ; a strange emotion fills
Call now to mind the fury of your might ;
At england 's mercy ! could that force but grow
The difference only in their wit is shown , }
The mount where israel heard the law ,
And whelms the offenders in the roaring tides :
And set up strangest idols ? we could clip
I felt quite sure that god had set
Along the roads interminably bending ,
Would urge an end of everything ,
The little creature 's hues are gone ;
Where the reflected heavens wanly showed
The listening ear can trace .
And the lightning showed the sainted
This day to man came pledge of perfect peace ,
Man have by artful means my ruin sought ;
They struck the lips that they might have kissed ,
A strong expression most he seemed t ' affect ,
To her heart straight went _ both _ arrows ,
But a single word of unkindness speak ,
Summer lies low ;
The eager joy felt climbing up a mountain
Worth being poor to hold in fee .
Heaped honeysuckles ; roses lavishing beams ,
Whose death leaves living drear ?
And hidden , dispers 'd truths that folded lie
They also led me from a virtuous wife ,
Yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread ;
Who hold a kindred spirit in their souls :
Assent they gave with heart and hand ;
That makes old emptinesses stare in wonder ;
To meet the charge that treason hurls
I feel an icy shiver !
Which held its passage through the panting heart ,
Or exercise their spite in human woe ?
A hearty welcome found .
And pain was succeeding ,
Scatters his freshest , tenderest green .
Living , your squandered gems and lilies shed !
Occupied , felt at once their courage fall ' n.
The sun was sunk , and after him the star
And hold to virtue with a loyal will ,
Sounds that are born of rapture and bliss ,
With buttercup buds to follow .
Where topless towers shadow golden streets ,
They go their way with looks demure ,
Their life and vigour shall renew .
And feel the sea beneath them sink and lift ,
My lonely arms i spread in woe ,
With clouds of purple shines the sky ,
Nor follow him , as childhood used of old ,
And fashioned such a music , wild and free ,
The ocean roared , heralding soon
It follows not the man was kill 'd :
Set her grief at thee , turned in a heat
Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains ;
Save to wait for the sign to come :
The flowers that sweetest breathe ,
In him the noblest glories meet .
Their fortune has conducted to his tower . "
The music that puts light into the spheres ;
Its hundred ribs spread wide to throw
The seeds of actions planted long ago ,
The grateful worm spun its winter tomb ,
Earth 's easter answer came ,
The vast plains which the veiled horizon bounded ,
Her for so much compassion . here she sank
Which made him in a deadly fret .
Could not gain a higher wisdom ,
All fell together , crumbling in disgrace ,
Drowns my spirit , draws my breath ?
That much allowance must be made for men .
And with the great athenians join their force .
The heart will lightly hold ,
And summat made me think of things
And all the thunder of the battle raged , )
Lifted by thee above the gulf of time
It passed : the morning came : in vain ,
And that great king hell first took hold upon
Till labour claims the privilege of toil
And heaped the camp with mountains of the dead ;
Thus the nightingales made speedy answer :
And returned in sullen humour
And turned to scorn , and grown contemptible --
That has passed over : so this may depart !
Shall see the kings full glory break ,
And the ancient dreams come true !
Who shines exalted on the ethereal plain ,
As to the north i took my way ,
Whatever hope in vivian 's heart remained .
Soon do i follow thither !
And custom into second nature grows .
Had fame with laurels crowned me , --
The mad course goes across the silent plain ,
The elm-leaves softly stirred ,
I shall feel my own lips tremble
That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs ,
That brave spirit comes again .
Seeing how your church had divined the heart ,
Hateful to me shone forth the blessed sun ,
Oft her orphaned lot awakes my tear ,
His scattered legions , and beats ruin back ,
By magic was men 's greatness wrought .
With words that fell like flakes of wintry snow ,
( the pilot made reply )
Which from the press of battle freely flows ;
That at her flowery work doth sing ,
A palace caught the rays of dawn .
And thicker shadows cast ,
Although a dark cloud swept over the plain ,
Scarlet plumes that flaunt and float
An ' we to share in common ;
When will return the glory of your prime ?
That holds the strongest fast , can him detain ,
Since summer 's garishness is gone ,
Of homely toil , may serve to show
What joy was this that filled his heart anew ?
You love me , and i find you still
The months i count : how long it seems
On evenings when autumnal winds have stirred
This was the sunshine that hath given the man
And three forgotten mounds mark the rude graves ,
He sought to gain no learned degree ,
Carried new joy to all their gentle kindred .
They bring the human heart wherein
The waters gave no sound ,
While the billows o'er me roll ,
All troy stood trembling at the mighty man :
But that to warriors who this course have run ,
Striving to hide their grief from argive eyes .
Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh ,
Trade ends where yon far clover ridges swell .
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking ,
Where a beech tree cast its shade ,
From his teeth sprang branching pine-trees .
" my clay with long oblivion is gone dry :
And the hot tears rise and blind him .
Whole squadrons oft in panic ran ,
And no proud honour to thyself redounds .
Straight terror fell on him , and trembling bowed
Beneath which ran an ample water 's tide ,
I 'll see what can for you be done .
This doth invite me , this assurance give me
And left the shuddering human creature bare .
Where the musical birds had a concert prepared .
To make believe that thou art gone ?
Since first his black flag he unfurled ,
The song began from jove ,
She felt the void which mined her breast ,
And all your rights maintain .
Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief shall send ;
Erroneously given by the court .
And bathed in tears his features and his face .
Fitzgerald 's first inspiration comes from o. 73 .
It shines for me , no shadows mar ,
Where mortal weakness stands confessed ?
Heaven ’s portals stand open thy soul to receive ,
Each takes , and then his visage wan
Sweet pleasing slumbers softly raise .
With warmer wishes sent .
Thus made reply : " he is indeed alive ,
And whisper his love for her .
The light of thee not set nor flown .
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given ,
But casts no shadow on the unconscious head
That here his hunting closes with the great :
And put a period to your gladsome days ,
Her life is that heaven brought down ;
I find i can not swallow .
And then the lorries flung along
We felt the menace
Answer in the words which follow :
Right faithfully his _ oath _ he kept ,
Where the sea shook and the gulf yawned blank ,
The freedom so longed for is given .
And how it might be placed :
Than the sad object of such sport be made .
It passeth vigil and the shadows cleareth .
The water , as the wind passed o'er ,
The things that make up earth 's concern .
How silent comes the water round that bend !
I say unto all hearts that can not rest
Albeit thereat my footing holds , nor slips ,
That tell where heroes lie .
This fame which you have caught :
Where time has forgotten for aye to pass ,
I envy not the joy the pilgrim feels ,
And love lay asleep in a violet bed .
Till all the earth of peace shall sing .
Bewailing thir excess , all terror hide .
To quell the pang of its keen misery ;
Will hail the twilight and the star ,
Great gabel from his summit sends a voice ,
The culminating seasons rolled ;
Before the stars have left the skies ,
That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs ,
She at my door till dawn shall stand ,
With shining shields that turn the torches dim .
I sing -- the change brought round last year
They had to run well to win money ;
Not one alone on whom my wrath could seize ,
Must not swim the sea of anger ,
We close our eyes and go to sleep :
With pain whose surge i felt to anguish grow ;
Shot through the firmament .
The shadow back , and then gave chase again ,
Has left his hope with all .
He him to further his desire has swayed ;
It dies and leaves her paler than before .
A son whose kingdom death 's arm lies across ,
And filled their hearts with flame .
Their stillness answering his cry ,
To catch a glance from his drowsy eye ,
It can never know defeat ,
Shall pierce the ravenous monster through . ”
And half an hour has scarcely passed
But horror through my brain went crashing --
The kitchen clock ran down and struck the hour ,
And purple standards floating on the gale :
While we were gazing , life and motion took .
These build as fast as knowledge can destroy ;
Have gathered music for a tale of tears .
That can not reach the south .
Either bore the other deadly hate at heart .
And with the warmest love that he could show ,
And the hills where the gods made their home ?
Now freedom appears from the world to have flown ,
The drifting petal came to ground .
Lest if we entered , peace would go .
The maid ( and thereby hangs a tale )
The evening sunk in sorrow down .
Must in their framework hold some air , because
The twining glyphs of perfect you and me --
Now the seated eyes find rest ;
The care she gave to him .
For winter maketh the light heart sad ,
If learning his chief lesson makes him wise .
Dusk is falling ; i feel the dew ;
Where peace had built her downy nest ,
Set thy guard over us ,
As morning broke , the light wind died away ,
The slow tongue speaks :
When the stars give quiet light ,
Till it reached home , where learned age should greet
Or shall we straightway flee a city doomed ?
When first ambition struck at regal power ;
His azure glowed as a cloud worn thin ,
The footsteps of persephone we trace .
While chief baron ear sat to balance the laws ,
And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul .
When earth shall feel thy fast consuming ray --
And makes their law of life his guide ,
For never death can come more happily
But yonder the forests stand verdant in flora
An ' my heart feels light an ' gay ,
Did not the witch of endor bring the ghost
And every nation that should lift again
Kisses my sleepless lids and burning temples .
Too mean and small to harbor pride ,
But ever , when the wintry days drew near ,
The tiptoe tulips stand ,
Life held delicious offerings perished here ,
Did he know what with it came ?
Where joy was lost as well as pain ?
And ask for your protection !
Their constant ward and watching kept .
And passeth out by the way it came .
By the same heavenly instinct taught and led ,
The brandished sword of god before them blazed ,
Marched handcuffed down that sworded street ,
He fired with praise , or with persuasion moved .
Those best can bear reproof who merit praise .
Whilst we with happy hearts our circuit keep ,
Still as one drops , another takes his place ,
" of kingly right can france demand ?
That swims into some blue and open bay
Indeed in the mansion no pains will he spare ,
New splendour on thy lineage throws . ”
With the crash of splintered beams that fly ,
Breaking the silence of the seas
Murdered by him whom the law holds highest , --
Thou ! who for many a year hast stood
Of low winds sweeping free ,
On each side an imperial city stood ,
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking ,
As a shut coop that holds a hen ,
And shed one tear for him whose latest prayer
That from bluest heaven can bring
For what truth means to man
Just now a wave of perfume floated up
Shoo cam to mak folks ' hearts feel glad ,
Be tasted ere it work ; the last exceeding
Till the breezes hail their essence ;
And the billows that broke on gosh 's shore
And the dead lips moved and smiled ,
The arrow met him in his swift career
Let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither !
And , with the lust of battle fired ,
Take thou my heart , lord jesus ,
Which leads thee with its motherly control ,
The moon at moments breaking bright ,
Your eyes said more to me that night
Then , while the chiefs in still attention hung ,
( eyes that i could not meet ! )
The lithe whip curling on our track ,
My clay with long oblivion is gone dry :
The cold ground doth not cover them ,
Then all the rafters rang with song again : --
Roses are beautiful to bind one 's brow ,
So in the mind of nature now awakes ,
Death brings another april to the soul .
For heathen heart that puts her trust
Many are the hearts looking for the right ,
Where the evil spirits harbour ,
And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood . "
" and medicine , that strives to heal
The weak brain may serve to amaze ,
That mercy i to others show ,
Where all the spices grow .
' t will give you pleasant happiness ,
A commoner should fill a throne .
To see if i can find my love ,
To follow him now half divine ,
Where flames refined in breasts seraphic glow :
The city bides the foe .
I followed ; what the chance of victory
They went by chance , amidst their talk ,
And honour , as long as waves shall break ,
As though some other name ran in his head .
Speak aloud the words which follow :
One hour hath spent , in one unlucky fight ;
The coming of the snow-storm told .
But never such a cheerful spirit bore .
Tell him england hath taken me !
They follow in the track of day ,
Life brought them first to kiss the light
With her husband to make a start .
In vain the laws their feeble force oppose ,
That felt the force of angry hell ?
And through the trembling worlds he flies ,
My ripening corn shines golden in the sun ;
With the lurking drop of blood that lies
All my terrors soon shall rise . "
But we , to whom our age allows
The seasons came , the seasons passed ,
But he parforce his fortune must abide .
And make this our chief holiday ;
And i 'll give thee a silver pound ,
Life fills mine urns of song .
Not silence separates , but speech ;
The world , so as the vision says ,
Then instant aid was given .
Still haunt the path our rambles took ;
She strayed out one day
Each fearlessly his weapon draws ,
His egotism rose , fed by the hurt :
Of our own home , and sink to sleep
Security hast render 'd me , and drawn
Soon the sweet river feels the icy chain ,
" cease your bloodshed , " cried the hermit ,
It shall never go to mana ,
I shall find my love -- the one
These sounds i 'll strive to catch ;
Gone the peace and love i knew
Since they held in their hearts the holy teachings ,
Where sorrow enter 'd not ,
She shares the eternal calm .
And each alone he laid and exorcised
On fields where strife held riot ,
But many joined the throng of animate drops ,
Calls in the country , catches opening glades ,
With the first dream that comes with the first sleep
O'er their laughter rang his scolding :
Of joyous hopes that came to naught .
And in did come the strangest figure !
All madly dancing through the pleasant valley ,
Give thy love -- and ask not ,
And discus , showed his radiant face ,
That answer he found none .
She left her joyful harpings in the sky ,
Make love , gain , duty , manifest ,
Afloat the galleys tugged the mooring-chain :
For thus the royal mandate ran ,
The birds were singing still ; leaves flashed and swung
Hearts set about with gold encompassed them .
Harp of the hebrew seer ! be thine to break
To strew above the withered hours .
To view the heroes , and their wants relieve .
Let his name and his verses go .
How softly sinks his trembling sun
Winters of memory seemed to roll ,
In vain poured forth as watersprings ,
To lift some weight with sick assay ,
But my weary wings could not follow my vision --
No cure we see with troubled eyes :
Doth from the vision , that reflects the scene .
That i brought a dread burden down here --
In azure mazes rolling o’er the earth ,
Here wakened our history first ,
When sweet airs come seaward
We 'll , innocently , steal celestial fire ,
My soul has died a thousand deaths ,
And his longing , still withheld !
And thus add friendship unto admiration .
Here set i down some dreams that come again ,
Yet those in daily converse see no change
To pass their days in poverty and pain ;
And human steps drew nigh ,
" i feel the soul in me draw near
Blossoms are blown . no bold hills nor mountains
Towards friends and town he throws an anxious glance .
And time brings truth , and truth makes free ,
And cut the branch ; to save the shock
( the weeping necromancer answer made , )
The might of royal teucer then arose ,
For lurking dread this speech within her stirred ;
O'er it the feet of the seasons go ;
Through the soft evening air enwinding all ,
To drive the cold winter away .
The wind that chanced to blow that day
And profit gained slower the longer would last .
She holds her way , and i look with joy
That flashed from out the heavens , and a cross
Cheerly the waving pennons fly ,
Lay something that still turn 'd the thoughtful heart
And the gray-beard thus made answer :
To find the present with a kiss .
And all is love , embracing and embraced .
To fly at all that rises in her sight ;
That give sway their motion to the stars .
As a spark away is drifted .
And felt that tempest brooding round his heart ,
In other folds our mischiefs would upwrap .
And , blending with their dulcet tones ,
There is no wind sighs on the sleepy wave ,
It breaks his heart that kings must murder still ,
Speak truly what your hearts advise ,
Has found his upward way , i answer thee ,
And new-born pleasure brings to happier men ;
“ brother , reflect : the wise control
He set a price on the precious store ,
And gives each sampson 's strength toward the blow ,
" or leave a kiss but in the cup
To make thy self a welcome inmate there :
As on the land once fell the northern foe ,
And time and space have rushed in between ,
And his face broke to beauty as it smiled .
It quite outvies the lily leaf .
Ye deal is felt the wide earth through ;
And make the foes of england
Pain of pleasures not yet won ,
That makes thee hurry in this wise ? "
Dost give full rein across the fires that glow
Pale and dismayed his spurs the caitiff plied
There were the softest carpets spread ,
These men . the great guns rise ;
Not hate itself could find one black enough ,
To bed why followed they me not straight ? ”
Behind the moorish tents to make his way ,
As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth ,
Fame had whispered in thine ear ,
The knife might shed upon her as she stood ,
The lovers fled , the tearful stream remains ,
And a forest round it rolls .
Some pirates steered that way .
Mrs. cole 's voice came from an inner room :
And in the prize we found its name .
When the impregnate air retains the thread ,
Yet bore sir hugh an aching heart
And found therein a narrow vein of love .
Exhausted , leans on all that can impart
The dusky braid begins to dance upon her breast --
To keep the light within , to fitly scorn
Not without fear i bring myself to speak ;
All things decay with time : the forest sees
Newton , the first whose thought could soar beyond
Is asserted by starvation ?
And pass forth silent . each divine veiled head
To the next merry lad let it pass ;
For in pure love heaven did prepare
On his pillow , from whence the screaming came .
Mother most dear i make this birthday prayer .
And from their hearts rises more prayer and praise
She took the path across the leaze .
It seeks to learn the virtue of thy hand .
And the sweet name is floating in thy ear .
Tired and weary i fell into a doze .
With the breaking of bands ye are broken ,
Reason 's comparing balance states the course :
Like a black pall gathers thickly ,
The doubtful war , and mutual deaths they dealt .
And still his love descends on all the race :
That melts to mingle with its kindred fire ,
And stormy winds and waves obey his will !
One slight objection i see ;
Our beelzebub chorus has gone off but ill .
Which of my wrongs builds a triumphal arch ,
The battle-eager maid . the red blood leapt
The breeze runs mad before it blows a storm ;
To the river ran the mother ,
Clear from the fountain , singing as it goes ,
That closes the soul in a crypt of dread
Whose coming for his safety paves the way :
" the haughty dares in the lists appears :
" no weariness , o death , i feel ,
Where heart with heart could hold sweet speech ,
And on the top a path runs .
And so remould the features it gives back :
Of life that knows nor origin nor end .
While the cat is taking lessons on the drum .
Cries pierce the very heavens on every part .
With thunder roar begins to rush , --
Joy , that transcends all sweetness of delight .
But thou hadst lost the power of beguiling ,
Till death shall break the empty cup .
Give , give the answer that i seek .
Disturb the wells whence that sad stream takes birth ,
Thine eyes , my love ! i see .
The shadows grow ;
Our sins reflect their own dark shadows there : --
I somehow feel that they are kind ,
The peahen languishing with love .
In cups of gold that shed a yellow light ,
To crowne an uncontrouled fate ,
And setten him to his penance
Tossing torrent lights , find way ;
She found him sleeping sound .
And could scarce restrain the blossoms
Where the silence cried aloud ;
Nor give thy thoughts a ply to future scenes ?
That the green sea washed my way ! " --
In leaves might find communion --
The bells made music all around
And the rigging stirs , and the lanterns stare ;
And the red rose would but blow more red ,
That holds with me twin memories
And my heart hath gathered honey of many dreams .
The greeks stood witness , all our army heard .
Cold waxed his heart , and weary and distraught ,
And put himself upon his good behaviour :
Dreams that fill with vague surmise
And deadly nightshade , that makes men see ghosts ;
And each had shown how light we far 'd along
In the sky the leaping sun !
Where the artist 's scenes are shifted .
Tears that fall in burning streams ;
There are crush 'd hearts that will not break ;
To descant on the doubts of my decay .
Though the wind hath fallen , they drift along ,
I grieve for that already shed ;
Wherefore relax a space and take thy pleasure ,
Earnest as one that looks into the book ,
Whose shadows serve to hide
The morning breeze new pleasure seeks ;
The hot tears welling from his eyes —
But overhead a trembling shadow stole ,
Now dying groans invade the ear ,
I draw the living water of your love .
Let the wretch go festering through florence ) --
That people , which to evil pass were brought .
On jesus ' bosom naught but rest is found .
So shakespeare rests who scorned to lie with kings ,
Great nature , break thy chain , that links together
I shall feel my own lips tremble
Might lodge secure and plan most daring deeds .
Love makes the monarch but a bashful boy ,
And a clock to mark you the passing hour
Or through what ancient veins our blood has rolled ?
There withdraw upon the instant .
Scarce showing the fanged edge of one hungering lip
No tyrant 's mandates echo from this wall ,
And passing heavy grew the hearts of all ,
That wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine
Over the stile the stars hang yellow . --
Lies a deep hollow , from whose ragged brows
The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread ,
Long on the deep the mists of morning lay ,
A flock that caught at wiles , because
God can only set in motion :
But confidence then bore thee on ; secure
Poverty still comes to sever
But with that cruel weapon lost their life
Wounds that pierce his tender body . "
To no happy living soul is revealed ! "
Faith is kept in those blest regions yonder
Who scribble stuff to meet the public need .
To do what they had gladly left undone ,
Lofty grass is waving o'er them
Her glorious fancies come from far ,
And thou hast made each step an onward one ;
Which lies between romagna and the realm
Still may the fates thy valued life maintain . --
Save energy of mind which steers the limbs ?
And she fell in love with gay win sil
The moon bends o'er the waters lying still .
So ran the banter at pennarby mine .
They 'll get the warning of my drum .
That made men find an oracle in the books
Bending as he swept the chords
Which flashing roared from crags of ribbed snow ,
Your last caresses brewed .
Young romance raised his dreamy eyes ,
Burst sunward and in feverish fragments lay .
Of her a gift , a task that tires :
Even through the city where the dusty roads run ,
Befell him , which i now relate .
A memory mastering pleasure and all pain ,
And yet thy mercy sought .
Sweet voices we heard in the days gone before ,
Voices may come to swell the choral song
Machinery just meant
My brother gave that name to me
And the black-robe chief made answer ,
For i have gained thy confidence , have pledged
Put forth protection . liberty alone
The burial office read ,
" let the cause thy attention engage :
From whence the housewives ' cloth did come :
She purposed the same messenger should bear
Bring the prayer of a little one . "
Thou place thy trust ; let not the entrance broad
By which such bliss is given ;
Which makes his life a constant tragedy .
The very pine is feeling it ;
Of this grim secret make an end .
Or under any hedge his house is made .
The spring comes with a full heart silently ,
And dreary visions in thy absence come ;
" what says the sea , little shell ?
The wind that comes from the frozen hill .
To take a smooth answer ,
That giveth me the captain of the church
Where the marsh meadows lie
Its phantom bark a silent phantom steers .
But it was seen by bishop fuller ,
At whose command whole empires rise or fall :
But town or village found the warrior none .
Without our assistance they could not go coursing . "
Like a whirlwind it goes ,
The false lights that on objects shone
Adore him , who to compass all this dies ;
Thy tender melting eyes they own ;
To stay their overthrow ;
He put soft enchantment into spare wine and bread .
But heaven , that brings out good from evil ,
For a week there ran an ermine
There to hold his wedding feast ;
But as night came , she fancied elenor
On him this melancholy man bestowed
And cowering conscience cautioned them to shun
And grief goes out , and joy comes in ,
And the blood ran down like rain .
With dreams that in my fitful slumber came ,
Invites fresh grapes to fill his press with wine .
To their hives their treasures bring :
While the eternal ages watch and wait .
And restitution 's edict seal and bind
I feel within my blood old battles flow --
While rolling flames from roman turrets fly ,
't is love that makes the heavens shine
Yet may it grow restrained by habit , prince !
For something hidden , something owed .
Most grateful odors greet the well-charmed sense ,
The stars came here and there .
That holds all fathomless eternity ,
This bitter truth he soon was made to feel ,
Which hangs over the ice where lies the road .
Oh , give us pleasure in the orchard white ,
To-night at roslin leads the ball ,
Would make the sailing better , though we know
To where my warmest wishes rove ;
That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect
To seize at once the promised joy .
I feel that joy was dwelling there ,
That god hath given them room for hope ,
Now to the waves the bursting clouds descend ,
To bring back comfort thence unto that faith ,
Taking the deadly love of death away ,
And his heart was filled with sorrow ,
And yet it keeps a faded trace
Those we term poor shall oft that wealth obtain ,
Many pleasures still remain .
No jealousy shall make a breach ,
And the oak-tree gave him answer ,
God gives to man the power , 220 .
Speak they their lineage , or their names declare ?
Far as the eye can reach it goes ,
And joe and billy take a ride .
His giant foes round ráma pressed
That drove men out to kill .
Thro ' fingers dulled by age .
Then arrived the time for starting ,
Where the osier pathway leads --
Of honest parents , and may serve my turn .
And sleeps so sound it draws no breath ,
The year is wearing to the wane ,
And through the town the glad applause attends .
Her hand shrunk from him , and the color fled
On whom to ask blessings that come from above .
That passed with him in such-like way ;
Thus it comes that i am pregnant . "
Was roses gather 'd from the south ,
Which would allay the fever , or imply
At treasures that glitter and torches that blaze --
Would find fault with his great paintings ,
The haze is swimming where the beeches stand ;
The royal power which others leave ,
And rising from the sickness drear
And souls of sinners find it barred ,
As if a finger on their lips were laid !
Answered in the words which follow :
In ages past . i feel myself exalted
Kindled and quenched , unto the motion coming
And breathed devout , with voice restrained ,
Sealed in a sleep which knows no wakening .
How fatal were the beams they threw ,
No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm ,
New scenes surround me , new ambitions seize , --
The lark sends down his flickering lay , --
To catch at her heart she laid one hand :
But time , a gentle nurse , shall wipe away
So saying , he kindled the desire to weep
The glory given thee for a grace to give ,
The searching knife must pierce into the heart ,
Held her breath and durst not stir ,
Loud claps of thunder shook the sons of pride ,
No life worth naming ever comes to good
To ask the gods thy misery to show ,
Warriors and charioteers their places took .
Where truth reigns the work goes on ,
To many a foe i dealt a ruthless doom ,
To reach a land unknown .
Guided by his own faith in newton 's law :
No recognition of his genius came :
Then came this heavy cursing gabalus ,
Incense and word fill the evening with prayer .
Each is an avenue leading
He thinks they can not as regards all else ,
They form 'd their schemes to blast our fame :
And now what lands between us lie ,
His conscience felt an hell :
Save a flush that goes and comes ,
Where fortune bears no sway o'er things ,
She gave a prison for a throne .
Round his pale temples play .
And every face has smiles to greet your presence .
Where the great wall round china goes ,
And darkness falls , with scornful thunder ,
And morning filled their cups with dew ,
Where never before a grave was made ;
Whose practicality saw i can suppose
One joy alone was left to bring
( the sunlight sinks upon the sea ) ,
The song was silent , and the dance expired :
Leads the sad heart through valleys dark as night ,
With his thy forfeit lands and treasures blend ;
And held to each full gaiety and wit ,
Lay , felt not , twenty withered years .
But wit and judgment join at once in you ,
Through tingling silence of the frosty night --
To marry , and make me at ease !
There 's mony ane that trails in silk
Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe .
And the alms he gave as a christian
To bring all things unto a happy end .
Each day , no answer ever gives content .
So not for the rainbow taken
What time the pea puts on the bloom ,
Can make me absolutely confident --
Midst languid thoughts of greater bliss he lay ,
Now with friendly homage pays ,
Of music swung in utter calm
And then he trembled hard and broke out praying ,
The rest lay waste , unless wild beasts unseen ,
Destroys himself and others drags to death .
Nor cups of poison stay ? who say thereby
Which over my life had passed
And moved to happiness our inmost blood ,
Drops its surrendered sweetness note by note ; --
Then mutual slaughters spread on either side ;
The multitude 's grave shepherd , took full flight ,
The merchant , to secure his treasure ,
Both give bliss ;
That sat so still and melancholy there : --
Best ask your theologians that question .
Whose sad young eyes grow on us from the page
Lilith a-tiptoe stood ; upreaching , caught
And strives to show his own illegal ties ;
To catch the day-break of thy dawn .
Thy ever-youthful waters keep
Spake at last the words that follow :
It will bring relief to thine aching brow ,
Their country 's love to war encouraged ,
Show 'd war more awful than the mirror gave ;
Filled the drowsy air with buzzing ,
What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more !
The words of truth which she addressed to thee !
What secrets tell my heart thou hast not told ?
To see fair england 's standards fly . "
Then wise ulysses in his rank was placed ;
As he grew very old . it opened where
If memory to these no trophies raise . "
And utterly consumed with sharp distress ,
It is not love i feel , but fear ;
Anticipation forward points the view ;
Spirit , substantial form , with matter join 'd
And here follow some general observations upon the experience :
Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too ,
And her thoughts ran on as follow :
Driven from cities by his restless moods ,
The fire of love must aye be kept alive .
But when to horror his amazement rose ,
Fire all-consuming ran among the ships ,
Of herself survey she takes ,
And every prince enjoys the gift he made :
Columbia , kept the field .
Number and value reach infinity .
Refines the bosom it trembles thro '
Yet leave thee lonely in the throng of men --
Life like a star shall climb the height ,
Oh then i should fix my humour .
There came a " yow ! "
My heart turned troubled at the ominous thing :
At thy breath are steeped in tears .
The last hope is gone ,
In time he shall know what it meant .
That darkness is about to pass .
This while sir pinnabello had drawn near
Perhaps full many a heavy hour had passed ,
And with new fervor filled the hearts of men ,
That dainty odours from them threw around ,
Such numbers fell , such heroes sunk to night ;
If she followed the ways of her mother .
And said that no salve could save ;
Which naught from virtue ’s path can move . ”
The screams and hootings rose again :
Tears of burning sorrow shed ,
Joys that her stormy raptures never yield .
But the heart left lone must sorrow on ,
Glitters that pure , emerging light ;
Where music grows and beauty is unchained .
A cruel tyrant , by no sanctions bound ,
Filled the time as they sped onward .
Oh , give thine own sweet rest to me ,
Historic buildings , where they sometimes rested ,
With kisses welcoming , caresses sweet .
My soul intent allows no other thought
That shall thy bridal bring .
The second who upon her heart had rested
Till all with joy its richest blessings taste ,
A shimmering air the golden calm was weaving ,
With ease my happy fancies come and go ,
His awkwardness vanished , his muscles all strained --
His words were brief , with bitter fury flung :
" but now by steam we run our race ,
A child so negligent ? thy garments share ,
Should pierce through the red wet crumpled roses
My chicken temptingly reposes ,
Her slow consent had wrought .
Following the cross , your pale procession led ,
God gave unto him knowledge and wit ,
While clouds were gathering round his head ,
Was placed the daughter of king stordilane :
The clock run down and struck a chime
He feels his wounds , but who shall tell
Like a fen-fire -- winked and lured
( such pride he in adoring took ) ,
He ceased his crying , gave a sigh ,
When the sweatin ' troop-train lay
No efforts are made to afford them relief :
And never his love could see , --
Come ! for countless gifts she bears ;
Whose watch we feel but can not see ,
To avoid great errors , must the less commit :
Has made wreck of the peace within --
That the lost scholar long was seen to stray ,
The day shall come ( which nothing can avert )
Thence it descends to the last potencies ,
God 's universe has boundless worlds to show ;
Thy word their force can stay ;
Death , only death , the question can resolve .
Time will reveal the calyxes of gold .
Stalk 'd shrieking dreadful ; me pale horror seized .
And clear his orders came ,
To the lands of america urging their claim ,
I will not vex my calm with grief ,
A soul that rose up in this hollow shell
And living islands float upon the lakes .
And pay the dues that yet remain . ”
The circling year had filled its course ,
Eager for battle , will rise and arm .
Till the fierce din to pleasing murmurs fell ,
Is gone , but there the arrows lie ;
Barley and rye , the tether 'd horses stood
But these meadows have never known change .
For it must lead to a happy land ,
Lost in this pleasing ecstasy ,
" shoot folly as it flies " ?
And give my weary bones a peaceful grave .
Apollo 's self might pass unheard ,
And my illustrious country , led me here . "
Gave you those eyes of wandering fire ,
Terror came at length upon him ,
By pointing at his origin , and end ;
Love summons them here straightway to divorce
And sighs perfumed which do the flowers unfold ,
That wraps in mystery the things i see ,
There lover-like with lips and limbs that meet
Heart with heart divinely blending ,
As him was set in covenant :
Put forth that noblest strength , thine own .
We welcome the holy season 's return .
To show the gloom more hideous for the foil ,
And prompted by malice , prohibit the sale .
Make my mortal dreams come true
Against the golden clasps that join 'd his belt ;
For dissolution wrought by sin , that first
The muse still brought her soothing power ,
Which smiled on me in thee with earliest ray :
The heaven such grace did lend her
Because he deemed by magic it was wrought ;
Time has dulled their dread .
As he that met his likeness in the stream :
But make the absolute best of what god made .
Making new year 's calls .
I give the first watch of the night
That lead us steadily on to the grave .
What various swains our motley walls contain !
To new appearance . meeting these , there came ,
Apart from one who had no sin to show ,
So , wiser i judged it to make
Draws tears of pity from a barber 's block !
And not even love can live on flowers .
You saw my passion for you from the start .
The light died out ; a mask
Yet , lest the queen be driven now to restore
Who there falls into prayer for ecstasy
My heart would find the years more lonely here
That goes to christmas pantomimes -
Had such a debt to pay .
Thy brows are crowned with circling gold .
Suffers the mind and with our body feels .
Light-king his armies is throwing .
This work that my hands have made ,
Hath laid her babe to rest ;
As each were keeping some most prosperous tryst ,
Your little stories are made of silk .
Saint gabriel came from god to say ,
No wind of mine shall ever blow you back .
And man 's lust roves the world untamed .
By penance ' aid some gracious boon may gain .
And gives new life , unconscious that it gives .
Which , though , as english records run ,
And get it , happy as waring then ,
Wrought by the artist ’s skill , was seen
When his hour for death had come ,
His instinct teaches , and with growing dread ,
And of his crying cruelty complained ,
Finds his new sex , and feels ecstatic fire ;
Which passes into beauty , and is merged
The record there of friendships held like rocks ,
Melanthius marked his plight : swiftly he sprang
It longs for the unquiet sea ,
Up hither like aereal vapours flew
And taken in exchange -- my youth .
His tale the mournful cavalier so taught ;
Ill tidings down she drew ,
That might stir up reprisal in the dead .
Swelling the breeze that sighed along the lengthening glen .
In one sobbing cry together swept .
I dare not trace that watching space
That runs in forest wyld ,
The just faliscans he to battle brings ,
Where midst the dead her home is made ;
And still it rang that wee bird 's song ;
The clouds were gone , the horizon overspread
Ere i had reached the age of sixty .
May secure the thing of evil ? "
So on , beating , to her street :
In music it is flowing .
Shadows the fields where england 's thunder comes .
Where balkh amidst the desert stands !
With silver glitter caught
That gives on gardens of enchanted light ,
While each a fond attention paid
Ages and ages returning at intervals ,
Give my love fame faster than time wastes life ,
Earth , set free from thy fair fancies
And thitherward the stranger took his way .
While from his breast these dreadful accents broke .
Even one maintained in peacefulness ,
This gives you a safe pint to rest on ,
But juno , impotent of passion , broke
And thought 's world lives in thy
April came to bloom and never dim december
Would scorch the hand that ventured to rebuild thee ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Which once corrupted takes the worser part ;
When thickest dark did trance the sky ,
Hard task to hit the palate of such guests ,
Where the miracle lies anchored . "
Like wealthy men who care not how they give .
Her hand closed on the locket bitterly .
At every trifle scorn to take offense ,
So she her self-surrender might secure ,
She stirred the fire of life to flame ,
Ere the day come when memory shall o'ercrowd
Thine was the arm which vainly stayed the fight .
Yet who that looks to history 's damning leaf ,
The task now falls into the public hand ;
The toil it takes to make a business grow .
And pure the motive that your actions fed ;
Strange art of love ! that can make sound ,
As that thou set me up a blind ,
In rendering james your prayers and loyalty .
Gave birth to deeds that language fails to name .
Should sail from fog and chilly airs to skies
I shall bring thee in and lay thine hand
And left the breathless warrior in his gore .
As pure a mess almost as it came in ;
Her human heart to breaking , -- we who miss
And hold his kingdom high .
How shall his rashness stand the dire alarms ,
Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself
The guilt of zion 's sacred bard pursued .
And come of high degree ;
In most unqueenly posture , found .
It rushes on , besprinkling all the sea
One prying doubt to shake his faith sublime ;
With equal eyes beholds the wrongs i bear .
Codes that they might consent to follow laws .
Search where his shelving banks descend ,
A parting step or two he made ;
All life that breathed within the waving wood .
A shout of triumph mounted up thus high ,
High courage . shrieks had startled from their sleep
From our first loves the first fair verse arose ,
But the hopes of all will languish
That hangs like a halo of grace
Most fair when the streams of it run distraught
When they together short discourse had held ,
And these again , if fame says true ,
He had fanned afresh the burning brands
And with my present love have straight replaced .
Orpheus could lead the savage race ,
And live , at length , as nature taught ;
War followed war ; from conquest , conquest sprang .
Where the sky and the meadows meet .
She leaves the unfinished tale , in pain ,
Ere his lips could frame their usual call ,
Nor upset the can that holds it ? "
And comes the answer to psyche 's quiz .
No secret hides , and thalia , smiling one ,
Or as much cash as you could raise on
But vulcan leaves diana to the feasts ,
Drawn by the rumour of such carnage , came
Spinning the unnumbered threads that time hath woven ,
And sends in shouts applauses to the skies .
His living temples , built by faith to stand ,
Which of her lovers ever found her true ?
The judge was one they ought to shelve ;
For they stick it rather askew .
Softlier than moth 's her pinions trembled ;
It sit a king wel to be chaste ,
Light has been given you for good and evil ,
I gather some conclusion .
( as our own young england adjusts a jaunty tie
Such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds
And law was from necessity received . [ b ]
By the sun 't was warmed and softened ,
And , scattering flowers above and round about ,
What -- hourly gazing on a life forlorn ,
Large spoils retain 'd ; the rest among the crowd
Of penance . every way it turns :
The human heart can bear ,
Giving as much of ardour as it finds .
Take heart ! the promised hour draws near ;
Here machiavelli 's earth returned to whence it rose .
The air is filled with some unknown perfume ;
Of old they leaned on thy eternal word ,
While debts at home excite their care for those
Whom asia makes her champions , by your might
From blackened hearth the joyful flames leap up ,
And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven
No charge he gave to mere recruits in guilt
That tell no hour but that of dinner ;
When the evening comes in darkness ,
Hierusalem is seated on two hills
Made each thine absence so distract my breast ,
Nor served it to relax their serried files .
Not long the silence followed :
But young periander , from the shadow cleared ,
The seas run high and the boats split asunder ....
And you wept when my tones pealed loud ;
Too well i know what that weariness means .
Summer had followed winter , radiant , rich ,
Were in some part neglected and made void . "
But locked in slumber fast and deep
Who knows what sorrow moves her ,
Were the heart seen as is the outward cheer ,
The pale which held that lovely deer :
Lost his footing , and over the perilous brow
A faith that helps one die --
Violets bury one half the splendour
Now comes your christian idea : let me die ,
Yet these are things invested in my mood
And settled sorrow of the quiet eyes ,
The sun beat hot , and thirstily
Where the princess met her wooer ,
Next , he set forth the prizes , to reward
To fix the model in his heart .
That bade repenting thoughts to melt ;
With sad ideals that ever come to naught .
The depth of private joy they feel ,
( misfortune justly suited to his brains )
Admittance free into my fortunes gain 'd ,
Yet still his dauntless worth , his virtue lived ,
The prospect made them glad ;
In naked feeling , and in aching pride ,
And a doctor that took the sum ;
And surly winter grimly flies ;
Within , a skeleton , its white skull crowned
With ruin the country on which it descends .
Where rail cars run at speed terrific ,
A threatening finger , while he made thee known ;
The chill that turns his warmest sighs
To where the rivulets of sweet water ran ;
Now let my happier foes possess my place ,
On the dark edges of each cloud that lies
Making nations nobler , freer .
The printed word to mirror robert greene .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze ;
With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night .
So high that all the virtues there did come ,
What future bliss he gives not thee to know ,
As though a tongueless nightingale should swell
That braver fires may tremble in his eyes ;
To breathe the air one winter -- had a room
In all his gentlest majesty displayed .
When his wound-wasted form was borne
Sweet hue of eastern sapphire , that was spread
He , whose transcendent wisdom passes all ,
That thi malice is overcome :
Shimmering in radiance that no words may tell !
And they dropped their plunder and took to flight .
Then the world turns and makes an admiring grimace .
It turns to slavery 's parish beadle ;
Whatever it creates and nature makes . "
And on their mourning soon black night had come ,
Your kingdom 's overthrow proclaims .
Pensive his godly state he keepeth thus .
Of birds that piped their valentines , and woke
Has the destroying angel passed the posts
It mingled strangely with my fears ,
With all which melteth duty in delight --
And cloud and sunset , drank the wild appeal ,
And to mark the sacred hour ,
Back to their wonted channels rolled ,
Simple as earth , forgetting song and bird .
There heaven-born freedom shall reside ,
Their hulls the tall and shifting surges hide .
But all my heart is drawn above ,
Clearly reveal that victory tree
Must grow familiar till no curse astound thee ,
To jenkins , who gave him a terrible look :
So he sought and got discharge ,
Where fortune bears no sway o'er things ,
What made the people kindly smile ,
And with eternal nuptials bound .
But anguish wrung the unweeting groan --
To greet the day . her lithe , brown curve
Was set in the crown of a stranger .
A heart it gives to thee ;
Quiet gliding ghosts to me of joy and woe ,
I see how folk live that hae riches ;
For his soul is still ; it preserves
To pour its whole song in one note and fails
As her soul passed to the silence .
To what low depths a submarine can go .
Till now , as night fell and they lay abreast
For the summer air to come ,
For the death that stalks in darkness , or the
And love lies low
Upon my heart there falls a peace ,
That reverend fear and trembling with it brought ,
An ocean broke upon thy strand ,
September comes in with the wind of the west
Wider , and louder still the thunders spread ,
Knew that the truth shall make us free .
I pass the story of the war , --
Its melancholy radiance sent :
While as the fly gives place unto the gnat )
Yet not less purely felt the flame --
Great blocks of wisdom , cut from past despair .
And all those beams contracted into one ,
With all the shrubs and trees it bore ,
The rising winds a ruffling gale afford ,
He received his early education at dartmouth college ,
The moon was clear , the day drew near ,
And falteringly the traitor plays his part .
Wilt thou the path of ruin tread ?
His faint heart trembling as he winds along ;
They feel the blessings of the golden mean ;
As a bowstring stretched to breaking :
And the flames shot up to heaven ,
But yet some saving counsel may we give ,
To put hire in hir fader grace ,
Follow a vision ; and the flowers and trees ,
The city yet must hear the roar
And in what pain and what distress it laid ,
Enough of these , go mad as barrett bays .
In flashing gold and high magnificence ,
Mine eyes along the line by which it passed ,
The western winds in time may bear it home
Equity reports shower fame ,
That purer kindness could not be displayed
To whose objection thus i make reply :
While every laughing rill that sprang
The trouble grew within her eyes ,
Where i dare not lift these eyes of mine .
Lonely it liveth its life in this place ,
My heart was singing like a happy bird ,
With fearful teeth , his chariot drew .
But stretched away unto the edge of doom .
This breast once shaken with the strife of care
Among the throng . his youth was fully blown ,
He rooted out the slothful officer
We laugh , but sobs are mixed with laughter ;
Nor grudge the hours that roll ;
Their tender husbands , and their passions cooled .
The marshalled armies sang farewell .
And i feel that my flesh is the slave
No mountain coolness to your cheeks shall bring ;
Kindly intercourse sprang , slowly unfolding its leaves ;
Their radiance earthward flung ;
Takes life , takes form from thee ;
In their unmonarched eyes says day is done
Has crossed the borders of the universe .
Above the city hangs a limpid glare ,
To all the fervor the boy 's heart feels --
Melts in the warmth of rich colour and fire .
Sad as the last which reddens over one
Like the eyes of wolves glared at them !
These feel keen affliction their consciences goad ,
A tenderness untried , to fit
The winds blew keen , the snow fell fast ,
Love makes them shine ,
The respectable hearse goes slowly by .
Approach and take , o glorious king ,
Flame as he tumbles , swept through empty air ,
And safe in port your gallant fleet shall lie ;
The sun sinks to the horizon .
" then did the quick pursue the dead
Where the old flotilla lay ,
Now dimmed and gone ,
When drooping pleasure turns to grief ,
Hot july brings cooling showers ,
The shadowed light of evening fell :
The virtuous ráma made reply :
Was not with dora . she broke out in praise
To give my careless thoughts a check , --
And never quarrels boiled his blood
That lay in the house that jack built .
Napping on guard , straightway resolved to make
A dull desire to rest deep midnight wrought ,
So after remaining one cold winter season ,
Save you through truth , and bring you liberty .
Is c ---- m zealous to support our laws .
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame ,
While , tumbling brown , the burn comes down ,
I am ashamed of having shed these tears ,
And secret loathing fell .
Crossing the waters ) doubt , and something dark ,
Our troubled age shall pass , as doth a day
Than the very death of passion lies .
The melancholy waters lie .
Or swelling mountains to obscure their shames .
Their rotting shapes struck terror . thus do men
Has met with hindrance on his desert way ,
So manhood comes -- and so it surely goes ,
And sweet the music was which hovered round ,
The red blood sing in the veins and melt
To take sure tidings and our chief recall .
Draw forth their arrows , and their aim prepare .
Long hours be borne , of chilling apathy ;
Amorous ditties serve for graces ,
The tear of regret was observed all around ,
Such made the dream he rushes to fulfil ! --
Wind wherein seas and stars are shaken
Safe upon the solid rock the ugly houses stand :
I knew one day that unsaid word would dress
The autumn of the third year came and went ;
Yet hope itself a brightness throws
Whose searching eyes encountered hers ,
Does it return his kisses ?
But came the waves and washed it away :
Transported touch ; here passion first i felt ,
I twined some faith , some trust ,
The moon shall lie in shivering , silver pools ,
Along the lines of radiance spun
Child , you 're running a long account
Where angry words were counted as a crime ;
Winging the vistas of infinity ,
First red as roses that on lawn we lay ,
To their own great land they are drawing nigh ,
That brought to us our good greenway .
The silent sunbeams through the window pour .
The grass is withered and the roses fade ,
Unsatisfied with what tradition taught .
As much of noon as i could take
But follow the joys that have flown ;
What dangers threaten them -- yet still they write :
Wreaths of smoke take shapes uncanny --
And find forgiveness where the shadows stir
He studies scripture , strives to sound the heart
The joys that in one torrent streamed .
Loveliness such as yours will not be lost ,
And now her hand is laid upon his heart .
As the boatman kept the feast-day ,
In various garb and guise the shadows came .
And faith may fail to scale its azure heights ;
That pours pale magic through the shadowy leaves ;
But that is left which life indeed assures --
There came hard arms and a panting kiss --
Keen as the ready knife her hand had sought ,
The flame which thus my life consumed ;
And over the forgotten place there clings
Of pallas following diomede incensed ,
_ rax _ , to stretch .
And gathering tears , and tremblings of distress ,
It makes me scratch my head .
Cold tears must fall upon the lonely field ,
That go on pilgrimage :
As sick man 's flesh is gone .
Bid it rise boldly at the signal given .
The leucadian cliff we follow ,
The brightening glow that comes with morning skies .
Old cotta shamed his fortune and his birth ,
What chalice life had offered us to drink ,
Hope shall change to glad fruition ,
And make love a burial-place .
My death brought down the house .
It gazes on those glazed eyes ,
The shower of moonlight falls as still and clear
There gently lay the roots , and there
Newly fledged , her visible song , a marvel ,
In our raised eyes there flashed a glow
Among the crowfoot tufts the river bore ,
And we hold in great affection
Such cute inventions sin will take in charge :
Love lies bleeding _ hopeless , not heartless . _
Such became phlegyas , in his gathered wrath .
Again the clouds their copious moisture lend ,
Which feeds the church with holy light .
We follow the feet where all souls meet ,
And whatever was lost could speedily bring .
It does n't take much to hold
Of the awfulness ranging without ,
Now they reach the home of ahti ,
What has life left to give
They menace our ranks : they break our line .
Torn from pelorus , or the shattered side
Of hope is passing in eclipse --
To ease his melancholy .
Scattering the clouds with a resistless smile ,
That can so far extend their fame .
The muse , nae poet ever fand her ,
So , fall the bravest of the christian name ,
And , to fill the soul with comfort ,
My soul hath seen their faces ,
What blessings thy free bounty gives ,
Give us weariless faith
While hearth flames danced in magic plays ,
But fill the hollow vale with joy !
" why stand ye idle , blossoms bright ,
And there was god , eternal life that sings
Of which i duly will the structure tell .
And shrines , to suit the holy shade ,
What time therein his hand thine image traced .
Desirous there his bloody course to run ;
To meet both victory and defeat ,
Above the storm our prayers we lift ,
The avenging storm of war , that laid
The snows of time fall o'er my brow ,
That make men 's souls their special traffic ,
Give me the old clue to follow ,
A tyrian light the village fills ;
Dead past succor of man he lay .
Which sister has planted , our spirits to cheer .
Rest and deep silence , in which are absorbed
Just how your happiness lies in her hand
Of breathing sculpture , oft has walked with thought ,
The song-seed , i sow it ,
In their base projects monarchs to maintain ? --
When thy lovers went heavily without heart , as men
Might have from time acquired some slight defect ;
Before the chiefs her glorious aegis bore ,
Taking god 's help , have attained to think
And he spoke the words which follow :
In those fair eyes where all perfections keep .
On the mat her hands lay idle ,
Her clear song followed on pinions afar ;
The gipsies ' smoke rose deadly pale ;
For the flag that floats to-day .
It passed so near his ancient head
Our hearts , whose high affections burn alone
Fell flashing , and her heart took thought to seize
Wit grew polite , and numbers learned to flow .
He hail 'd the rock , the lonely wild :
Sifts the warm harvest 's musky smell .
States , ( and many more to come , )
Ring out the feud of rich and poor ;
And break the silvern psalteries ! "
Their souls as yet had never bound
Though dull wits fail to follow . it was this
When i know that your system made her throw
That gorlois and king uther went to war :
And follow both the bridegroom ; so the bride
Where spices breathe , and brighter seasons smile ,
His great mare made the hoof-casts fly .
Leaving dull care behind ,
The voyage every soul shall make alone ,
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell .
Prepared to open all the fate of war .
There broke o'er me a thunder-clap ,
The old summer rears the new-born roses .
What even cromwell spared is desecrated
To give the marching columns room .
Love will make our cottage pleasant ,
The dog made a bow ,
Profanely took to fisticuffs !
Had left a bit of warmth for me --
Whilst these my feet go slowly fast .
And over my head the waves have met .
And fighting them , she thus made good amends
Himself to sing , and build the lofty rhyme .
At the first plunge the horse sunk low ,
Or cringing begs a crumb of praise ;
While khara , urged by valiant rage ,
Streaming with blood and gory , to the hilt :
An end had put unto his reasoning
Time , too elusive to hold . . .
Every night when the sun went down ,
Who hides , perhaps in her veil of sorrow ,
While better work did his own hands employ .
When fame would call me to her heights ,
His messengers : they bear the deadly taint
His grace made people think him slim ,
Who would set the mob aboon the throne ,
Voicing a sorrow we can ne'er express ,
The clouds pass , puffs of grey ,
Leading to the land of gladness ,
Still , though your wickedness must harrow
What follows ? vacant nothingness ?
Till all the rose-roots stirred .
Clear all the heaven that bends above
Which have taught him how to live .
In beauty ever matched with thine ;
He enlarged her borders and brought her fame .
And they made a molten image ,
That it receives whatever turns to it .
Far-called our navies melt away --
Young nymphs betray ; the rose 's hue ,
And the sword runs to kill the ass ,
My wedding day would last from now till christmas .
Who is the lord whose yoke they bore ?
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
When guilt itself a human tear might claim , --
The ransom 'd pay .
When the eastern conduits ran with wine .
Because he keepeth not the sabbath day !
Till back again he leads the smiling day ?
That fought around their king .
Remembrance of all woes he had brought on troy ,
Nor seeking any portion to withhold ,
Yet there is life he can not give .
Thy thirst , which from the triple question rose .
Life , and no pulse against it strove ,
Whereof they forged the brand excalibur ,
Too swiftly now the hours take flight !
The crocus cups hold flame .
Came the sadder , fainter cry ,
Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge .
Pure water from the stream they drew ,
Distinct ; joy fills the gazing shepherd 's heart .
You have drawn those deposits at least ?
And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
He laid his dreams upon my day ,
He sees and feels the awful load of sin ,
Nature slept in sweetest beauty ,
Than the smiles we scatter ,
The thick lids of night closed upon me
If perfect life possess your life all through
Better for thee no caesar had waged war ,
There was a pause before the answer came ,
About you clung the wild perfumes
And winter 's now come fairly .
To burn thee as the laws require .
Holds a strange influence o'er the human mind .
Young henry met the foe with pride ;
There came a wind like a bugle ;
To palestine the brothers took their way .
The shepherd be , to guide and govern all .
Than whom a better senator ne'er held
Until his pity moved in tune with hers
On force relied , and found it break :
Rainy days may come apace ,
His fastness in thy tomb , the weasel take
For that must be touching which shows
Great fame remained ; and ere it die away
Little bell gave each his honest share --
Depriv 'd of all comforts attending this life ;
A mild domestic pity kept its place ,
Revolving i should feel the dismal joustings .
Fragments into the void we carry ,
Bring life back again to me .
Council was held of life and death .
Desert the ships , and pour upon the plain .
A furious shout now raise the crowd ,
Her laughter stung as a whip might sting ;
That first " betty " said i was ashamed
Where , all who came , the pencil took ,
Moving her soul to find her soul , and passing
A vision back , since each thing comes to pass
To pass the hours in sorrow and in tears ,
It played inaudible melodies ,
The sisterhood of ocean thus address 'd .
But ever the strong man up and down would pass
And the old year has struck ,
For blows come quick when folks are so inclined :
What date does thanksgiving come on this year ?
Its counterfeit has perished . now unshamed
Till years bring back thy youth again .
Was brought his vengeful anger to suspend ;
How their merry quickstep played --
They shortly cast their anchor at spithead .
And babbled for the golden seal that hung
But , with that consciousness , there came
Their careless limbs diffus 'd supine ,
And the horses breathed and the field found fault ,
The shadow deepens down on the karroo .
Hate raised the dagger but love held it still .
Sang his song for three months running ,
Their 's not to make reply ,
Beneath each banner proud to stand ,
The efforts that marcus aurelius made for his improvement and
To whom he gives the prize of victory ,
Then from the inmost shrine there came a voice
A conscious slumber seems to take ,
When once 't is touched by sorrow 's tears
Month after month must find its doom :
Are dew-drops where twin heavens shine confessed ;
That tell how my heart is far away .
Finds a cold bed her only comfort left .
And it rang and surged within him ,
Then he found some work to give him ,
In the summer just passed over ,
And viscid mists rise in the west --
And it makes his heart rejoice .
Each morning sees hope proudly mount ,
If changing empires rose or fell ,
She shared with us the tears her conflict brought ,
It seemed that satan kept him from my way .
Like devils in grain peck away .
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given ,
Deeply has sunk the lesson thou hast given ,
Saw the signs of bad-luck lower ;
Pierced by three lances lay the courser strong ,
Nor could he make the hideous beldam speak .
Delay not : ere the western sky is hung
And there should come one moment
To her his plighted promise should maintain .
" who put the french to rout ;
That which humanity may bear , or bear not :
Then off there flung in smiling joy ,
Not a spar that comes to grief !
In the light cloud-shadows that slowly pass ,
I felt that something must be really wrong .
Give heaven the light of thine !
Mead along his blade was flowing ,
And there to rites austere apply ,
A star stood large and white awest ,
The queen of love did never move
A speedy beast as horses go .
Bare the letters to our king .
Of time was spent , before the earth did clung
They have faded away where the last dreams die ...
To see the end of all my gains ,
A clarity that gleams always .
And fills my eyes with tears ;
When great peril calls for action ,
It called on all to gather
In the summer just passed over ,
He rings the bell of fate .
There in the sight of men it lay ,
And the alphabet left to rest , that day .
And seeking faults in my reply ,
A thought is born -- of god in heaven .
For i am filled with perfect joy from it .
A god of death who will not spare .
Had caught its hue from night 's descending pall ;
But over a dream the past will hover ,
Take the leap that springs the need .
May be forgotten ; and the time may come
Hypocrisy , flattery , and who deals in magic ,
Ivon and ivor he found , laid low ,
In the trembling leaves of twilight trees ,
She smiled a smile that showed this style
If the first touch break the bowl ! --
Whether clear or filled with trouble . "
Another story on the rock imposed ;
You read her as a land distraught ,
But as flowers that fade and are grey ,
It made him take a knot !
And danced in words of lurid fire
I sought the city and the hopes it held :
And this new vow discharged more faithfully
And there before them ran the grey
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears .
A vision answering a faith unshaken ,
To thee our fragrant love we bring ,
Nor more defence the routed hands maintain ;
The love of eros ? cast away thy pain ,
His eyes with terror now stand open wide ;
Whispers clara , thrilled with terror .
The saint again this answer made :
I saw thy heart begin to melt ,
Dark clouds trail over the sky :
Flitting from shade to shade , wide eyes that stared
And draw their bills on banks above :
Whose heart was ever set to song , or stirred
It sufficeth the charm was set ;
The throbbing of her heart that seemed to fill
Sinking : " devil , stir thy fire !
To keep the world forever fresh and young ;
Which still of human form the marks retains .
Soon from his sway the realm will pass .
Through glastonbury street went they ;
She seems to pass with fall 's perfumes ,
Should i , myself , show my hot displeasure ,
For the silence made her afraid ;
And swiftly sink life 's ebbing sands ;
Though masks encloud their beauty ,
Rage makes a weapon of what comes to hand .
That made it stir on the shore .
You that have seen the joy of the spring ;
Where the rain may fall upon me ,
Why hast thou made this tarrying ?
Evermore threaded by a limpid fountain ,
Until our rights receive a blow ,
Where boneset blooms , with moisture bowed ;
That with his voice arise --
Waking the flowers to steal new sweets away :
The bird had flown , but the lesson stayed ,
A heaving sea of life , that beats
Now night had shed her silver dews around ,
And i 'll give thee a silver pound ,
Beats in upon my radiant grave .
" sweet , i come the golden way ,
To see a good landlord fresh pleasure must give ;
To hit the nerve of feebler sight .
To drive the cold winter away .
Nor let my throning rites proceed .
To hold an empire in his hands ;
No careless watch the monarch neptune kept :
Rebellion rising , saw in whom , how spred
Of gleaming bubbles wrought of beauty 's shell ?
What find you in that filmy gaze ?
Of ivy , bringing that which numbs .
Hath laid her babe to rest ;
Were the sweet flowers of purity , which gave
And guide my soul through the shadows of earth
The notes and illustrations that accompany mr. longfellow 's
He knew when it would blow or rain ,
And spread to his gaze this wondrous thing , --
The two fleets lay becalmed upon the silver
Can we but that counsel find .
But mirth is turned to melancholy ,
That drowned the summer musics of the earth .
Then on the couch his weary limbs he cast ;
As sounds that your chanter produces ;
On their tracks his eyes were fastened ,
Of equal faith , in glad estate is greeted .
Across the calm connecticut the hills change
Then fall unto your cheer ,
The billows come from the vast unknown --
And he looked to his strength for his prey .
Floating or rowing as our fancy led ,
Curse to the war that drinks their harmless blood .
One moment ; the dull pain hath left those eyes
Never tried by tax ,
Fu ' lifted up wi ' hebrew lore ,
When thither first the damsel took her way ;
When scarce his chirping bill had broke the shell .
Then fell the floods of heaven drowning the deep .
The awe that rests with midnight on the way ;
The grief of love can move ! "
In eternity -- we feel --
Are desolate where death his shroud has flung
An expressionless horizon stares with stone eyes .
The time of drinking tea comes on .
Was soon prepared for strife or storm .
And shed keen anguish o'er the heart :
But not the face her later gaze had known ;
A wicked whisper came , and made
A string of scholars went in fear
Of the white canopy was laid .
And it laid there a twenty-two carat
The shining goods needs must handle and try ,
His dearly bluvd lost oss again
And in his cell , when death drew near ,
Once more their sacrifice of praise ascended
And a hush falls for all acclaim .
Where hell 's capacious cauldron is set on :
_ where fortune bears no sway o'er things ,
From labour could not wean them ,
Hence among these i go with downcast front . "
And as the firelight fell ,
Like a rich tint that makes a picture warm ,
O wind that bloweth from the west ,
And madness rave , and malice take her aim :
Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark ,
Shall meet one atom that was you .
The young year sets the buds astir ,
But the cheerful spring came kindly on ,
And gold locks floating from moony brows .
All they are stalled and folded for their rest ,
And darkness closes o'er the scene ,
That gave my lover scorn . ”
The wind that chanced to blow that day
To lonely hamlet and to stirring town ,
And then it winnowed the elysian air
Then let revenge no longer bear the sway ;
To these fond eyes restore thy welcome sails !
And earning money there to take the trip .
The patriot 's voice , to teach and rouse ,
And , when at last they reached the strand ,
Now of things appertaining to his case ;
But all the place a cheerless aspect wears ;
Grief dares to mingle her soul-piercing voice ,
Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies .
How tenderly the moon doth fill the night !
Pines for a fullness which it finds not here ,
Till , finding his legs were beginning to tire ,
Our blood and brain washed clean ,
And mixes purple mists with light ,
At last came graduation ; brown received
To own your poet , and regard his strain ?
He held the thunder . but the monarch owes
And its mighty shadow falls deep and wide ,
To meet that frown , he shrunk to do .
The glory that abideth near our throne .
Mark how the star , at eve that rose ,
Then the young spring , with winged zephyr , leads
So the river rose and found him
They give and suffer worlds of pain .
And bonfires make all day ;
Her steps ; and one that came too late forever
Then her people , softly treading ,
It would wring tears from a statue .
Was santiago doomed . his chance had come ;
Now to the ramparts they have found their way ,
I take her for the flower of womankind ,
Across his brother 's arm . love could not quell
And that no medicine could give relief ;
The winding sheet of edward 's race :
What the winter rude hath taken .
So wholly my prayer filled me : till i felt
But first the landlord will i trace ;
That must new fortunes try , like turtle doves
His gospel shall be spread ! "
Slowly the three months dragged : no michael came .
And christmas bring his melancholy :
The snowy clouds , soft sleeping lambkins , lie
Though i own that my heart has been ranging ,
The sun rode high in a cloudless sky
The lovely virgin , ere awake , they chain :
While dropped his tears of pity warm ,
And happiness to all doth bring .
The rest all fought , and dread the shouts arose
Till the daylight slept ; and i wailed and wept
What led thee to so dire a place ?
Of life and death my heart has drunken up !
The pale which held that lovely deer :
In some forgotten life , long time gone by .
Comes the title to the present .
Shake the air where our banner floats ;
With mind made up ( or primed with gin )
What , within sacred ring , secretive image concealed .
Spirits , who came loud wailing , hurried on
These , no common pains you 're taking .
Give the fir-trees shining silver ,
With all their terrors came . in dense array
To mix the bitterness of earth with heaven ,
" these titles false serve thee for no protection ,
Has laid upon me , to oppose thy rage .
Round the dear object it has loved so long ,
The full particulars , and gladly lends
The wondrous boat scant touched the troubled main
How the sounds tremble ! how they thrill !
Were keeping the music 's time .
Brings in the same infernal rabbi ,
It fills our eyes with light ,
Light lay the earth on billy 's breast ,
“ in doubt and fear long years have passed
O sacred essence , lighting me this hour ,
To fill with happiness our lives ;
In one short sentence take my whole advice ,
And feel he wants that valor great of thine ,
Great absolution gave .
Parting the pair , as we may well suppose .
The speedy gleams the darkness swallow 'd ;
My heart gives you love .
Hath locked up mortal sense , then listen i
And draw the damned ghosts from limbo lake ,
It only shows us where we strayed :
When my dear country shall be made
Then swelled her bosom with maternal pride
That stirred the boughs of the sleeping trees ,
Years , years fleeted over --
With the comical things he on earth had found .
But in their stead rich , waving grain ,
Five scymitars , wi ' murder crusted ;
And that remaining sage , to follow her .
“ in folly , king , he loves to lay
Gone with them , and quenched in their grave !
" and an extended region rise at last ; _
He instantly recalled the name ,
There gently lay the roots , and there
The sweet , sweet singing died sadly away ,
But when the sun went down and darkness fell ,
And reach its goal .
But since , methinks , it shows
Will blossom here ; spread all her faculties
Joy that can say to death ,
But one lifts a face of clayish pallor ,
What but the space that lies between
All those startled figures show ,
Shall find his avarice there and cowardice ;
We may not know how fared your soul before
Nor on his eyes that night had slumber sat ,
Bringing home their true loves
Pale old winter has made his retreat .
Of all the plagues a lover bears ,
Till to your very doors the war be brought ?
And the sword the hero suited .
That in his bosome lies :
To show that victory was ours of right .
Still run on poets in a raging vein ,
Who can lay hold upon my words ? give heed
The voice of memory , that stills to stone
Our proffered love hath ventured to disown ,
He gives me such a bold and curious look ,
But gentle rains came in october ,
The springs of memory , that feed alike
As land-wind breaks the lines of dying foam
Opened their bills in complaining .
It is appointed that all kings see hell .
A planet sang , and the air breathed musk .
Thy likeness takes when shines the streaming moon .
But hope inspired by faith will guide to heaven !
The very streams reflect the hues ,
To make and store up happiness ,
Tears newly shed , and scarcely dried :
And high flying could follow you .
No mercy will be offered ,
He followed in my host to spain ;
Money is impudent , and will prevail .
That came in neptune 's plea ;
Task set about . hooded and cloaked , she slid
“ through which the sad procession took its way ,
It breaks for love of thee ,
And bring us triumph in the end .
Then truth is near to find ;
That not without a power which comes from heaven
Beyond the clouds that rest upon the grave .
Because already was my speech prepared :
That my hunting hath brought me .
And as all sprang with one accord to win
From pictured heights of power and lost renown ,
But the dreams depart , and the vision falls ,
To hang the proud horizon in our home .
The creeping tide came up along the sand ,
Flesh of his flesh , unsparing , passed
For thus his promise reads .
Yet such arrangement , rarely brought to pass
Where satan tempts and angels come to shield ,
It makes no odds to him ;
No glimpse of joy beyond makes horror less .
Then dared we follow the dark way they trod ,
And then he made reply :
Then her people , softly treading ,
He gave the different nations something national ;
The piper 's face fell , and he cried ,
Our hearts are inclined ;
And likewise what 's gone of the established church ?
There faith shall come , a pilgrim gray ,
Answered in the words which follow :
From the white part come the moonbeams ,
To which a mournful answer made the queen :
Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share ;
No child has he to raise his hope , --
The glorious hermit made reply :
Ripe for their plot were met ; the spacious hall
Or hasty judger would have called her guilt ,
It is that thou hast made my life too sweet
The sight of that young crescent brings
And soft as a leaf that swings and hovers ,
And his soul at its parting shall tremble not ,
I asked if it made him happy or miserable .
Within that place would hold a splendid court ;
Who might avert the mischiefs that he feels .
Once gained by penance long and hard .
Fast by the road a precipice was worn :
Was reined in by achilles ' mighty son :
Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood ,
Till it touched the top of heaven ,
Decay had touched the features of the slain
No longer now the seasons wear
O give us hearts to love like thee ,
His cupboard was empty and winter was come .
They to the sea . and tender music made
And i blushed for the world we 'd made ,
Can give , and what retract a grace ;
The nerves of boyhood strung !
Yet stained , misused , brought sin and shame
That lifted each a trembling flame to make
Yet when this fiery web is spun ,
That all unknown in the scriptures lay .
And we give you deathless fame .
His envious heart with indignation swell ’d .
That i discover napping . '
An anniversary that wakes
Their murmurs grew to shouts of praise .
" his aid denied , more deadly symptoms came ,
If i were put to write a new religion --
Came tragic ; passion not to be subdued ,
Where , over valleys hanging in the clouds ,
The dimples played within your cheek ,
Again revive to life ; may leaves of hope
Call down the holy trinity to bless
Must i from both with coldness meet alone ?
Some share of thy strength thou hast given
The posy with a smile he gave ;
Like huge green shadows crowned with ghostly snow
I see your dear eyes shine ,
No sound made answer save the cries of grief
Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish 'd me ;
The path of truth he never leaves ,
Would feel his stout heart strangely beat --
Sir elvar took his lonely way ;
To warm his soul at her old altar fires ,
She 'd squander money much against my will ,
Day dawning upon christendom . the light ,
Which virtue , wealth , and joy produce .
That promised joy which brightens all beneath ,
The camp around in slumber lies ;
To the shades of oblivion must certainly sneak ;
When our two souls stand up erect and strong ,
True love , long sought and found at last ,
Henceforth can bring me anguish
Night fell . i heard his tread ,
And made that music which was noise before .
Yet he his bright axe took again with vigor .
And cast the dark foundations deep ,
Beneath castilia 's sword his monarch lay ;
The year 's four changing seasons brought
Nor greater panic seized upon those swarms ,
This earth that wears upon her
The love that is based on attraction of sex
The courts of old atlantis rose .
So young , scarce learned to stand --
The wind that rises at the dead of night
This life my sins with wretchedness make rife ,
Her evening prayer with folded hands must whisper ,
To do and keep my life . to finish up
Through golden skies advancing up his head ,
How it chanced that i escaped
And the admiral to shameful slaughter put ! "
Death through his senses and his visage ran :
The unwise award to lodge it in the towers ,
Spirits breathe a finer air ,
Nor from those appetites sustain 'd annoy ,
Conceals the castaly which shakespeare sought .
Wistful eyes she turned to heaven ;
So that my sight went little in advance ;
The fortunes of the spot must hold in store
All my debts i fully settled ,
And the soul in it speaks and sings ,
Homeless and sobbing through the deep she goes .
As battle-glorious kings , who have brought low
The icy tempest stung my brow :
To the high dreams we held within .
Ring out the grief that saps the mind ,
For well he knew protected by her smile ,
Of passion , like a tiger 's , slowly crept
O'er the memories they have left ?
The thundering bully may rage ,
He 'd broke his gig and spoilt his mare ,
It turns my darkest night to day ;
He delivered his secrets to the riven multitude .
But more like a volume its actions appear ,
Is comfort found , nor any pleasant cheer .
Moving forever , the sum yet seems to stand
Before the sun could gild the trees
I summon up remembrance of things past ,
" there is a star that runs very fast ,
Lest its former powers shall weaken ;
Lay the proud usurpers low !
What time the ample summer warms the glade ,
Then happy ; no unbounded hope had raised
While to her song a thousand echoes call ,
But now , alas ! the fatal hour arrives
E'en such is this bad world we see ,
Then shared the tyranny , then lent it aid ,
The shore they cover , now the oarsmen sweep
And when his anger tare him , massacring
My trembling tongue no words could frame .
And , his eyes pleading ere his terrors spoke ,
And little stars shot from their fixed places ,
And thus to mind old friends and pleasures bringing ;
Are caught by another blast that whirlwind-like
But in an inner court , securely closed ,
That flows in the veins of the wealthy .
And vengeance fed its torch from wrong ?
The sun sat shining without sound .
Which runs through all , connecting race with race
Still doth the file of hebrew dames proceed .
Now different ways our fates compel ?
From whence come such unto the written word
And drifts till no traces remain ,
Would set you up in business .
_ they _ spent the night in solemn contemplation
I follow till i make thee mine . '
Here comes another family scene at somersby .
Prayer falls in rain to make broad rivers run
Hurled and hidden , and buried light
Or the heart will melt in tears ,
Caught from his signals as the train flashed by ;
That to my will gave wings ; and i began
A shepherd in a shade his plaining made
My soul can reach , when feeling out of sight
Old occleve turned to lion . lion moved
For africa , where camped the christians lie ,
Of borrow ( unless foresight cheat me here )
Mist-clouds sailing on their way
Till age and death shall gently call thee hence ,
Of steps had worn a way . not verdant there
Their pulses come ,
O what a sky has walked the world !
The choice of all my treasures take ,
The bells were silent , not an echo stirred .
Oh ! not where the world its vigil keeps :
And one long rolling fire of triumph run
Come away , ere night is gone !
As with the darker waves averse they blend .
And though my father 's mansion stood secrete ,
Which binds the white scroll gleaming from the wing ,
I see the flame of freedom burn , --
Now has lost its hundred branches ,
Better times are now approaching
Accursed , and the city lost in sand :
For the day that gives her to the sea
With sweet content that eve they drew their breath ,
It made my soul afraid .
Which veins of sanguine ore displayed ,
Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure .
Then came the turn of the least daughter ,
That we take thy hide an hour ,
The same mild season gives the blooms to blow ,
The waters wild went o'er his child , --
A thousand graces masking in delight ;
But yet a small voice whispered :
Thy ken directed to the point , whereat
Uttered keen howls that smote the echoing hills .
Borrowed a star to show him light !
And now in our thrilling hearts we hold
Sweet danger found him in the devious ways .
" her eyes are sapphires set in snow ,
She sat the long night through and wept ,
My long dependence in an hour is lost .
It burns my heart i must depart ,
Burst from each pyramid expiring groans ,
Pursuers of a film they hailed ideal ;
That humor interposed too often makes ;
Where the sky seems close and the drifting clouds
Filled with a sweetness born of happier spheres ,
His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely ,
Give my hero joyful greetings . "
Give credit to his grief . deep in their breasts
In my court the morning 's twilight found me ;
Kauppi gave this prompt decision :
When the impregnate air retains the thread ,
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow ,
Was darkest , and its deepest shadows threw ,
And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts ,
And broke the forest-boughs that threw
The shadows of those shades that go .
That every hour thy heart runs wild
My sorrow asks no healing ; it is love ;
Supposed too fast this tree of virtue grew ,
Since end must be what matter how it come ?
And make atonement for thy sin .
Bring surcease to her strife ,
" till to the house by his admirers borne ,
To ráma gives the power and might .
What quiet watch she seems to keep ,
There is who heeds , who holds them all
His life had ventured . dreams he in his pride
While one new tear arose in haidee 's eye .
The morning wind strikes chilly where it fell .
And fanned the transports of the fire .
Gone to make a bright new day .
And passion 's ever raging storm ,
But from the present strife we stand aloof ,
The kind soul lets her have her way !
It made me think of every flower i knew ;
Some weed with flossy blossoms will surprise ,
England , in this great fight to which you go
Came the wild macgregor 's clan-call ,
The earth brings forth its grain ;
When the fight below was raging ,
Then , with but paltry trouble led along ...
Their old one was sold and broken ;
Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill .
Yet those in daily converse see no change
The last embrace the bravest worst can bear :
To which you directed your wandering noses ,
So when this change the eunuch made
I craved what the world never gave ;
In her eyes brought the laughter of heaven .
Her robe of innocence was gone ;
The same old rut would deepen year by year ;
Where liberty was laid the corner-stone ,
While untamo goes unpunished ,
When ráma thus had made reply
And all lay slumbering in the dusky bower ,
Which she with cursed hands had shed before ;
And with rich metall loaded every rifte ,
More lands than france will obligation owe .
That which was cold shall take fire ,
And all her trouble made him easier prey .
The end lies ever in my thought ;
The languid hours pass .
Breath of perfume exhaled from her presence , and made
Oft in life saw this umbrageous elm ,
Dark moral knots , that pose the seer ,
A pool where echoes fall asleep .
With a passion that shook his soul --
Hang as if clinging to a cloud that still
About us stretches wealth of land ,
The night that covers and the lights that fade ,
Love turns aside the balls that round me fly ,
Deep look within his eyes i shrank in fear ,
To heal the wounds that italy have slain ,
Then peter set up such a yell ! --
Down to timur 's council went he ,
I felt that i had almost sinned .
Needing repose ; ambrosial night came on ,
In words like these good counsel gave :
But with severest toil maintained .
That foot that comes so soft at night !
As venomed snakes to burn and pierce .
All bliss the world can give insures . "
He spent himself , the labour of his axe ,
In impious singles bear the thorny wreaths :
" a way now to save you i see ;
Concentring the charms we should never dispart ,
Making my prayer to god ;
To follow whom , escaping sarza 's peer ,
Heaven 's instrument ordained to teach integrity .
Replenishment , which nature always sends ,
As the swift seasons roll !
The eagles floated , struggling with the wind .
Gives title to the worthier throne ;
Through thick leaves rifted fitfully ,
Intends to pass triumphant , and give laws .
The ten-cent public gave a roar ,
What fortunes on your steps attend . "
Wretched man , whose years are spent
All filled with vague and nameless longings , found
The breeze blew warm upon the flowering shoot ,
Whom death deliver 'd from the foes ' embrace !
Are given by gentlemen who teach to dance :
Some chamber flushed with wine and fire ,
And all alone went she .
Should never gain from him an equal love ;
When fitch 's comedies have all gone past ,
Of her canst give me information ?
The victory 's news to the maiden came --
When thee the injured nations forth shall drive ?
Marlowe hurled forth huge stars to make them crown ;
Upon the sun 's own face strange colours stray ;
Ocean and tethys their old empire keep ,
Then age comes on ! to habit we
May their familiars grow to shun their name ,
Gloomy death had sealed thine eyes ,
Loud rang the emptied beakers as he mused ,
Since it has made their lewdest priest relent .
And the wild , gentle thoughts that dwell
And learnt to warble when the days were warm
Some shaggy weeds that floated on the swelling tide .
And courage , which in that wild man appear .
Still i catch the scent of the rose
The call to arms brought sudden gaiety .
The spring colours just open to their full .
But right or left as strikes the player goes ;
Where streams allay her dust and heat .
Is resurrection . every buried thought
The streets encumbered with the slain . ”
When you of the precious old homestead took leave ;
And how they come , and how they pass ;
Should easier make a new campaign .
As many have found to their pain .
And came at last to england 's farthest strand .
All proud and stern his spirit rose ;
Their care upon the bank had spread .
And turning to their monarch fled .
It makes me love him better than a brother .
Shall safety to italia 's plains arise ,
That moves round its orbit of masses ,
Turned the round real world , his iron vice ;
The rich folks ' motors honked and flew .
Deeper within than words could reach .
Thus cull a favor which shall never fall ;
As merry as times would allow ,
The soft remembrance which still in it dwells :
Amongst those friends she most regarded .
Warm lie the yellow beams of moon ;
And in his lungs set fast the quivering spear .
-- that only serves to make us grieve
To both appeared so costly , rose a cry
Nor plucked green pleasures till the sun and rains
His bosom of its joy relieved . --
Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on .
No ripple reached the surface from the fair
Which followed up their wild retreat --
The tongues they cast upon the fragrant flame ,
And my heart it stounds wi ' anguish ,
The first that touch ’d the unhappy trojan shore :
Although my life is left so dim ,
Pointing its finger at her festering state ,
Give to the winds thy battle hymn ,
So sweetly , or thine eyelids leave so clear
It called her at dawn
To torturous grief and penance , that assailed
My blood is poured in the dust ,
The thought of thee is what the four winds bring
Again for britain 's wrongs they feel ,
His faith shall not fail us ;
Up a small height this while their journey lay ,
Here where dead nights sit grimmest
Steeped in sunshine , drenched in dew ,
There went a thin voice piping airs
My spirit seems in heaven to stay ;
No tidings good their billows roll ;
Choked in the bitter net that binds the skies ,
And , in the furious inquest that it makes
( for a nation bearing the battle 's brunt --
The game of old goes on , has only changed
And many a tiger makes his home .
His eyeballs , stabbed with bitter anguish , throbbed
From the gyres of change goes ever afar
With blue-veined fingers clutching the red fronds
The rattling quiver sound : thus speeding clouds
But with my numbers mix my sighs :
Then flashed into wild tears , and rose again ,
But before it knew bereavement ,
Where they may broadly run ;
Beneath her daisies lying .
I roamed where’er my fancy led ,
And every day it came to pass ,
Then , brandishing the mace he bore ,
Thitherward my heart is turning .
Take voice in whisperings that rise and pass ;
Forth flowed a stream of blood along the grass ;
Success is counted sweetest
Until it reached a splashing fountain 's side
That every hyacinth the garden wears
To a high chamber , hung with mourning sad ,
Nor love , whose anguish only learned to last .
The red light fell about their knees
The joy of life surrounded death .
There came no friend to his relief .
Like to the grass that 's newly sprung ,
Though the heart here hidden is
But with its sound it shook the sails ,
Its advertising brought us such renown ,
And so shalt thou discharge thy conseyence .
A temple where angelic love might dwell .
This gives you a safe pint to rest on ,
Hoped for better times to follow ;
Heaven 's pathways , if to thee they led !
Many long years to come , and this fair hair
The fleet of death rose all around .
And bliss his rod attends .
Thy sacrificial wine we press ;
And lupin sour , whose brittle stalks arise ,
Fleeting years of time have sped -- hurried by -
Laughing , rainbow-gifts forth flashing ,
The hypocrite brought his own soul , safe from reach
The crowd are pointing at the thing forlorn ,
Foul language at the elder throw ;
To wished end , part left to other days ,
To make fit honour to my shade redound ,
The blithe wind can not rest ,
Or upward ragged precipices flit
He modest merit sought to find ,
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you .
Giving him sight whose sight it takes away ?
Into the being of deeds made whole .
Calling to arms more warriors for the west ,
Again the gibe of scurril laughter rung ,
They held their pilgrim way .
Then i held my breath with fear and dread
When severn down to buildwas ran
And storm-clouds gather from the westward sea .
Kept watch , waiting decision , made reply .
As a dewfall felt from above ,
Thy very smile sends sadness to my heart .
New love with those sweet accents came .
Nor find i freshness in the dewy field ;
The thrush he holds to the woodland bound ,
The people wondered why he sought the office .
It touched a brilliant speaking tongue ;
And the grim rock puts on familiar looks .
My buried flesh should have directed thee .
And to augustus they so spread the flame ,
Alternately their shifting hands they plied .
The stains that war hath wrought upon the land
Where feet have gone up and down ,
Followed as fast as a horse could fly ,
What mean his twenty years to him ?
The beggar brings a song as offering
The fragrant snow-drifts flung upon the breeze ;
At each fierce onset met their fate ,
And liberty 's sunlight is beaming ,
Which like diamonds filled her dark lashes ,
Left here unguarded while thy limbs were given ,
The path that strikes as thro ' a sunlit haze
The moment , till too late to come again .
Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne ,
No darkness could his valor 's daylight stain ,
Wilt give me strength within .
He grants the circus warrant to take place
To gain it , men have shown
Is conscious of approaching death ;
His form assumed , the sacred dream began .
Faustus , who vainly would apply relief ,
Thy bright , brief day knew no decline --
Than all the centuries left behind ,
His keen eyes flashed with wrathful fire ,
If thou shouldst greater scruples show .
And felt her magic lore ;
Why of the heritage no portion came
A burst of laughter echoed through the shore .
“ how have ye dared my sleep to break ?
Flooding their minds , filling their hearts ; around ,
Have swallowed this morning , to balance the bliss ,
Those spells , which make us oft forget
Which makes me for to weep .
While the silver clouds went by !
The mind from feeling the alarm ,
Gathering swift kisses , touching breasts that leap ,
My darling , dost thou feel with me
It raves , made hoarse with desire ,
A cup she gave him , with kindly greeting
Where not a tree can feel the summer wind ,
The year lies fallen and faded
In many a case that shows a broken heart .
Better to find her soul , as plato says .
That it would make thee see
Men may be foes but beauty makes us friends .
The spring came to this street with spinning tops ,
Not broken by the ache of love -- i go
That bending forward , stretched
Touched by the kiss of the city ,
Returned each kiss i gave her loving ,
Makes three strong roots creep around it ;
And show no duller splendor ?
Like a river alive with fishes ran ;
So fresh they rose in shadowed swells ;
Wisely preserves alive the game first caught ,
The critic else proceeds without remorse ,
Grieving , my mind will be employed --
Like waves that follow o'er the sea ,
Somehow suggest old times and reverenced lands .
Where tired feet now stray ;
But say , what hero shall sustain that task ?
Fond fancy 's eye recalls the form divine ,
And nymphs immured find no release :
But , if it wait for winter 's breeze ,
The day is coming when all things ,
She put the glory of a golden mist ,
She hears beat the upper night .
Love , while the sweet thing laughs and lies ,
And thine hands were as arrows to scatter
He gave the popular chiefs the word ,
Michael has fought our battles ; raphael sung
These salt hands holding sweetness , the leader led ,
Her eyebrows in the willow he can trace ,
And hast thou neither shame nor reason left ?
A veil of moss the angel throws ,
He sette in love bothe tuo
The monarch ’s scale stood high .
In that grim battle-order . beacons flared
He spoke , and as the big tears fell ,
We fell out , my wife and i ,
Where things decayed and loved ones lost
How the winds rise and cease !
If they would free them of grief that sears ,
Her hand soft touching , whispered thus . awake ,
They view their hands for labor made ,
Or hear the plaintive cry of one that breaks ,
The world is his who takes his toll ,
Unless her paleness might be viewed as such ;
Had kept a strict regard for truth ,
There flows from her spirit such love and delight ,
As the months and years sped onward ;
His beggar 's wisdom only sees
Fire in every vein is coursing .
And catch the burning sparks that fly
Then khara ’s eyes with wrath glowed red ,
Before one charm or hope had taken wing .
The place that my once eager heart shall lack ,
Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little .
The sylphs behold it kindling as it flies ,
A pure devotion we may see ;
Nearer the field of fight her beauties bore .
Had kept me from youth and through manhood till lately
It fells the timid with the bold ;
If the same star our fates together bind ,
But generations go and come ,
Which scipio the heir of glory made ,
Who could a tower upon his neck convey .
It was not put there as a pious charm
The triumph already sweeps marching in song .
And fixed in ráma ’s brows a flight
' the blossom opening to the day ,
Unto him as he spoke ; fresh colour came
To feel the spirit 's restless aching ,
The romish faith she would restore .
And , with his veterans , made the attack ,
Like a tried old friend it comes to me ,
An ’ a tear stood in her ee ;
That homicide is set alofte
His father saw , and with a proud content
To wrap the smiling scene in darker woe .
Start into light , and make the lighter start ;
To proffer kindness , amid compute
And o’er his heart came sudden dread ,
And one who shapes an age while he endures
And humble virtue gets it in the neck .
And the air is filled that she passes through
And women 's wailing rends the air .
Each finds a place in history 's page ,
If venus yet had got his nose off ;
We 'll go to meet the dawning ,
Count them thy sisters and brothers that meet thee ;
And the fist oft clinches tightly .
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
That it makes one weary to hear . '
I lay my hands , in spirit ,
That one is missing from our heaven .
I was at college when death 's summons came ,
And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth
Through sorrow 's depths i here would wade
And hence thy surname grew . i follow 'd then
Of worlds that sing around the throne of god .
Silence winds about the dead ,
Entirely see the joke .
And came into my mind this act of heaven ,
And she dropped me a curtsey .
I knew that no firm thing they 'd catch .
Names to countries gives he , -- cities
And the waves can never thrust us back
The happy lovers rested in delight .
I felt the blackness come and go ,
Needing not us , they are not touched by wrath
According as they come . '
Thou shadow of a shadow that departs
When in the fog the rhone runs grey ,
Is there a heart that music can not melt ?
One proud glance of triumph the fugitive threw
The porter ready answer made , --
To their challenge made no answer ,
" the mountains lay in calm repose
Thus bathed their souls in summer 's sultry tide
Putting forth his manly efforts .
The placid pastures of the marshes lie .
The showy smile of young presumption plays ,
Over the future shed their sunniest beam ,
Moping we sit , in silent sorrow drown 'd ;
The figures hunched with pain ,
As with a lulling sound the fountain flows ,
The greater blessedness preserves the more .
And feel the fervor of your faith prevail !
He could only find the utterance :
The flesh tint peeping through .
A moment kindled , but as soon expired .
Will now all be turned into weeping for thee .
That turned so slow and sad to you ,
The tree-tops tossed with a ceaseless song :
Lang may she stand to prop the land ,
Gabriel , and michael , and him who made
Where stood last evening she and i -
And that alone pursue which fortune brings ,
Summer again is come !
_ his _ pledge , comes back to thee !
The cross on golgotha can never save
And i kept time to the wondrous chime ,
The battle join 'd , the foe gave way ,
And meets the soul of wordsworth , in profound
But all of the things that belong to the day
Bodies that bowed beneath christ 's own load ,
To-night shall turn to wine .
't was pity nature brought you forth
And cowering foes shall shrink beneath
His parchments channelled by the bookworm ,
Sends the fever from the marshes ,
Where the tortured trumpets scream aloud
Sat silent , by his woe oppressed .
The horses took fright , every one .
That feels no native bias ; never gains
And made me happy with my treasure .
Nor of thy birth the truth did ever tell ,
Ring out the false , ring in the true .
Conception unconfined wants wings to reach him :
Danced merrily , and sought her in the dance ,
Sad and compassionate to weeping make me .
Rage makes a weapon of what comes to hand .
And neither gives increase , nor brings decay .
The winds that toss 'd thy waves and blew
A cleanness made by me .
Follow a shadow , it still flies you ;
Like the fairest , for it folds thee
With nonsense to be filling her ;
Your memory woven about the beautiful things of life .
Their homes that bids them fro
Spring stirred and broke . the rooks once more
Has softened and has swayed the mind
At last might frame a chime so sweet
Which once too ripe will never rise ,
The hermits sought my side , the chief
Where the dove resting hid the thorns of fame .
See her , on golden dunes where shadows flit ,
Yet safe he sails ; the powers celestial give
Nor owned a sensual wish , to him the wall
And the soft sinews form the supple knee ,
And birds take places overhead ,
Was full of dreams that beckoned , reaching hands ,
Lean on no mortal , love , and serve ;
This little wand of fine gold take as well ,
Babes for the last time closing lips on breasts .
Where trailed the crimson creeper , serpentine ,
Had force to strike his foe with fear ,
What means thy hasty flight ?
Content with those the trojan hero gave :
Crowning the winter of my loneliness .
And thy stiff limbs may decently compose .
" thither i go to take my nap
And squander here stored-up celestial bliss
The wind will blow the quite contrary way .
Have turned to sleep in waxen cells ,
No pardon comes for those who wrongly read
" but churches for most part make choice of him
Before her ran an influence fleet ,
And merchandise ' whole genus take their birth :
Love prompted to the bridegroom 's tongue .
That goes without the beard .
Is to the circus led , and firmly bound ;
Truth , truth only , should stand and say ,
The listening woods received this song .
The faltering echoes come ,
That ever sat upon a persian throne .
Turns added beauty , like the veins that run
When trouble comes , these are your gods ,
Sweet tears the clouds lean down and give .
And add new horror to the realms of woe ;
The golden acorn lay ;
Then the great lord cardinal called for his book ,
His eyes , then fixed them on the ground ,
Would find so many faults in me ? "
And the blackbird renewing his song .
And your hope lies in a tomb ,
You took my dreams and made them true .
And silence held the babbling wakened town .
Rugged teamsters draw the rein ,
But taken from me was this drowsiness
Oh give me neither love nor tears ,
On piety , humanity is built ;
Of violent anger flashed across the face
Here naught but winds can hurtful murmurs scatter ,
The statesman stand apart ,
To take the world for a throne .
He looks upon no future : luther did .
And every pulse kept time ? suddenly there shone
Where each thing gets its start in moving on .
Answered in the words which follow :
We saw thine eyes break from their east
" before the romans lit the land ,
Where the froth-whispers of its waves emerge
Whereof the skilled musicians made a song .
No more of him the story tells ;
For half a century have beat ;
Thither all their bounties bring .
With the foam and torn features of wrath ,
For her the seas their pearls reveal ;
It speaks of war not peace ;
The writing must be letters maim 'd , that speak
Of english wrongs received from the red hands
The tumult and the shouting dies --
All claiming unction from the prophet 's shade ,
From darkness , and confusion , took their birth ;
Is one whose love and courage stir for thee ;
Thy life with very emptiness is bowed .
The faithful steps it will securely lead .
No wings will grow upon my changeless wealth ;
Sped on the wings of passion , striving on
Bearing miasma in its scorching breath ,
There the hushed winds their sabbath keep ,
Panting they stood ; and a judas sold
And generations pass , as they have passed ,
" too late ! " its mournful echo sighed ,
Quits all the calm that nature meant for man
His lids just opened to find how matters were ,
I trow it made me proud ;
Nor ever wind blows loudly ; but it lies
To meet the wild embraces of the wood ;
So the long days went slowly drifting past ;
I , too , shall reach home and rest ;
There shines the face i have not seen ,
Nor hath she ever chanced to know
Our hearts stood still when we heard him cry ;
And a high saint in heaven was made ,
That gave it birth , and kept it warm .
As clouds with clouds embrace .
She sheds no blood to that vain god of strife
To raise a poet 's fancy and his fire ,
And he and his jock took a header .
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt ,
Upon thy head noon 's fiery splendors heaping ;
And rivers and springs would summon them of old
The stars sang in their spheres .
Sudden anguish bound my spirit ,
As if the corpse they keep were oozing through --
There , when the snows about us drift ,
He erected for his soul ’s salvation ;
Couldst thou , when summer hours are fled ,
And read the only hints that yet remain .
All hearts with hope and newer courage fills ;
Amidst them all -- but now the shadows move
Could never touch the thrilling notes
Only , with me , the bonds that flew ,
" whither goes my son , my dearest ,
Those joys that love alone can give .
Pure joys these winter nights around me lie ;
The book with the poem lay .
This heaven in it doth bind .
Dim drifting shapes of fear and wrath .
Only prayer breaks the silence of the shrine
And find , in adoration , endless joy !
Is spread the shining water , all at once ,
Rapine has yet took nought from me ;
And found substantial bliss in vexing .
Loud uproar hence , and rage of arms arose ,
As the rapt seraph that adores and burns .
Love makes those young whom age doth chill ,
Like those above ; exploding other joys ?
Her home -- each flower that breathed there ,
All roads that lead to god are good .
Lest they should break the compact they had made .
Loaded with loud lament the lonely gale ,
I faltered , taking up the word :
Yet often when musing they float back to me ,
' but now let other themes our care engage .
The azure waters , leaves him there ,
That leads to heavenly bliss ,
O how i know , and feel , and recognise
Will take the malady from them they tend ,
_ so many times over comes summer again _ .
Not rest and not oblivion i found .
The servant , who hath joyful tidings brought ,
Well their father ’s substance had divided :
The eyes like wells , where sun lies too ,
So long delays her flowers to bear ;
As it roared along the forest ,
From the same source comes number three ,
And all my reeds their softest whispers gave ;
Could only put into the lottery !
Of power to pierce his raven plume
And the lurking snare are spread .
Over the hills at every nightfall went .
Days passed ; each morning saw the maiden stand ,
Died away as the dark closed down ,
Her hands made futile gestures , she turned her head
They made warm welcome ; under tossing boughs ,
Halting and harsh , and all unaptly wrought ,
It sang the song she loved to hear .
See those proud foes , how undaunted they stand !
Or lap the air like the lapping tide
He holds on firmly to some thread of life --
And the night as quickly follow ,
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield .
The wandering soldier her grey eyes would meet ,
So lightly i played with those dark memories ,
Held carnival to welcome in the june ,
With sails to spread , and helm to guide ,
There shuts herself ; therein for life will dwell .
In harmony of joy restored again ;
Who gave them birth , kasyapu proud ,
There sees the summer pass and winter come ,
To divide the night from the day ,
Turned a countenance of fear
These showed , but rather like two lives which hung
You stand song-filled -- and free !
With aching hearts . around him groaning stood
Her conscious tail her joy declared :
By him whose thoughts are set upon
One god to brahmá ’s sphere assign ,
Filling the pris ' ner with abject fear .
His day he gives to sleep and song :
If life 's pleasures cheer thee ,
The old year greedily grasped his plunder ,
The complin hour comes last , to call
' in modest truth no light nor beauty find .
Where woman 's biting grip has left its trace :
The rainbow 's glory is shed .
Whose shallow brain each empty line reveals --
To pay respectful tribute to your brains !
As sharp as steel to find reality :
The glories ye showed to his earlier years .
The tyranny . this her voice within them told ,
While our sports shall be seen
The light of god which fills the earth
Until forlorn , entrapped of gods she felt ,
Which with so many foes has heaped the plain ,
No path we shun , no darkness dread ,
And now the tawny night fell soon ,
It has bowed to the dust thy stately form ,
The world 's cold breath hath broken .
And in the breath that made the mountains bow
The wind sings in my blood a song
Upon its ancient base and made the lands
Drooping and draped in black our banners stand .
And god put another in for luck , --
They pass 'd the day in peaceful prayer ,
The boundless love that mother gives ,
What made his heart leap with a strange surprise ,
To some dread place that they may never gain .
But weariness in little rest found ease :
Are chas 'd by certainty , and terror turn 'd
Our shadowy congregation rested still
And the heart ventured to believe
She crown 'd with olive green , came softly sliding
A young bird tries its wings ;
Though found the asylum sought , with boding mind
The wrath appeased , by happy signs declares ,
Thither came three sportsmen ,
They point me to the bosom gor 'd ,
That full of beauty time bestows upon her :
To paradise first tending ; when , behold !
In the faith that leads to thee ,
And leafy woodlands echo with new birds ;
No grain of wisdom pays them for their woe .
The curtain draws o ' nature 's rest ,
Nor the foe newly filled with victory ?
This cosmic fact , placing it square in front ,
From the chimney line that marks the rise
His course to ithaca this hero sped ,
That adds this wreath of ivy to thy bays ;
But all of the things that belong to the day
The tablet filled with but falsest lies ,
In the sweet spring had weighted many a word
Where satan tempts and angels come to shield ,
Mind can not follow it , nor words express
To make his retreat ; to make his retreat .
Sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast .
With heart that kindled to the call of song ,
And set his blown beard to the west ,
The dying hero fixed his eye ,
That gives and takes a long warm kiss
They drew him forth , he whined for grace :
Unwares assailed they were , unready found .
When guiltier arms in light shall melt away ,
Eight in each rank eight equal limits share .
You choose to take the patriot side .
Such as one feels who sinned in secrecy
Soon from existence dragged away ,
Of something good forever gone . i sought
On solemn wings that wave but seldomwhile .
Shrill pipes and horns with swelling clamor came ,
There he falls no more to hunger . "
Her soldier , closing with the foe ,
Pangs of hopeless , severed love ?
Drink , and fill the night with mirth !
Soon shall he fling the charging field
Which heaven to gaudy day denies .
The glory that is come !
Makes her believe them true .
The cause how obvious , when his reason wakes !
May find as dear a nurse at need ,
Or find such death as simon sorcerous ,
And , need be , share her sorrow !
To fill with novel thoughts your teeming nobs ,
As long as hell within his heart can stir ,
Of fair things blowing ,
Of a little lonely wind that crept
From slain foes by that glorious hero stripped .
The gold he piled went with his child ,
And opens to the day .
Of everlasting counsels , calls for thee .
To whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm 'd ,
That all stood husht and wondering ,
The queen 's attentive ear : dissolved in woe ,
In what i loved , left even passion just ;
By the same passion still possessed ,
There came no song from any bird ;
Hopes turning quick to fears ,
Good , there go mine in company with yours !
Sees his fair features paint the streams that pass ,
And shook it forth with a royal will .
In dreamland then we found our joy ,
Could to my sight that heavenly face restore .
Each spot where it hath flitted .
That but one night had wrought this flowery spell ;
Betray 'd by traitors lodged in his own breast ,
Turning to mirth all things of earth ,
In other 's countenance read his own dismay ,
As sacred offerings meet ,
So autumn went , and all the mountains round
That crowned olympus mighty as of old .
The tears fell softly through the deep .
And loving hands their sweetest tributes bring .
With affection that passed the platonic
By tales of dirt and danger fondly thrilled .
Till the whole tree take flower in unison ,
Freshened the wind , but ever fair it blew
And from its frame a soul dismiss 'd for spite
His noble courage rose , and maimed he dared
He , the one that forged the heavens .
Has found his upward way , i answer thee ,
Sad for the look which means :
Such as we find in fairy tale ,
That nature hung in heaven , and filled their lamps
Lived , and ran the race that nature set
And there hung the lute that could soften
While the waters murmur tranquilly
Of blood were shed ! what indian hosts were slain
It sends a dismal echo through my heart ,
And weakness gives warning to yield .
Which led where the eye scarce dared follow
They have reached the valley of peace who learn
And he spoke the words which follow :
" now give me absolution ;
But glowed so bright , they filled with fear .
Then off there flung in smiling joy ,
And with his navy beat the dutch
Portrayed in him the maker 's image stood ;
Till a hundred nests gave music ,
The april fool on the chimney sat ,
A merry heart goes all the day ,
As it came lapping the edge of fern .
She left her joyful harpings in the sky ,
Some charm , which being wrought upon the queen
My first high aspirations fell .
All june i bound the rose in sheaves .
That made him very rich .
Let 's make it full up by our sport .
The age of twelve has scarce attained .
The factory of sevres had lent
At the army of rats that was drawing near .
And shakes from one ambiguous wing
Nor give ourselves trouble about them :
And through his pulses shot a fire
But from the midst thereof a voice there came :
More gently struck on hearts inured to grief .
In silence some pilgrim the midnight may bring :
To hear what fortune is approaching me ,
Doth his foul treachery pursue ,
Of the reward for which it moiled .
She was the first to find the secret fraud ,
Have circled . if the power of sinning more
Thou , guided by thy wicked will ,
Bold in all evil daring ; and it taught ,
The angel of renunciation goes .
Monna giovanna raised her stately head ,
About them lay , outwafting strange perfumes .
Hope to her bosom brings -
Whom darkness still will cover ,
And now they beat against these walls of stone --
That trance had not yet darkened into death ,
And many a child made fatherlesse ,
Shall fill the happy days .
Ye voices , that arose
And wherever mischief 's to be got ,
Time would have dulled our sense of pain ;
She rose , yet not moved by affright ;
To give it sunlight , starlight ; while is blown
That takes the world into captivity .
This sound of hope doth labour to expel ;
Which an admiring soul can give to one
I caught the fire from those who went before ,
Forsake the path they loved to tread .
Nor moan of loneliness ,
Whatever it creates and nature makes . "
That over persian roses flew to kiss
Must turne to life , but there detained bee
He drinks success to corn in language hoarse ,
Thy sad tones hurt my ears .
Growing into a nation , and now grown
No sign gave she of crazing ;
My clay with long oblivion is gone dry :
Of birds and bees make the white petals shiver ,
And rooted in romance remain .
They reached as reaching heaven through .
A joy is folded in my heart ; and when
" i could have spared a worse --
And happy are the hours we spend
And lover must with shadows fly .
Oh come ! oh teach me nature to subdue ,
And the pure brow that wore it lent
And though they hear the distant cities roaring ,
The stone eyelids rise ;
She was prompted by simple desire
If word reached town that a bridge was down ,
Till freedom dug from law its deep foundations ;
To sorrow and to grief it should belong .
Until they reach 'd , as daybreak was expanding ,
Upon loving -- and that means
No marriages contracted to be broken .
He swift as time unto the train did pass ,
Thou must tempt the dark abyss
Bring sad thoughts to the mind .
All life with nobler life invest ? --
Since the mind to deceit it might lend ;
To dusky evening had resign 'd the roads ,
A huge tome , bound
Until those eyes be turned to thine . ”
That nobody can buy or bind :
More woes shall follow , and more heroes bleed .
And now that blind old abbot rose ,
A face of sadness wears ,
I have come nearer to thy greater worth ,
Which gathers shadow -- substance -- life , and all
Sixty-five , went daniel murphy ,
He was made to tend an infant ,
All nature shook convulsed with dread ,
Then ráma ’s face his rapture showed ,
And a loathing over sir launfal came ;
Like bulwarkes rising to defend their names ,
The incense will go sighing ,
The blood in rushing torrents welled ,
In whispers first their tender voices try ,
I could no longer read the laws
Yon -- contradiction 's lightning-shocks lose power .
Then make them promise never to bestow
Each promise with his blood he seals .
Proud in their careless transience moved
And the eighth day had passed over ,
Than when the autumn 's look embrowned
Than you whose name has gone about the world
Would quench and light again the lamp of day .
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed .
Lending the sacred gospel 's awe
And faith is never given
The lagging cycles turned at last
Was left behind , to spare his age
Of bounding words that leap the years to come .
Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill .
Cast my gaze around within it ,
This mighty consummation made , the host
And terror crept behind .
Could never lead thee otherwhere from me .
And we 'll give a rousing cheer , boys ,
The winter passes and the days come in
But with flutes of fear they filled the ear ,
Can make the flower fade that fills my breast
The other closed the gates and gained the day
Where once , in years gone by , i dwelt
His ancient royalties behind him lie .
Until to-day it lingers .
Tiring the settler out ere he reach his abode .
Held in thy law , i stand ;
The infinite number of these worlds he made ,
He turns the people 's trust to doubt
Fortune herself can lay no claim to it .
The son of raghu onward pressed .
This vine bore many blossoms , which were years .
Who never deeply felt , nor clearly will 'd ,
That shone as heavens light ,
But that gray ghost that clutch 'd thereat ...
And next she wonder 'd how his eyes could miss
We conjured spring , lighting the blaze
Brought down from genesis to the day of judgment .
Harsh the yoke that binds them , strange the girth
Cancel my hopes , and make afflictions new ,
Shine on the faces of her little ones :
The white leaves flutter , one by one ,
To hover between smiles and tears ,
And the light speech was rounded by a sigh .
No trumpet sounding , break upon the ranks
A lonely isle , whose bare coast bore
For touch of solace that gives grace to men !
Where grief ca n't reach you more !
The sun has oped a lustrous path of gold .
Winter was passing ; soon the year would mend .
Snapped was the chord that made the resonant bow ,
Than that enduring and strong anguish bred ,
Though restless still themselves , a lulling murmur made .
When the autumn days shall come ? "
And no ill eye the women cast on him .
The melancholy waters lie .
Thy people fathom life and find it dire ,
In debt to fortune , trembles at her power .
And make the people here , through covenant
For fear the conqueror should break bounds .
Shall life renew these bodies ? of a truth
Deep in my soul i felt the fire ,
Their voices screaming fearfully .
And cool its pulse of fire beneath
Long as the tail thou doubtless canst unfold ?
And that our hearts are drawn to stars
When the clock struck the hour for retiring ;
With moon-white hearts that held a gleam
And such success mere human wit attend :
Awhile as warm will set as soon --
Just to make a great show coming in .
Yea we were ever torn with constant striving ,
Turns out a lovely day . "
I meet the gay temptation , as it falls
And off that terrible curse he took ;
Which lured the soul of shakespeare as he lay
With chains of steel let the land be bound ,
Too blindly have reposed my trust :
Must clamour to the war to go .
By elenor from france . what follows now
A light laugh gave he ;
Where in days so long gone by
The syrian olive 's cheerful gift they bear ,
And a word that shall echo forevermore !
And thence , with faces westward set ,
And carried itself like a pile of dishes
The cross will keep all evil from the house
That she that makes me sin awards me pain .
On chaliced flowers that lies ;
When earth is bound with her silent zone ,
Twenty torches dropping flame ,
Restrain his fury , than provoke his speed ;
To awaken joy and gladness ,
When the marriage was held in milltown . "
Like smoke they rose from the violin --
There , woodman , let it stand ,
Such thanks the blessed mary gave ,
He 's wit and beauty all combined . "
The sands lay heaved , as heaved by waves ,
I think thy answers make me what i am .
May there my latest hours consume ,
The suffering martyr who makes no complaint
But first he has buried his wealth .
As ominous shadows swept over the roofs
You may discern what passion sways the mob ,
By glimmering lanes and walls of canvas led
Each to his grave , in youth have passed ;
Of sleep , declare that strife allows short truce ;
With ready instances , supports his creed ;
' the mist hangs round the college tower ,
That made the sunshine populous , lie close
The monarch ’s feet they humbly pressed ,
Her soul from earth to heaven lies ,
The townsfolk , terror-stricken , curious ran ,
Wherein his youth held careless holiday ;
The shadow of vanishing beauty , may not match
His happy arms stretched over
In weariness of body , something lived .
And , anguish overmastered for her sake ,
She will take thee heart and brain ,
As fits the holy christmas birth ,
Which meets contempt , or which compassion first ?
There dancing women swelled the quire .
To give the weary world the sweets of rest :
The wind , for kisses given ,
There to shape them into weapons ,
One can read the whole matter , translating her heart
All have mislaid fear .
They drew down wind along the bank ,
But when the fourth day came -- at noon ,
Worlds would i give to bask in those eyes ,
And adds perfumes unto the wine , which thou
As the swift seasons roll !
Fancy improves , and judgment makes your own :
Upon thy form more wrinkles yet will fall ,
Justice the founder of my fabric moved :
Fury returns , its ancient bent regained ,
The wind , the tempest roaring high ,
Of cherished song i pray for and caress .
Well , go -- take this comfort with thee ,
So fiercely pressed upon the greeks ' retreat
How oft the flame of love was fed
How light the magic pencil ran !
But where art thou when autumn , blowing ,
And the allies have woven his fate :
And death sits grimly ' mid the trees ;
Sounds of bells came faintly stealing ,
The world yet left one chance for liberty ! --
A sound must long remain ;
Imperishable wolfe , whose name recalls
Yet find no means save physic force : --
The healthful breezes o'er them blow ,
Soft are my fingers as the flowers they held ;
That i might yield my native air this breath ,
He showed what charm the human concourse works :
The young wives have fallen asleep
And the olifant its echoing music speaks .
Involves and joins them in one common blaze .
And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain :
And the soft wind blew it the other way ;
Gives way to northern and permits the clouds
And hid himself with glee ,
For baffled lovers , and to make him think --
" get thee another leader , charlemaine ,
Was with its stored thunder labouring up .
Up and down the heavens they go ,
Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend .
I fain my griefs would cover ;
Thy flitting form comes ghostly dim and pale ,
Would set his spirit free ;
And give thy lord a bride . "
Nor did more learning ever crowded lie
Will it discover nought to avert this sorrow ?
First to himself he inward silence broke .
Then a wail arose -- crescendo --
Which alban cities kept with sacred care ,
His saxon strength was written on thy face .
Bold bugles blowing points of war .
When even her love thy strength had to disclose .
And to still eyes stern thoughts a passion sent ,
In war incessant , still the clamor rose ,
In evil hour the nuptial rite intends ,
Comes the war , the welcome war ,
Much more than it has lost in fire .
The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of ,
Tears harden lust , though marble wear with raining .
When men pursue the veins of silver and gold ,
Fifteen leagues round the rumour of them grew .
But sudden there came a cloud ,
And now old eyes are filled with tears ,
That it may set his nerves all quivering .
So many things occurred to prophesy ,
Pined with mysterious malady away .
With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet .
Where the osier pathway leads --
That voice that rang so soft and clear ,
Though the wind hath fallen , they drift along ,
His coffin they pelted with mud ,
The forests and the fields slid off , and floated
Joys as winged dreams fly fast ,
And thou the flame shalt feel as well
To strike the old familiar lyre ,
She can never depart from her pain .
One thing to this time had his thoughts possessed --
And bind yet closer her dead bond of love .
Shall feel the spider 's enmity .
Their points came out of his royal side ;
So would i draw my satire true ,
And when the day of time arrived , when air
Some flowers that decked the barren , sterile place
And there lay them safe and sound ;
Be spent in searching : for his old intents
What transports should our burning souls inspire !
Ut quid he touched might turn to gold ;
The pasport ended , both they forward went ;
All the fragrance of april meets him
Their sheaves of arrows still contain .
Is fixed all on that which now they see ;
Until it reached the water of the bay ,
Of panic is shooting his bolt .
It can not find the wish 'd success :
Fell , and down fell the cream and eggs .
Their locks that tell of russia 's snows .
" turn , ye people , turn from evil ,
And all the body lies in deep repose ,
Nor yet the quicker will hot fevers go ,
Where lay in helpless dreariment
That acts in strict consistence with itself . "
Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds .
We thought that love could never change .
That will take him ' to his slumber ,
Struck quivering , and she slowly sank to rest .
Is vulgar breath that taketh honour 's name !
The cramps of terror gripping at his maw .
Catch my last words , and call me fool ;
When marius ' fainting legions drank the flood ,
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
But ever day by day against the sunset traced :
And the fog lay on the river ,
The sword of fate seems trembling soon to fall .
" it will not go for nought . "
His fear about the time to come reveals .
When dark and weary hours have tried us ?
It was like the lotus that lifts up
Lovers are parted , and friends go single .
The kings continued in the slot they 'd left .
A moral here should borrow ;
No jar of man can reach thine ear ,
He tamed his eagle eye ,
In mist and darkness went the sorceress forth .
If not , the frightful water forced a sigh .
What feelings stirred his breast when man was made ,
Cupid for thee shall spread the swelling sails .
Wrung from a spirit seldom eased by tears .
Within whose veins the sunbeams beat ,
Peace like a wave descends , is spread ,
Like arrow from the string was swiftly gone .
With blushes borrowed from my wine .
And the trust a true heart seeks : --
And hence , in time , destruction bring
With their shoes each step they take .
Delicious licence called it nature 's cry ;
Where twilight loves to linger for a while ;
Each cool breeze is playing with flowers growing near ,
Whose streams of holiness make glad
Perhaps it bears most precious fruit ,
Its pure good-will extends to all mankind :
Thus having said , the power of slumber flew ,
From spirits tempered in heaven .
Will bring a time we shall not know ,
Caught in the toils of nature , routed host
To give the wounds they will not cure ?
As burning as the seraphs feel above .
The wind is up , and drives the rain ;
And free to gama all his kingdom lies .
And join thy voice unto the angel quire ,
Will pursue with abuse .
There let the common heart keep time
But if success i must never find ,
He has refused to give assent to laws ,
Masks coming , printing themselves for an instant ,
But since the lightning ceases as it comes ,
Now , what sorrow can you comfort ?
Wept as the broken earth closed o'er thee ;
The violets that smiled with spring are buried
And what so potent cause took you to rome ?
Which once had held a soldier guard within .
Out of a city , seated on the right
In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed .
When age will come , with locks of gray ,
The trembling apples smote the dewless grass ,
As their faint perfume rose before the shrine ,
So felt our hero , when pure gospel truth ,
And down comes a little dream on thee .
Should all men take their right ,
Are filled with the glorious spirit of god .
Of lovely things about us spread .
E'en from the womb takes no release
Within his bending sickle 's compass come ;
That the autumn tells to the twilight pale ,
The best that a land could be giving
And it be true that merlin saw the truth ,
With trembling heart will own his fear . ”
Shoot of passion in him planted
His dam held that the quiet made all things
A land-breeze shook the shrouds
And forth the flames in answer flashed ,
Her eyes held dreams life would betray ,
A song , that seems to say ,
Bearing in his arms the winnings ,
Save to wait for the sign to come :
Than any merchant 's ledger , yet they shone
And sadder comes the moaning of the blast ,
Teased by the divine in life , and melancholy ,
Of her sore fear that grew from anything --
It leaned like an angel against the light ;
And accents fall to the knights below ,
Whereat the people rose up in the dust
That made him be beheaded .
Thy soul is seeking tranquil paths
That they convey these pictures of the world
No bound but heaven confines the spirit 's land !
Hath set the prairie round in flame ;
Could i follow the lover i loved so well !
In early fall when the wind walks , too ;
By driving winds the spreading flames are borne !
The utmost border of his kingdom , left
It shed its perfume rare ,
Disease , and sorrow 's weeping train ,
To see thy genius gather root ;
The yellow buttercups that shake for mirth
Then as they find their genius rise , to try
I struck the chords that all men understand .
' give me joy that in his name
And joined , this intellectual scene compose .
Teague 's honest joy now kindled in his heart ,
The common joys to make him glad ,
In duty found remiss . "
He trusted the time would return for our shining ,
The exile 's hopeless lot must dree :
Their hearts with new-found comfort stayed ,
Which common servitude engages ,
Were folded to , and the tears they shed
His drums ' bold rattling raise the battle sound ;
The same will come , you 'll find :
With this insolent rival ! with that thought there shot
Again his sullen guide to tease ;
The moments that come between us and that death
Are sweeter than the battle 's stir .
Thoas with grief observed his dreadful course ,
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
Murdering the livid hours that grope for peace .
Where all my hopes had found a sudden grave .
When now the awful groves ' gan fail to bear
Are those my publisher can show !
Whom war in its stern trade has almost steeled .
She , while apostles shrank , could dangers brave ,
But now the year came round again to spring ,
But the floods and the tears meet and gather ;
A jollier year we shall not see .
And genius finds its recompense at last !
At any time unto these senses showed ,
How heavy sits that weight , of alien show ,
From the creation of the world are seen
Foul usury doth not more lift itself
Where each look she may note ,
She flung herself against me , burst in tears ,
A king might wish to hold in fee .
Will such a ring be made ? "
How painfully must the poor heart have beat
With grief and rage the mother-lion stung .
Their presence in itself reveals
Have gone to their eternal rest .
That wrapped me in a cloud of dainty gloom .
Their dearest welcome shall prepare , and prove
The birds , who make sweet music for us all
By moonlight tread their mystic maze ,
My soul to find its fitting end .
The clouds go racing eastward ,
All the bright flowers that fill the land ,
And the white clouds lazily drifting by ,
A tear stood in his bright blue eye ,
There came no flower from paradise ;
Bad luck will surely follow .
Let every tongue , the father 's praises sing ;
There very weeping suffers not to weep ;
To leave behind such modicum of truth
To draw a rampart , upon either hand
Nor troy , yet bleeding in her heroes lost ;
He sees me in to supper go ,
For every wight which that to rome went ,
It tells my infant history :
Thus on the tale proceeded : --
The soft wind sang to the dead below :
That stood by the cypress and pine
Which he had fashiond in his wise foresight ,
And every flame a sinner steals away .
Only surrounded by crime and sin !
But leading beautiful brisëis forth
One cry he raised , one glance he shot ,
How very sorry china feels . "
Many who once had shone as monarchs lay .
With clouds and sky about thee ringing ,
The ornaments made by willem blaeu
So sings , half lost in light of light ,
With heart that kindled to the call of song ,
My soul stands still and sweats with fear .
The curled white clouds went slowly marching ....
Then came a sight that made the bravest quail :
The tallest flower that skyward rears its head
To hold and sway the hearts of men ;
In comes the playmate that never was seen .
The sleeves that appointed professor m'cosh .
The wintry wind , will toss the groaning trees ;
All found amusement there on every hand ;
And the storm has ceased to blow .
And give thee all my joys to keep .
The appetite remains , that this is ask 'd ,
There are three kisses that i call to mind ,
And the dark waves crowd the sky-line !
" here of youthfulness we reck not ;
He may furnish all the paints .
Best wishes and kind thoughts i give to thee ,
O'er man and his woes has cast .
Of depth commodious , then , returning , gave
Might find it good .
The winds their soft wings flutter 'd soon ,
A sweetness only known to those who feel .
The waves break wonderful and white
What my soul bore , my soul alone
Of days long since gone by ,
For ever laid low his herculean strength ,
The brownies safely reached the land .
Till heaven by miracle his life restore ) ;
Of nothing more than having good years to spend ;
To set forth his great dreams , and high romance
How far into foretime its origin goes .
Where heaven divided faiths united finds :
And in her agony a moment calls ...
Would never be paying his bills , you see ,
Low in the dust the prostrate creeper lies ,
Mournful sobs escape his breast .
His weary spirits gather rest .
Do i not own their strength and speed ?
Seeking the fleece and finding misery .
" boast not ancestral wisdom ; each man alone
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Nothing will stay them , the seasons go onward ,
And the moments in harmony glide ,
While meteors flashed from out his sparkling eyes ,
“ my hand the charge of thy destruction bears :
Unarmed , faced danger with a heart of trust ?
That o'er this brightening billow streams unfurled ,
The riven armour sends a jarring sound ;
That what i see and feel i write ,
Where i may never lay my head ,
The soft white flakes that fold the sleeping earth ;
Green , sunny green they shine , but still
Through this i looked on paradise ,
And when the rifted storm has rolled away ,
Of blindness , hung as a pall ,
When little baby bye-bye goes ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
And freedom 's fame finds wings on every wind .
To stir the clouds and drop the rain ,
But origin of tongue came long before
She kindles the desire
( long centuries have come and gone ) ,
Too few the tears that day and night are shed
A coldness seemed to strike , and now each limb
Through thee is martial glory lost , through thee
Their silky fleece ? of groves which india bears ,
Of that grim voyage , banishing the night ,
Holding neither a sorrow nor tear , emma ,
You had better go where fate leads --
To fall in love by plan and fashion .
So was the contract sealed between the pair ,
Deep sighs were heard and weird forebodings feared .
Bring me within the level of your frown ,
Transporting enough to make _ orpheus _ mute :
Only a dad but he gives his all ,
The text follows the edition of 1795 .
Hearkening the echoes of his lone voice cling
That came not laden with some new pleasure .
This touch 'd , alone the heart can move ,
The cameron 's slogan is heard from afar ;
Secure he sits and spends his aged years ,
Till the waves washed through the rib-bones ,
With this sad gift ? able to pierce the cloud
Lo , what wonders the day hath brought ,
Yet shall the fact not pass without applause ,
Closer and firmer ye twine round my heart ;
To make the road to heaven a railway trust ,
Bright look of hers for ever gone ,
Health wafted : torpid melancholy rul 'd ,
And this the promise which their oaths contain .
The leafy grove that covers :
In the port they made , they are delayed
Hence seers and sages , tossed in sin ,
And sent soft waters murmuring by ;
And bathed in fragrant oils that breathed of heaven :
But bacchus and his merry train have passed .
Just as he reached the landing , lion cried ,
So far i saw , no more could learn ,
Autumn comes laden with her ripened load
Then let me banish thoughts that sad would be :
Such thoughts at times filled him with melancholy ,
Purity went for a harlot 's jest ,
Up and down the heavens they go ,
Give me the thrill of the task ,
They watch the heaven with eyes grown wearied
Him helen follow ’d slow with bashful charms ,
To where a mirror leaned ,
Far other aims his heart had learned to prize ,
Who thus presumptuous enters on this reign .
No cloud should ever dim thy sky ,
When last words sink into moans ,
Bore him back with what strength remained ,
And , after all , old age may come
Belongs in that realm , you will find . "
He looks through life and only sees its end !
Till time has struck the letters of one word --
Which gave us holy writ ;
With fountains leaping in the sunny air ,
His fearful secret whispering disclosed ,
And oh , the hurt of it went deep !
That it to tempt his guards might be applied ;
Wealth can not stop the torrent of reproach ,
And to ulysses gave the freight in charge .
Which gently broke the wickets three :
They bellied up three deep and drank his health .
With music waiting on her steps ,
Send forth their fragrance like a wail .
As a sacrifice they bring .
Willows dip their slender fingers
Ye shall cleave unto joy at last --
For death from sin no power can separate .
This heart i found in my breast .
It blew the engine into scrap ,
Till a kiss sets free !
The music of a fountain , which arose
The tears we shed -- the prayers we said
I feel thine embrace .
All figures heaven or earth can yield ;
Malarious fogs bringing the fever chill .
And from his limbs the vital spirit fled .
Let him take heart , throw off his fears ,
That breath of eden which all hearts wait .
Where lay the peril , through the choking gates ,
Abroad to gentle airs their folds were flung ,
Such rich provision made .
To light can never rise .
To bring rome in unto the way of life ,
( let theology say what she can )
The moonlight trembled , like a mother 's smile ,
And jokes that must be laughed at shall proceed .
The single talent well employ 'd .
Into the golden orient lies ,
The moon thy lover sheds an opal glow ,
Bronze bell-notes poured from deep blue wells :
Still rang that voice , when sudden rose
That cast its light a thousand miles and more .
Where perhaps some beauty lies ,
The shape of love his soul should form ,
Lost on white lilies , and the blue
Could to my sight that heavenly face restore .
That kindled once with passion ,
'till here cabot descended on the strand ,
Tying the horse to his vast foot that lay
The meadows cool that breathe their fragrant myrrh ;
And the sun lit the flowers
Who makes the sly physician his heir .
Though space and law the stag we lend ,
Made one with hissing blackness , caught , embraced ,
His flight philander took ; his upward flight ,
Which proves historians should be wary .
By those brief words , accompanied with smiles ,
Let the times run on their course ,
Their voices make me feel so solitary . "
Tall trees lean down upon the mighty flow ,
And that great rogues may hold their state ,
Look on joy it gave to you ! _
That leads to the quiet hill-top ,
To the one great war went he :
Again replenish 'd , down again it goes , --
My mallet served to knock me down ,
Swooning they bore her upwards . all my robe
Camest here to give me torture .
Amongst the laughing and the gay i went ,
And with the soul strikes partnership ,
And melts with melody the blushing fair ;
They mark 'd the great bear wearily
You know what qualification throws
" men their cunning schemes may spin --
Our burdens cast upon the lord ,
In measure what the mind may well contain ;
And so in all to make life beautiful ,
The smiling spring comes in rejoicing ,
A something so transporting bright ,
Since ever the streams began to run
To aid his fleet to gain renown .
His heart , and indignation fired his eyes .
This ill appears his furious hate to slake :
Though she shuddered to feel that it grew to be
Which comes but at thy sight ;
His aspirations without wings would fly .
Of the havoc they have wrought ;
Hath lost , through influence human or divine ,
In words like these addressed the pair :
Which fifty wains might scantly hold .
A sound came from the land ;
Making the darkness deeper where hides the nightingale .
That to his fortune it is given
Then by sacred custom raised it
The bud comes back to summer ,
With that she took up a loud laughing ,
The last green milky bubble blinked and cleared .
Yet dares not stand the hazard of the die .
When juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight ,
Ravenna hath maintain 'd this many a year ,
And farthest from the heaven which circles all .
Till truth were freed , and equity restored :
The west was cloudless while the sun went down ,
And caught a richer lover .
" he is caught ! " so goes the saying
There came a sound that seemed to say ,
And add new beauty to the evening walk .
" this modest genius breathed one wish alone ,
From their thrones they sprang to find thee ,
They ring the tune of enderby !
All this my heart could dwell on here ,
" build for home , build for love ,
Heavy with death unto the ground , yet made
What fortitude the soul contains ,
Want and incurable disease ( fell pair ! )
Thy guardian help our lives to save .
Delight , that breathes and moves forever ,
Yet could i there two days have spent ,
Or laid aside forlorn :
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
Filched from the wrack of terror 's urn
Flooding the firmament with mystic light ,
The promise to the fathers made
Led by my love i deem not pain ;
In lowering hate against me on the plain --
Is not all the life god fashions or reveals :
Pulsing and breathing , rocked with delicate gales , --
It was love made the change ,
Where sky and sea lay sharply edge to edge .
And whose venom comes from hisi ,
Tam didna mind the storm a whistle .
The salted seas once held this shrimp ?
Her feet disperse the powdery snow ,
God bless the empire that loves the great union ;
As by some artist to whom vulcan gives
Yet stained , misused , brought sin and shame
And struck me , that it went
And in the wood he makes his wail ,
" and drove her forth to liberty and life .
The woodland dove made music soft ,
While the still morn went out with sandals gray :
Swears he " gives lawes ;
A beacon-light swung in their mansion above .
I 'll give him means to live at ease
And spiteful whizzed the balls ,
His rays and binds the clouds in golden strings ,
And branches waved their long farewell ,
Mass upon mass , the hurtling vapours driven ,
The lightning leaps too , at my ravishing songs ;
As the market kept by day .
In the warm blood his hand hath poured ,
The extinct stars drink with the dreamer 's breath ;
In a shirt that hung in tatters .
To give him comfort , but he turned away ,
How oft has bitter tear been shed ,
Or a fit expression find ,
And take the fortune thou thyself hast made .
Life looks to me worthy and bright ,
By frosts that fled before the rising sun ;
But out of the gloom springs the holy
Of pealing joy , the plymouth bells outclashed
The face slips under my eyelids ,
The nearest spring-day sees me here again :
He in the world great haughtiness displayed .
A soul resolved would find the means to die .
He calls upon the grisly power ,
Midway bound potentiality with act
And that of spain which followed to the fight
Then winter clods fast froze with northern wind .
Was broken by a tear .
They part not till the ring is broke :
All melancholy clouds vanisht away .
Naught shall touch the features terse
And midst the roaring blazes threw ;
Hast thou not felt her sunshine on thy face ?
For i feel it is love ,
Like pillars of fire starkly stood .
That its foundation laid .
And wakes new fates in each desire of man .
She made reply with smile as sweet
For dusty streets to leave his native shade ,
" by means of a secret charm , to draw
He followed her , and told her his design ,
Pack , clouds , away , and welcome day
And forget us till another year be gone !
But rank and lost the paths in lone decay
Before the rising sun had touched with gold
Lo ! i waste good hours of love and kisses
Vengance take upon this wrong .
And my grief had moved him beyond control ;
A visionary form prepared ; it seem 'd
She stole aurora 's balmy breath ;
Though to corruption now they lend their wings ;
Love which felt , but dared not tell ,
In life embark 'd , we smoothly down the tide
Shall come , and you stand wholly mine .
A guiding torch to the benighted ships .
By civil rage , and rancour fell .
Trot , trot , the baby goes ,
Of men was every tree . if faith be given
The curtain fell upon the stage of life ;
The soft night-wind went laden to death
At length the second night arrived ,
Which made the arbia to run with red ,
Happy love is come to woo
To beauty be the homage paid ;
And who commanded ( and the silence came ) ,
The splinters took another road --
But darkness o'er the scene a curtain holds ,
Where youth courted and glad childhood played .
In her thy color white new terror wrought ,
Would give me life and soul anew ,
Which told my heart how vainly passion raged --
Hath made me wholly lonely on the earth ,
And more than a hundred spirits sat within .
Yet poked aw melancholy ’s ribs ,
The sun that maketh bliss of all ;
And o'er the picture drops a veil ,
Were banded to oppose his high decree ;
Then by the hand the sin is wrought ,
And heavenly dominations are set ,
When thy love with our love can compare ;
But how it comes , i never kent yet ,
But tranquil , fixed , to wait the end .
The song that spreads some glorious name
Still meet the living god .
-- and added , without using farther art ,
That speaks the calm of sabbath afternoons ;
To reach a loft where i may grieve alone !
Both gods and chariot-ruling warriors lay ,
And gave them strength again .
As fits a warrior race .
So , silence reconciles life 's jarring phrases
Died -- and took the finest grave .
That thou hast won them some content it brings ;
What confusion would cover the innocent jesus
And the heart that has hoped is tired .
I wonder how the rich may feel , --
Shall he pretend to unfold the word of god
Or ran the chromatic scale up :
Occasion seiz 'd commands the action 's fate .
Partly to get the praise she loved .
As isaac newton showed it ,
Fortune and honour , fronted , held the field --
Keeping their merry pranks a mystery still ,
No more for him the streams of sorrow pour ,
Pity from blustering wind or swallowing wave .
Rent from her breasts her garments ; beat her breasts
That could show me that you loved me .
Tears of ages come in a stream ,
And by her beauty are sustain 'd ; nor when
While the blind years ran .
Her donations were such as noted the sorrow ,
Such truth he to my intellect reveals
In grief which they alone can feel
For death takes toll
Tongues that prate not -- many an eye
It hummed and died away and rose in swells
Softness his perplexed hand would writhe and swim --
Full on her sister , and destroy her peace ,
What gain in kingship should i find ,
They marked each burning breath he drew ,
" yet greater numbers to my lot remain . "
A streaky mist , that upward slowly spread ,
And feel my journey nearly done ,
To beat away the clang of hellish wings ;
Took his soul , his ghost , his shadow ,
Shall meet the eye of traitor
And tread its paths in haste ;
What mournful scenes arise :
And vows are asked and given , shadows rise
Pledges , till life should be spent .
And watching close the turning thumb of doom .
I will not follow thee upon the gallop ,
Saw misfortune fast approaching .
And a raid was driven athwart the raid ,
And drives the monster , spleen , away .
Though vain the muse , and every melting lay ,
Made to rock the infant 's cradle .
This made him cry with rage and spite :
Will fill all the place of your loathing . "
He gave one little sharp sad lingering cry
With desperate courage that makes cowards brave ;
Has loosed the cannonade .
What tongue of mortal man could all relate ?
Night when the storm sings and the forest bows .
In that day 's battle dealt ; nor only then
Above the trees are towers where dread bells beat .
At eating-house i sought relief
The powers of prayer were soon displayed ;
The powers that rule for good or evil ,
Nor can i miss the way , so strongly drawn
There 's an ancient volume that i recall ,
He snatch ’d the fury-goddess of debate ,
In the soothing thoughts that spring
Hence is that secret pardon we bestow
With angled schemes , and crosses that bred fear
My shrine , have ever brought a spirit cased
And order hurls disorder from the throne .
To what thy fellow-mortals see ;
Must greet a soul that ached for her
That can come from heart-fears ;
Thy wings can waft , thy mines can hold .
King trying to get money from taxpayer .
And virgin 's bower , trailing airily ;
Where no foot has left its traces :
The air with flamy brilliance flew .
The rainbow 's glory is shed .
Unless thou couldst return to make amends ?
To advise his king in these extremes is come ,
And her words are such as follow :
Why stand with wildered senses ? fate
The wind did sing and blow ;
And when the monarch 's sons his prizes gave !
And coreopsis goes to seed ,
Of victories but a comma . fame could find
Go make a lovers ' calendar , "
The silver fountains sing for ever . far
Up he flew , but his song , remaining ,
And answer came there from the creeping gloom ,
Her eyes another 's eye could shed a tear .
Thus to conceive and bring it forth to life ,
The only thing that can give me joy .
Nor ever pandered to the throne .
With a flag of truce held out .
My heart was shaken with tears and horror
For , as each pause the echoes fill ,
Whatever hope in vivian 's heart remained .
The robins stand as thick to-day
But when the latter works its own undoing ,
Are rare . with this distinction take my words ;
Wilt thou debase the heart which god refined ?
Where is plenty , and to spare ,
The stream flew this way , that way ,
Through the drear desert followed still that flame .
All that exults , -- brings but despondence
Away in service . dost thou not recall ?
Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty ,
The hour shall come when , crushed by woes
And find a heaven in solitude ,
Their terrors harmless , tho ' their story heard ,
What heavy burdens from our bosoms take ;
With the tears that sorrow stole . "
Had all revealed , had they but given heed .
The winds are rising , a long murmur comes ,
Not ghosts , but friends that lived and moved ...
The stars that crowd the summer skies
In the beginning , earth gave forth , around
See how prophetic rapture fills his form ,
But softly came one
The twin gates rise a hundred feet .
" as comes the smile to the lips ,
How to my arms my lover downward slipped .
Lo , on the secret in whose darkness lay
Time to me this truth hath taught ,
The bliss that touched the verge of pain ,
More beauty clung around her column 'd wall
And he spoke the words which follow :
The love of all men gained .
And aged phoenix , to divert his grief ;
And shadowy forms with staring eyes stalk round ;
Which fond recollection presents to my view .
The song had borne her soul in peace .
Before the chance is gone
And may feel pride that she hath given birth
Of the drums , they go to battle .
Toward him ; but him wrapt in clouds opaque
Men 's lives shall waste with longing after me ,
Like faded roses ; and that seemed to melt
Which having gained , he left the state
That leaned their trembling grace above a pool ,
The little creek goes singing
Fixing his downcast eye , he many an hour
Fitting it is that here , where freedom first
Renews the grateful song .
And where death cannnot come .
Doth every beast keep holiday ; --
Something that grew to thought she cherished you ,
His shoulders to the weight , alone , applied ;
As if that soul were fled .
And so the childhood of the heart will find }
Then through my brain the thought did pass
We reach the wrong when most we seek
My soul that lingers sighing
Though caught in her cup of gold ;
Lips that love had moulded well :
Which he hath take , thanne he seith
And look through nature with creative fire ;
For nature made the vánar wise :
But the wronged world beat my portals --
And shivered by their force it broke
Nor nearer than the gate presumed to draw .
And by degrees from underneath it came
I must let fall the long restrained tears
Which neptune in his choice sees fit
Which mid the mountains leaps in furious mood
And in duration ( how thy riches rise ! )
Where all the fires of fame burned glory red ,
While the dew fell in showers from the passion flowers
And this alone makes heaven perpetual bliss .
Devoid of meaning , on his hearers fell ,
Toward which the spirit longs to peer afar ,
Whom concord leads , and hatred warms .
Still thy vanish 'd smile i see ;
He would go down through darkness to despair .
But winter draws us round the ingle ,
For christmas that comes so near . "
Seemed best for cures . the malady progressed
But still there came some cloud between ,
Life with life -- made one for ever
But this poor man he did bring healing ,
Of false appreciation quickly fades .
And pictures , there , by nature drawn ,
And cheerful to his home returned .
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven .
But lost , for heedless folly doomed ,
Oppression , by his constancy , and left
And while on his sofa his limbs find repose ,
Which shut to clouds , and shadows nicely shun ,
And go prepared for changes . now you look ,
Where still the farewell beacons burn ,
The moral lesson bears , drawn from such pilgrimage .
Of ecstasy was trembling , full with tears ,
In some sweet flower we will feel the sun ,
With tentative touches that lift and linger
But to her heart the silence went , and then
Right against the wind that blew ,
The church that man might find most fair
While strong affliction gives the feeble force :
With courage new with wrath and valor swelled .
The home of all that makes them great .
Turns added beauty , like the veins that run
That the close forest branches made ,
In strictest bondage , though thus far removed ,
Of heresy , having falsely held the sun
To drive the cold winter away .
Childhood vanished , youth departed ,
In the days that had gone by ,
And to his heart came dreamy thoughts and dim
Poured in , to serve warrants
That we a holy life may lead .
This burden on them weighed --
Thy fortunes still thy genius shall restore :
And , touched with the vesper glory ,
You 'll pick my logic all to holes ,
And glad tears shone in the daisies ' eyes ,
At the mischief your eyes have been making ! "
And grievous was the fashion of them found .
Our enemies would twist into a curse .
Threatening peaks , while stern seas bound it ,
' no flocks that range the valley free
Like champions mailed for clanking war ,
And builds a heaven in hell ’s despair . ’
If in that heart or grief or courage lies ,
Fear shook the nations : at the voice divine
Their shadows in the waves were thrown ;
Two hands apart whose touch alone gives ease ;
To twist with him and take his bruise .
Until my soul could moan with pain --
Gamble-roofed the cottage stood ;
He sits superior , and the chariot flies :
And hearing within me your melodies ringing ,
In whirlwind ; hell scarce holds the wilde uproar .
Remorse so bitter that it leads to death ,
The glorious bharat thus addressed
So i can get a line on his affairs
They point but to despair .
Across the land came a magic word
Soon she spreads the cruel tidings ,
And the marvelous notes they sink and swell ,
Dim and mysterious , folded deep in night ,
Filled my song with a soul of fire ,
The stars , the circling heights of heaven ,
For iron winter held her firm ;
For now each idle breeze can bring
Ecstasy enters me and can not speak ,
Whence comes it save from fortune setting free
And best by her that bore her understood .
Spirits that shining with untarnished light ,
That retrospect brings close , the thought of god --
Had turned his better instinct to a vice :
The youth , for everywhere those rumors went ,
As the sun sank low in the tender west ,
The wonder of what had been witnessed , sealed ,
And ever since that martial synod met ,
Has snatched with rain the heaven from our eyes ,
In whom stern courage with soft virtue join 'd
And half my sorrow 's burden took .
This to the lunar sphere directs the fire ,
Our line from vinatá may trace ,
To bring the great work to accomplishment .
Surely ca n't mean we are ruin 'd ?
To tread the way his will may show ;
Come , prove the blessing , follow me ;
That grim sir roderick owns its sway .
Thine earthly shape , which earthly eyes may bear !
" and bid our horsemen clear the ground . "
Our fathers held by purchase ,
Gives all the strength and colour of our life .
Gives each tired toiler rest ,
Her body and her thoughts arose . "
And guarded sighs of maidens veiled and pining ;
That held me as by witchery bound .
Tired i was ; my head would go
The morning comes to consciousness
On every giddy wave of fortune toss 'd ;
Duped by a lovely witch . before he moved ,
But now the wild flowers round them only breathe :
Fell not , which makes a month 's romance ,
Themselves , for that great spectacle prepared .
She , there ? she 's coming from confession ,
Make haste and leave thy business and thy care ,
To her black noon the night hath grown ,
They brought against it , gathering all their force .
How worse than folly is their labor made
The antique persians taught three useful things ,
His outstretched arms receive ;
And is himself that great sublime he draws .
Delight makes all of the one mind ,
And in his cell , when death drew near ,
And eagerly his name was buzzed abroad ;
What shall we do when hope is gone ? "
And the light stubble burn with crackling flames ;
Another of adam lay lone ,
That tear which only feeling hearts can pay ;
Ere many moons our mournful lot will change .
What pain could get between my face and hers ?
Find a count that the others had missed ?
Then the musket shots ring out
Would find a theme in reverie ,
That sets you spinning through your pretty teens .
And make its bliss complete ,
To give her refuge from this festering sting .
For his strength allied to goodness .
Our church " hath stomach for them all ; "
Of amorous dreams that have made her waken .
Life like a star shall climb the height ,
Whose name was wrung in every key of praise ,
Of pillars , branching off from year to year ,
And then , continuing , it said : " therein
To a sheepskin gave the story --
Underneath these possessing words that never fall .
That broke and bore precipitately on
The thought alone has set her quaking .
That is not paid with moan ;
There catch her ilka glance o ' love ,
The silent tears that fall at dead of night
The little clouds went by ,
And if you 'll blow to me a kiss ,
Of those , who load them with committed sin .
In rapture lost be lapped within the all .
Then sunk pylartes to eternal night ;
Of the dear names that lie concealed within ' t.
Fire had swept from pole to pole ;
Remorse arises , and the sun grows dim ;
To leave the haunts of men
For bringing the world to obey your behest ?
Nor loving-kindness helped to show thee
Can bear to him as water bears to me .
He wholly searched the moorish army through .
In simple childhood , spread through ours !
The clamor rang unto the pallace toppe ,
Nor give one tear unto thy shortened days . "
Thy memory shall remain .
Shall crime bring crime forever ,
The angry north to wage his wars ;
As all her body yielded to his kiss .
Abhor divorce : what love of union reigns !
The lofty rapture from that womb inspired .
All crime and conflict ; thou art covered with glory
I took my power in my hand .
And follow christ wherever he may lead :
That hides divinity from mortal eyes ;
Let her coyness then take leisure :
Yea , even that which mischief meant most harm
Which opened up perdition .
The dew lay heavy on his cloak ,
Met on the mornings that followed ,
As strong arms timed heap measured blow on blow ,
Which served no more its senseless lord ,
The driving dust proclaims the danger near ;
Who truly follow me through storm or shine ,
Has filled the west with light ,
Yield up their leader . him they place before
Where to the power an hundred altars rise ,
My throat sings the joy of my eyes ,
Never to living ear came sweeter sounds
Burn your soul up so in hating .
And the dandelion hides his gold ,
And he glared at the roof like a monarch bereft
Dispenses powers as his pleasure shall lead him .
That gathers thunder of infinite ululations .
Ere autumn fell on the vine-tressed hills
Return , and make you good voyage ,
That 's played upon by heat .
A king can make a belted knight ,
' gainst countless foes i 'd wrestle .
The merry dance , traced fast and light ,
And how each night brought tremors and trepidations
Ye would not stay your dew time to expect ,
And i , tossed by the tide of circumstance ,
Who favor greece associate to repulse
As watery clouds are swept . from lofty skies ,
The green leaves buried him three rounds of moons .
How obscure a name he bore ;
And rich , as fortunes are reckoned
They rose -- embraces none were given --
Lie to ourselves and cloud our brains with lies ,
And the ogs are determined to wage a war
And when stern death shall loose that loving band ,
Is rudely touched , a tear will bring
Still burns the old achillean fire ,
But i have entered into sympathy
Each common object brings .
In scorn of nature , art gave lifeless life :
Your memories rising glide silently by me .
Where never winter chilled the year ,
Now i absorb immortality and peace ,
Another , drawing tresses from her distaff ,
As pale it lay upon the rosy couch :
Whose weariness no energy can reach ,
Rough and severe , denying bliss .
Is it the wind that moaneth bleak ?
That the world was made for good !
Want is a softer wax , that takes thereon
Setting in florid beauty , like the sun ,
Each army stood : the spartan chief replied :
It forced the foremost to recoil ,
Of scripture hold supreme authority .
And languid pleasure fade and flower again ,
Then was the sea all covered with the war :
Years fled , and weak and old grew he ;
Where war and terror shake the troubled earth ,
We see assured us by this victory ,
The cynic school asserted
And gives surcease of pain with final breath
You could not there have cast a grain of sand
Ah , woe to women death passes o'er !
Dost still remember how i made a vow .
Then let the march tread our ears :
And the great bluff stands between .
Scarce made aweary by the sultry day .
That winds its way ' mid grassy knolls ,
He got it ; for their captain after fight ,
This sad recess to murmur forth her woes .
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy .
Altars he raised : and as the sacred flame
Like flowing gold shines the sea .
The swelling banks of violets did curle
The gaudy rose , when autumn comes ,
The years shall come and pass , but we
Whatever brawls disturb the street ,
While pale lips tell the fears that swell ,
That tested out the rope , a muffled thug ,
O'er stock and rock their race they take .
Look to loathe , or look to love ;
That the sun-glad world lifts free ,
Thy absence from my sight , but to avoid
As the hearts that met at riverside .
To crush the single foe ;
When the ku klux verdict is given there .
And the yellow waters tumbled round ,
But the full years have wrought equality :
A little bay rests softly
And giveth happiness or peace ,
To six and seven their figures run ,
Thee in mine arms ; for mine heart whispered me
Round each green holly leads her sportive train ,
When you have reached the shore ?
And when morning came , arose an uproar ,
From the male group the carol came --
The sombre , guarded bay .
A gratulating shout was reared ,
And shrill clamour arose in the camp ,
As wave after wave swept bravely by .
And gave her people rest ;
Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain .
Round , round the roof does run ,
A small moon slips slowly out of space .
As arrow from the string : death followed him
To prolong and enjoy the gentle resting
That cloud and change his face , while desperate sorrow
His days passed in a strain of toil ,
Not in the wine but in our taste resides ;
And all was rimmed with sky ,
Putting a sadness where the beauty was ,
In will of youth shall grow to deeds !
Detachment of three columns took its station ,
" did they make something lonesome go through you ?
Mocking the fane which genius builds to time .
Which showed him an illustrious cavalier .
This is the only profits poets see .
As darkness only lives for light 's dear love ,
The foulest impressions i easily take .
The powers of nature in me , lest they run
Still there the sweetest charm is found
Settling made sweet the heart that was not strong ,
And some way made each to the other known
Historic marbles to record his praise ;
Some laws ordain ; and some attend the choice
Whiles yet the heavens of heat saw dances wild
Had sought that refuge in his hour of dread .
In love that scarce can give a dying kiss ,
When a poor wanderer struggled on her journey ,
Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim
Between these two there rolls an ocean wide ;
Delicate gold that only fairies see .
Giving thee proof its parts are not compact .
And thence their ways lay different .
Our pilgrim 's progress still we took
Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging .
Where outrage hides its lusts with murder nigh ,
Which they dare not meet by day .
The life that brought me happiness --
Give _ me _ the sound of martial music while
There instant answer gave he to my suit ,
Cold with the sunset never more to rise !
So clear i see , now it is done ,
Of mortal birth , by earthly food sustain 'd ,
But comes -- as sure as christmas comes --
The cannons are roaring retreat and advance --
Or ever gained true comfort from his sacred word .
And smile at a folly i would not share ,
To fight the battles of the lord !
Of the stupendous virtue it possessed .
Where doom sits poised -- each monster 's goal !
Would give your father pleasure .
Every grove hath found a voice ,
In death 's uncertainty thy danger lies .
A dragon stems it by its shape ,
In delay there lies no plenty , --
For youth goes over , the joys that fly ,
His dim and faded majesty ,
And every height comes out , and jutting peak
When sleep had bound the merchants fast ,
That here it finds the awful power of love ?
Now rings the woodland loud and long ,
Twilight came ; silence came ;
Soon should their hopes in humble dust be laid ,
The nations who confessed king juba 's rule .
Heaven send your heart-strings ay in tune ,
Warm welcome ye will get ,
The moon had cast across the river 's breast ,
Like silver crowns , the pale narcissi lay ,
Where your proud altars stand !
Yet shall that dust perceive thy pious pain .
He sings of a redemption wrought ,
On which the herald placed for him his share
The aneroid has dropped a tenth !
That checked the prow of the audacious gaul ,
_ his _ fair face lifts from the sea ,
They made a vow with lifted hand
Until he came to the tide , --
Left all my crew remote , laving my hands
A cord the gods first slung ,
Winter would stay its stress ?
Thus affinity comes welling ;
Of fountains that the ripple shakes ,
Where seemly ranged in peaceful order stood
The breeze with cooling fragrance blew ,
And the signs promise peace with liberty ,
And moved his brush to write a new song .
Here greatness lay , by humility guarded ,
That never gives -- tho ' humbly takes enough ;
Who meet this kilted race ,
Minerva , from whose hand the olive sprung ;
Thither the monster makes his furious way ;
Here where these grasses thrust between my fingers ,
And gave me eyes to read of the unwritten
Stock without master , wasting year by year ;
That had covered my life with its dismal shroud
To their own great land they are drawing nigh ,
That made you what these poor , dull mortals call
I would sink back to nothingness again .
Upon their spirits there hath come a breath ;
Upon the pagan who the dragon holds ,
And reached her shoulders , conquering their snows .
They saw him feel for the hilted steel ,
Of roses he has leaned upon ,
And theirs it is to make it flow --
Where many honored names are linked with thine ,
Shot in piercing swiftness came ,
And reached the region of eternal fire ;
This found i true by proof , hearing that spirit
My frame was shatter 'd , i betook myself
But leave the poet poor and blest .
Nor ruth nor mercy 's trace is shown ,
Had such a debt to pay .
To whom the senate gives no private arms ,
The biting axe of florence . farther on ,
The sandals given by ráma ’s hand ,
Thy shores i tread with joyous measure ,
By mortal pain was torn .
To find the wished-for day ? "
What wealth the show to me had brought !
Fed with some perfumed oil that shed abroad
And making conquest , even of the sun .
But the list shook in his hand . " _
That chrism he laid upon his eyes ,
But his ill luck we must not smother ;
Then horror rose
Yet i feel in myself bright buds and blossoms ,
" rights of man ! who gave to you
Nor unrewarded shall thy praise remain :
Love floated round her , and her eyes
' while little to the purse it brings
Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease .
What resistance could she offer ?
But marmion gave a sign :
In full assembly of all greece be laid .
And lips whereon his lips can lie ,
The stars shine out ; the forest bends ;
Coming with the bitter chill that marks the death
Where lay in ashes sagar ’s race .
Shall leave all grief and unlearn all things sad
While blending voices gently swing and sway
Clouds in the evening sky more darkly gather ,
Straight to the lonely graveyard went his steps --
Sees his beaten columns fly !
And , ere the eye could follow him ,
Of god 's command to reach his eager ears ,
And the rude rocks rebound
To ignorant arms that fold
He who struck terror into all the world ;
To janak ’s child his answer made :
By pity moved he can not choose but weep .
On his people stood a frost .
Where he for debt was laid .
I will build up a temple , and set you
One look exchanged that our two spirits took ,
Smiling , but suffering , i feel ,
If the red-eyed lantern made no sign ,
Follow thy flight through immensity !
And the wolf sprang fiercely at her ,
And bless the hand that stretches forth the bread .
Thee too the years shall cover ; thou shalt be
O wilt thou give me rest !
My whole heart rises up to bless
Their wounds our breasts will share ;
The sequel of it then will i unfold .
Was quickly mantled with the gloom of night ;
What , worse than folly , urged this genius dull
He gave them souls of divine seed .
Than death itself can sever ; still the sight
Serene within the shadow , crowned with hours ,
And as plague she formed another .
And loving words fell sweet as summer showers ;
So i could make my rest .
Or richer joys than clay can feel ?
Nor holds he fellowship forlorn
The sun-beams lit her gleaming hair
In delay there lies no plenty , --
Ere they could snatch a view ,
The shepherd danced , the gilly ran ,
But mine to smite with inward grief , --
In bitter words that pierced and stung
Who keep pace with the present most awfully fast --
Never yet a star went out .
And bade , like thee , his athens ever claim
Roughly thy share through our boasting has ploughed .
Washing the ridge , a clamor of crows that fly
Nor spent his life in poring on the dead :
Had drawn me wholly , to its burning top .
What help in living love may lie .
For office , told how fortune had abused him ,
To hades merciless fate is bearing thee ;
To it a happy name is given ;
Before the stars have left the skies ,
To read the secret of my heart , --
An hundred years should go to praise
That bends the branches of thy tree ,
The universal , which now stands estranged and apart ,
To show some signs of conscious life began ;
Her virgin fancies , pouring forth more sweet ,
In the land which gave her shelter .
And where our vanguard rests to-day
And he dropped his line of cedar
To others ’ wives his fancy turned .
In all her charms reveal 'd the goddess trod ,
Hephaestus sits and strikes the flashing ore .
And mirth revive , and brighten as whilere .
Prince edward lived , and money made and spent ;
And bathed in tears .
It pierc 'd my heart and echoes still ,
That potent charm , which none can fly ,
Dependence made a thing for winds to blast ,
And threatening fate wide opens to devour .
The douglas thus his counsel said :
Like moving mounts slow masses trail along ;
A half a century has passed --
To sigh , yet feel no pain .
Their scottish zeal , and compacts made to grieve
That time will come and take my love away :
This closes the eternal gates of hell ,
Then romance lived and breathed and burned .
Her brooding thoughts would pry ;
With long descending locks , the tapestry shows ,
Before the city knew what was at hand ;
Of night or loneliness it recks me not ;
And midst a peaceful dream had stolen away
And look the love that shall remain --
The earthly paradise , made for man in his original
And joy and music through the isle resound ;
The joys of love she gave ye never ,
Here saints their fires of worship tend ,
That calmly moves within its own allotted space .
If the dark face of slavery on you turns ,
For him , those chambers held barbarian hordes ,
Are counted somewhat deeply in their debt ;
To show that one heart was loyal yet .
With chariots matching thought for speed ,
Brings back our hour of fear .
It answered : " thee as in my mortal frame
I follow 'd him many a long year .
Fair couple , linked in happy nuptial league ,
The curious gazer searched her mien .
With its shadows cut clear and fine ,
His sorrow only by his silence shown : --
Then made reply : " a conscience overcast
We dreamed a prophet , flushed with faith ,
Before the dew is gone ;
Nor to let scruples overpower
And the stately ships go on
For all the day they view things unrespected ;
Howl the lash 'd surges ; man and monster freed
Where the spring wears pink and white ;
Thou beauty filled with sweetness , o provide
Fast as he can stretch and leap :
Above all love of sense on woman set ?
Millions of lilies mix 'd with roses .
As the rapt seraphim that sings and burns .
But they made answer to me , no :
And pierced with woe his life resign .
And strange , dim shapes pass wistfully
In good green wood that ran about ;
Between them an extensive valley lay ,
To furnish mutual aid is not enow ,
This brings it both wealth and renown ,
Since from the tomb alone all bliss we claim ?
Where look for peace ? when cease to mourn ?
Of pain and ill that human life must bear ;
He ceased . there came a glad reply
To deal the blow that abel had of cain .
While restless thoughts were stirring in his heart .
And golden light shall touch each sacred tomb ,
While there 's a grief to seek redress ,
Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth ,
Nathless , i found this truth not easily :
Though fear till then he never felt nor knew .
And now a meteor draws a lilac line
I found far sweeter than the scene below .
A mist cloud hanging at the river 's brim ,
Shall fade , decay , and perish .
Holden by any loveliness seen of earth .
His pen will run at such a rate ,
" greatly his opera 's strains intend ,
Whose eye explored the dim arcade
Established laws aside they threw ,
Are delicate things to handle and to wear ,
Bore it two months , bore it three months ,
To share their converse and enjoy their smile ,
No time remained to then undo
Piercing the secret purport of my speech ,
And made resolve to speed his wooing on
That washes of all we crave :
The proclamation made for may :
All its former warmth departed !
What pompous scenes our busy thoughts engage !
It finds the foxes so replete with fraud ,
In the very words which follow :
Is begged to state all facts about it ,
All my soul thrill 'd and panted for bliss
And all alone went she .
Take wagons from my hand , make no delay .
Where teeth of foam the fierce seas gnash .
His lacquered shelves hold priceless pottery -- peachblow
All balzac 's novels occupy one shelf ,
The promise of a perfect yet to come ;
With words of sweetness may lie cold .
Thus his trusty sword makes answer ,
Your world is growing old ;
Embrace wherein two sweet arms held him fast ;
Fancies and figures and shining goals ! "
That oft invites me to be blest ;
And pass to hoary age and die .
Quickened his fancies , stirred his heart as well ,
Sinks slowly . mingling with the sullen stream
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory ;
A place where forest-fires had spread ,
Can beat his shadder , mighty near !
But stars endure after the moon is past .
And after him his sacred vestments swept .
To let the world of sinners see
Where aye thy breath with glory may be spent ?
Another couplet follows in the manuscript :
Take no delight ; because indeed they are
Fame is not silent , here in hope to find
" let yourself slide down among us ,
To feed the river that now rushes free ,
But here the old rabbi brought up a suggestion .
The hour will come when i shall hold thee fast
While the sands o ' life shall run .
Her blue eyes filled with scorn .
Till all-discovering time shall further truth declare .
Sighing , as back thro ' ages flown ,
With arching necks their regal course they bore .
Its fitful and mysterious dirges play .
Such chains as his were sure to bind .
Shall make thy actions with their ends to meet .
He from the floor the quiver took
Pleasure is good , and man for pleasure made ;
The nightingale 's faint song draws near
To lower sails and gather in the lines ;
He reached the top his sponsor said ,
The flame that ran from side to side .
Bearing tonics not labelled to soothe .
Of fancy rise full springing : but not mine
Where love 's rainbow-songs are ringing .
A conqueror , to the gods we raise ,
Some old emotion long had ceased to live ;
I felt that from folly fast growing to crime --
The sunlight rose and the shadows fell
It oft would challenge me the race : --
Till the hears that shuddered before thy sin
O gracious nations , give some ear to me !
All came to the royal old fellow ,
All in silver , housed in azure ,
As clouds with clouds embrace .
Tones that in past days made his soul rejoice ,
Since reason not impossibly may meet
They lie so many leaden years behind .
He followed them under the whip .
Ere the bee again came buzzing ,
Some breast that glows with virtues all divine ;
But slumber and oblivion take care
With sprigs of summer laid between the folds ,
The hearts of the nailers who follow hounds .
Illustrious deeds have done , which fame shall sound ,
Rose , to be torn in sunder so ?
Of sacrifice our happy brothers wove thee :
To whom , as bursting sorrow gave the flow ,
He fancies every vice she shows ,
And draw from these full eyes of thine ,
And wander their way to the devil !
( red rose leaves will never make wine . )
For by its wane and wavering light
Of fragrant ferns , dusk mirrored in the pond .
Because i gave that counsel , covers up
With that came in a wealthy knight ,
And foreign climes must cater for thy taste .
The world is bounded by its present hour .
There came an end to break the spell ;
Of tides that work some heavenly rhythmic will
Shout until the hills have told ,
The rose would blow when the storm passed by .
His knightly faith so well kept he ;
The painless place where such a soul might dwell .
What joy sufficient hath november felt ?
And ate the fruit the branches bore ,
While our children rejoicing will share in our toil .
Who is yonder poor maniac , whose wildly fixed eyes
To meet the bounding waves ;
And age the wanted energy denies .
My soul so sad a farewell could not bear .
The chieftain 's sight was filled , of gathered turf
And the sea answered , with a lamentation ,
The cold that cramped and froze ;
To ecstasy too big to be suppressed --
Rich hues have marriage made
Pity seeks kind pretext to pour its balms ,
These swell their prospects and exalt their pride ,
The fury sprang above the stygian flood ;
To keep 'em from all winds that blow .
And it turned to a sonnet .
With woe , and her eyes gazed and yearned .
Sole , but with holiest meditations fed ,
A second bow soon armed his hand ,
Or the splendour that there lies
There poets find materials for their books ,
Seeking the fleece and finding misery .
And the summer passed , and the winter came ;
That gentleness to which belongs
As though a ball had pierced its heart .
Cast thy sighing to the pine-trees ,
Beside the porch a club was laid :
Which makes the mighty magnet , set
That will take her to her resting ,
See ! to eternity shame has consigned thee !
Increased with gore , and swelling with the slain .
But tingling through the ether and searching star by star
To minos down he bore me , and the judge
_ " where does pinafore palace stand ?
To link the words of prayer :
Oh , grateful for the good his bounty gave ,
To my lands he brings destruction ;
Thy smiles called up feelings of rapture in me ;
And full of winding mysteries of ways :
And felt themselves forgiven , as they were ,
This burden to be borne through all her days ,
" ambition 's slippery verge shall mortals tread ,
Piled up small stones to make a town ,
Five years have circled since these eyes pursued
A flash of lightning , wherein came its wish .
About his neck , the duke this answer gave :
Her dark foundations , and too fast had bound .
By toil and famine wore to skin and bone ,
Her eyelids fell down and she seemed to sleep ,
Strikes fearless at all evil that it knows .
How soon my lucy 's race was run !
Days and weeks and months they sped ,
See where an army covers all the ground ,
Wherein my heart delights to dwell .
And if she thought it followed her ,
So still the ruler by the ruled takes rule ,
The meadows with a silver ribbon binds ,
While earth regards , aghast ,
And son went down in glory , with a german
All the hid paths of heavenly love i trace
We 've seen the seasons through ,
The labourers would catch a song --
And hid her lack of faith
And learn to look at all things
From his limbs he made it crackle ,
Whereon the heavy golden circlet lay .
And promised her she should next sabbath go again ,
For my perfection made you feel
Her tears afresh began to run ,
Leads them the way our saviour went ,
To mark my progress and my coming wait ;
The holy man had reached his eightieth year .
To fight privation , and the lonely days
And only fire drawn pure from heaven
Much courage added to much might and main ;
And passed in silence , leaving a whiff of herbs
Didst brave the wrath of gods and give away
Who daily devours what news there is
As fate 's resistless bat directs the blows ;
Now fast approaching , all men 's thoughts were turned
His soul , though he had broke his seal !
Where hungry warre had made himself a guest :
And , deeming that all hope was lost ,
And perils speed their love when true .
Spring 's early violet , that sweetly opes
Though she tried to assume a cheerful guise ,
Have sent thy wits astray ;
And the moon made answer to her :
And follow both the bridegroom ; so the bride
Invested where ' twould bring a safe return .
The strong temptation that had moved him thus
When each heart gives out its best ,
Whose ardent hope , intensely fix 'd on high ,
Into himself they instantly returned .
Saw that truth had gained her right .
To feel the silence and the gloom
The busy chiefs their banded legions range .
With someone you can rush and crush and kill .
Shall shine , in realms celestial ,
Remembrance and a fresh vigour he 's gained .
Fits life to love like rhyme to rhyme ,
And interchanged life unto them lent ,
Love takes his way and holds his joy deceitful ,
By this fell curse of here , driven
Our wiser lesson shall be told ,
Saul has passed , the good and great .
Slowly they gain 'd the gulf , to scare away
Watching the leaves drift down .
May take for itself to rise ,
And loosen on us dreams that waste our life ,
And reached fruition and died .
Where well they knew that the monarch lay .
That joy anew thy heart shall fill :
And where that conduct , which revenged the lust
Such noise their passions make , as when one hears
And death , who saw that of the jobs on
By cultivation now would they diminish .
Has touched and tuned or rather thrilled my heart ,
But yon proud work no future age shall view ,
Still as she spoke she gathered strength ,
Which in the dark earth lay ,
Like iron that comes molten from the fire ;
Better to catch him kissing and be gay .
Those words , a short black shadow fell
The terror of his soul renewed ,
How do you now a place of mourning prove ?
And flamed the limitless welkin . terror fell
To perilous pass was brought by evil wound .
Forthwith in faultless diction spoke :
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow ,
And by degrees from underneath it came
That numbs the soul with icy hand ,
' twill make a man forget his woe ;
Do not ask the ways of others ,
Your image , set in memory 's gold .
For we to him indeed all praises owe ,
As of a cloud that softly veils the sun .
Across so many lands ; so oft was struck
Rare gums and spices fed the fire ,
That held her down when the last struggle shook
His scattered legions , and beats ruin back ,
Yet though my flowers be lost , they say
A wain bound east met the hearse bound west ,
Following their sovereign with dejected hearts ,
Brave at the masthead her new colours fly ;
And the old priest put out the waning fires
And so the sleeper murmured on . sometimes
A wind blew out of a cloud , chilling
Do not give thyself to sadness ,
And if some tears be shed ,
“ in crowds of sisters , refuge only found
Therefore a mighty muster was being made ,
A paragraph in every paper told
And they shall see your shame . "
The fenced path leads .
Save that which cometh from the pure serene
Since first they laid her here to rest
No answer came ; but faint and forlorn
Then came stout confidence and right good will ,
And spread a banquet in his frugal house .
All the woodlands ring with music ,
Then measures them by sympathy ,
Some flowers are withered and some joys have died ;
Hop away ! pop away ! here we go !
To where the monastery stood .
Yea , even that which mischief meant most harm
And to follow the star wherever it went .
Where stiff processions filed around --
Why is thy sight still riveted down there
They tell of light and love unbroken ,
There go the loves that wither ,
Looking to outward things , i found
Of god had in her heart found place --
That found it so " rich to die . "
That touched the shafts of wavering fire
Take this kiss upon the brow !
The marble still his memory keeps :
Yet borne as bravely on , and spreading liberty .
A reduction to make for low prices of grain ;
And creation 's last boundary stands on the shore .
Turning all loves delight to miserie ,
To take of pite remembrance ,
Shall safety to italia 's plains arise ,
Greenwood and rocky glen echo their lay ;
Before him , proffering humble faith and love .
From them whom grief unfeigned had stirred .
Back to their simple dwellings go --
And leave the pursuit to those princes and nobles
Which bring our soaring thoughts from heaven to earth ,
We penetrate our life with such a glow
Ripe as the melting fruits they bear .
To dusk hath waned , yet comes once more
And overcome by memories that could brook
Up sprang the vánars from the ground
My soul goes up , with joy ,
While in warm floods ecliptic breezes rise ,
Then rose the cry on every hand :
And in content may turn them to their sleep .
And from them issued forth such dire laments ,
And fills my soul with joy divine .
Then do they spend their mouths : echo replies ,
I wonder where it comes from ; sea birds cry
And passing strange though the thing may be ,
There came a respite to her pain ;
Such ambush hid among sweet flours and shades
It led , from all this strife for millions ,
Yet often would flash forth the fire
Or give it such a furious bat
Hearts had been beating long before they spoke ,
And courteous greeting gave .
And scorpion critics cureless venom dart .
And showed the order taken for the deed ,
Then when the sunbeams gild the glowing skies
Sweat dropped down upon the runners ;
Well cultivated , it will render double .
The butterfly chased in his foraging flight
And all thy stony path with darkness hung ,
And twenty clubs rose o'er the king ,
Faith , fatherland , was linking .
To mourn , but meets no sympathy in sounds .
He , from his face removing the gross air ,
And she that wove it may weave again
All birds and beasts lie hushed ; sleep steals away
As dear a friend as i find in you ,
Yet could we turn the years again ,
I feel the vigorous pulses of young life ,
His sweetest song was given to love ! "
Which comes so fast -- oh ! who shall stay
High overhead giotto 's tower soared ;
Its green leaves lost in richest blossoming .
Each whispering zephyr owned his love .
To give repentance to her lover
But he found it cold and lifeless ;
And his voice rang free and glad ;
The story went the round for years ,
You bid me , father , count the cost .
And the red express my anguish :
Some showed an easy , graceful pose ,
Can i make earls by three and three ,
Was driven from the confines of his birth
And vows are asked and given , shadows rise
There fell upon his ear
Had planned to see me , ask for clemency
Not close my doors and dream solitude liberty !
If to my sight the fearful truth was given ,
And swift were the wings to our feet given ,
You cut her claws , and sealed her eyes ,
A time i see , not very distant now ,
Fighting foes and fighting pain ,
And he within it gave a cry of joy .
And may new states arise , and stretch afar ,
The eastern shores see faint tides fade away ,
Why does that twining plant the oak embrace ;
Dimly i catch the throb of distant flails ;
With banners glancing ,
No rumblings rose , no thunders crashed ,
Which have fallen in our way ;
That longed to leave the olden scenes behind
Their souls embracing to their bourne shall go .
By homely thorns : whether the white rain drifts
That makes the world rejoice , --
To shine and lighten greece ,
And pale dawn stole in silence through his cell ;
Pensive hast followed to the silent tomb ,
Love doth make the heavens to move ,
Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place ,
My brothers ’ lives are wrapped in gloom ,
For it knew well the softness of her touch ,
Resolved , when daybreak brought the gladsome light ,
The hillside 's dew pearled ;
That eye that can unmov 'd behold
Thus sorrow and despair make bold bopeep ,
Steadfast and still , nor paid with mortal praise ,
Thine ear , nor leave thy heart quite disengaged ,
Sack the house of god , and scatter
Setting the stars alight
Scarce from our hearts had gone the sweet surprise ,
And seemed , amidst new forms of horror bound ,
Is to give burial to her lifeless limbs . "
The fleecy clouds their swelling sides display ;
Some lyric , breaking like the sea ,
An owl sends a hoot from the hill ,
Far-called our navies melt away --
Was draped in style that claimed the greatest praise
Or helm to handle without fear .
Whose scythe casts shadowy crescents
The mountaineer cast glance of pride
And linked itself by carnal sensualty
And death itself should but be felt
Her hope is near , no turn she makes ;
And a wandering road blown bright and bare
Touched by an april mood of tears and smiles
No mention was made in the service that day
Evil thoughts recoil upon him .
That gave me back my form and power ,
To feed the marble founts of kings ,
Seems even to infect my spirit and consume ,
How the mayflower tossed alone ,
But magnus suffered not , and held his troops .
Where one shorn tress long stirred the longing ache :
For all thy goodness lent :
That one lost chord divine ,
Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light ;
Takes somewhat from the riches of her purse ,
Waking wish and stirring sigh ,
Subjected , makes them drag the ponderous plough ;
Cease . what yells of fear arise !
Filling every month with cheer .
So closed the task . " deathless the creed
Noise of war the echoes bring ;
Of perfume shall fling up into the air ,
Summer came in the country ,
There came a sweet , refreshing smell ,
The impulse from the earth was given ,
Is like a hand laid softly on the soul ;
That seemed to come from far away , -- perhaps
I feel the conqueror in my blood and race ;
It made him whistle , it made him sing ;
To frame her cloudy prison for the soul !
Vow , whatever light may shine , --
To own a sympathy with suffering man ,
My shafts , if rebels court their fate ,
Where the strong zephyr with his burden sank ,
What nature prompted and a lover prayed ;
Her two eyes flash like cannons bright
It tauld how time did pass ;
_ ships have swept with my conquering name ... _
The waves lift up their voice and cry
Assumes th ' organic powers its seed convey 'd .
Theologians all to expose , --
Upon her cheek lay fluttering light .
O father , touch the east , and light
But to the fading palate bring relief ,
Filled with burning amorous feeling .
When thickest dark did trance the sky ,
By such degrees to joy they come ,
Instant my looks with troubled ardour burn 'd ,
While nymphs take treats , or assignations give ,
The clouds with orient gold spangle their blue ;
And blew upon my side , and beat a flame
Strong as the breeze of morning , rolled
Nor careless was the watch by neptune kept :
When an outlaw broke from a station mob ,
Flesh of rotten trees will make him . "
Living , one cry that cursed him broke ;
And heaven puts on the blue of may .
Where armies lie encamped , come flying , lured
For pity could scarcely a single note sing ,
And the roses have made the softest carpet
Now is the time to show by deeds of wonder
And clouds in courtship flock , and run
So doth thy beauty make my lips to fail ,
Full knee-deep lies the winter snow ,
When warm love makes the pulses thrill ?
Is doomsman pestilence addressed ,
Believed , and took his line in evil sort .
For livelihood to labour took recourse .
Just so it went till i ended up
The soft south whither thine heart is set ?
Who felt that christ indeed had risen again .
The sun is rolling slowly
That laid such spirit in a sleep so sound ;
By powers the bards of heaven had lent .
Coralline smoothed the evils it had wrought .
Keenly feels the pangs of torture ,
What woes the mournful face of india wore ,
Where white fusiyama lifts proudly its cone ,
When help was most needed it paid most regard ,
And next came forth the reverend convocation ,
Long shadows ribbed the tent in white and black .
Evora still the grateful honour pays ,
And fierce unusual glare was thrown
Nought gives them check or fright ,
Stars come low and wandering here for love
Nor dare the secret of a god reveal :
" then the brother fell to weeping ,
Across soft turf with dead leaves cleaving
" which means ? " queried pagett .
Then round his breast his wings he wound ,
All rites well ended , with fair auspice come
From there where all surrenders come
But trails forever its own enigma .
But they heaved the billow before the prow ,
Can not confine the heart that 's there .
Because the people ’s hearts are bound
As wild and sweet as the life he led .
Strength to bear it will be given ,
Shone through and made her wasted features bright
The storm that swept through battle-days ,
Purer thoughts shall stir within thee ,
The mother 's daily fear of what would come
What 's got by justice is established sure :
But their wise heart knows many things
From cold , which makes me yield
Who there would not pass the sweet day ?
Unrecognised , they bring their lost delight .
Less sweet i find it than i found
And birds take places overhead ,
To lead such dire attack ?
The great king arthur made a royal feast ,
To one fixed trust my spirit clings :
How fled the vacant , solitary hours ,
Mean lawyers waxing rich on fees .
Which near our planet smiling came ;
And lightning followed when they clashed .
The memory 's soft figures melt away . _ ]
A scene of sorrow waits them now ,
Dark roses , deviously thrust
Apollo stood , the trojan host to save .
They drew , constructed ladders , repair 'd flaws
In comes the playmate that never was seen .
Steve as a runner who has reached his goal ,
Through me you pass into eternal pain :
Left him smart as they are made .
That never sailing on its waters saw
Nor caught me in my flight ; and sorrowed
And on thy lip such promise hung ,
To make ready for fourth of july .
Where sin , and sin alone , was made
Thy erring shaft has made our bravest bleed ,
To obliterate the world . he took no heed .
The eternal mountains beckon , and awakes
Beyond the moat that girt the wall
And the highest clouds it pierces ,
One planet broke the lingering ranks of night ;
A lustrous heavenly orchard hung the west ,
That issued from its brink . on earth no wave
My hair shall never more lie smooth and bright ,
And troubles that attend on state affairs ,
Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps ,
't was well enough when summer came ,
Can bear a charm like thee ?
Learn all the lore that love can teach .
Yet pity shone transparent through the same .
So much still shines on us the sovereign ruler .
“ corporeal charms , did but my blushes raise .
She lingers while the moments run ,
He planted and despaired not ; till he left
Into despiteful rage and hatred turned .
Who saw these tumults done and tempest spent ,
Let every billow swelling round thy breast
That it would make thee see ,
And then the chestnut-tree its glory wears ,
Till the blossoms awake to welcome the may ,
More firm ; who most examine , most believe .
Falls calm as storms drop on an autumn day ,
Calmly to heaven above thy footsteps call .
To forestall ravishers left the victims chaste .
And he spoke the words which follow :
A too transparent artifice to pass .
The good , that gives contentment to this court ,
Of timid crocus thrust through drifted snow .
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
And all who heard it shuddered and turned pale
The stars return their slow , familiar way ,
Far other dreams my erring soul employ ,
A tiny archer takes his way intent
Whereat her tears began to turn their tide ,
The flame crept up the portrait line by line
That had made prints upon the ground ,
That crowns the meadow grass .
Everything went along right ,
Into whose keeping christ did give the keys
Naught but the wind and sea made moan
I feel a music which comes straight from heaven ,
Konrad tracks witold 's every look and motion .
As if the wounded lotus-blossoms
And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound .
To go on forever thus !
To love and penitence revealed .
Of gems that in their bright shades play .
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought ,
Sudden a burning chill assails his bones
Without drawings to follow , or patterns to trace ,
That i the tenour of my creed unfold ;
A poet whose garland endures ; --
Amongst the _ commons _ is such freedom shown ,
From my lips the tones are gliding ,
Where never christian pierced for thirst of gold .
Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill ,
A secret hid from mortal eyes ,
Whose mighty arms their foeman quell ,
The race of brahma comes .
On his death-day i gave my groan
Cities to found and citadels to set ,
Such proof thereof the knight erewhile had made .
Statues amidst the thickest grove arise ,
Horrid to think , how horrible to feel !
It is because my gloom gets some respite
As great a marvel then would have been held
The veil of chaos is withdrawn ,
And the veins in his forehead stood taut .
Or were i , love , the robe which flows
It only shows us where we strayed :
As all their souls in blissfull rapture took ;
It grew , when the hangman entered our bounds ,
One night came straggling soldiers , with their load
Yet forward moves the furious attack ,
Waves lifted by the waxing tempest start
In this their trouble they look up to god ,
The moon hung above us like a golden mango ,
And help to wounded foe extend .
Earth quaked beneath her feet : dread blasts of fire
And find free passage to the skies ,
Had holy truth in painted frescoes shown ,
Wherein they took a fresh delight .
And here 's to the days that are gone ,
-- our thirsting hearts drank in the breath
With light united , day they give ;
Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came ,
And smote , to utmost fury wrought ,
When your time comes . how years slip on !
Of " the faith that works by love , "
O make in me those civil wars to cease ;
Soon will the sun behind the hills sink down ;
Forgiveness and thy life to save .
Which ever takes the fairest shows for truth ,
But while yet the charm was passing
That only sings amid the orange-flowers .
On every breath that sweeps the sky ,
The bleak november winds , and smote the woods ,
And thy strong shafts pursue their path
Our reason made right and hearts all love .
And my youth comes back to me .
And from its fragrance caught
And taunts of scorn they join thy name .
In the most truthful least the will they follow .
Rosy and sweet come the hush of night --
Old voices echoing ( or my fancy erred )
Which sinks should bear me past all fear and sorrow
When homeward adam came , the child she set
Give the fir-trees shining silver ,
So has another paradise been lost .
How could the smallest comfort here be flowing ?
Now twilight dims the waters ' flow ,
And buries madmen in the heaps they raise .
Horizontally there lie upright politicians ,
Pounce comes a storm unspeakably more hideous
Of fiery stuff ; and then its powers succumb ,
For fear and melancholy meet ;
The hosts on two opposing mountains stood ,
The prison where our hearts lay bound ;
Where slim yachts dip to the singing spray
Shall our epic strings be strung .
Love , or she 's lost for ever .
With tangled gossamer that fell by night ,
Take heed lest his beams fall on you ,
The power of manhood in the poet shown .
Spring has come back to us , beautiful spring !
His friend came down to meet the ferry
No good from him the town will get !
In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath :
Can come the lucid morning 's fragrant breath
It hung -- and moulder 'd there .
In the front they bore a statue
Which soon will gain superior place . "
Was made by mrs. adams , where she cries ,
If the fish wo n't take your bait ,
Thy honest face has greeted us ,
The maiden gave that her heart was broken .
( baseness with insolence forever joined )
Pain is to save from pain ; all punishment ,
Jealous of the applause they gave him ,
And down the long aisle stole away ,
Of late stood time amid the scenes of life ,
The tyrant stood in kingly state .
That showed dislike among the christian peers ,
With here and there to give it life
And gave the first alarm :
History this tale will tell ,
But war disturbed this vision , -- far away
Of conflict crowned and drowned in olives of peace ;
Thought a short life well lost for endless fame .
The mistlike banners clasped the air ,
And take delight in its activity ;
Now melt into weeping the sorrowful heart .
Ye deal is felt the wide earth through ;
Even in scripture as we find ;
And all the charms its bowers possess ,
I feel as glad as they . "
With glad resolve to take the fatal leap ,
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
Yet all these offerings brought from day to day ,
It stood as in a candlestick a candle ;
Pain that was memory stirred by his song --
Poor cord that held my foolish kite , —
And shine forth in happy overflow
The last lone aster is gone ;
And a new progeny descends from heaven . '
Seek the happy and the free :
Some creed of which its prophets cry it holds
Gold and throats and thighs in stages heaping
Answered in the words which follow :
Acting on particles which from filth arise ,
As following his guest he rode
He , to clear my doubt ,
So our extinguished passions too , should rest .
I found its tongue was withered , poor thing !
Both , lest thou lose thy liberty ;
The visions of racing came thronging
Plagues : they , astonished , all resistance lost ,
Its meanings traced on stone and bark .
The sickening pangs that follow after .
Again the factions rise ; through all the world
And heaven has sealed the oath on high .
He passed like light across the darkened land ,
I gave her absolution . well , you see
Has found his upward way , i answer thee ,
Sudden anguish came upon him ,
She can not see the life she gave .
Whom we are bound to cherish , for the poor
Had halted there , the same expression wore ,
That i might once more reach that plain
It finds a radiant rest
There comes no voice from mere or rill ,
Ere all the blossoms go ! "
Her glorious fancies come from far ,
Some secret treason or enchantment lay ,
That brought me in to thee ,
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast ;
Beckoning me upward . let me rest awhile
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
Graceful to tread the dance , or to repose .
This sword that dealt full many a gallant blow ;
But to the cross he nailes thy enemies ,
My grief perhaps his pity may engage ;
And his own rights defended ;
Look in mine eyeballs , there thy beauty lies ;
Who had the gift to seek and feel and find
But spice that grew a thousand years ago
Long years of misery have told me so .
Law after law was made excluding them ;
With music that is sound of joy made flame .
It watched the centuries come and go .
With upward growth may reach and twine
" oh who are these that kiss and pass ?
Till the names are called at the muster-roll
And here and there their swelling billows casts ;
The eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn ,
But i shall add them in a brief appendix ,
Mourn , europe , for our england set this crown
Where soil had been to clasp warm seed and throw
If changing empires rose or fell ;
Apollo then aeneas bore away
The new world 's chain lies broken here !
Too young to feel that i was young ,
Could make a gentle belle reject a lord ?
And discord ' mong themselves arose ,
Restrain their fury , or direct their force .
Oh , nature brings my straying heart unto thee .
Where broadest spread the waters and the line
One hour , the next hour found us separate ,
Which gave his kinfolk fear .
And held it so ; while helen made the air
Fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe
In groans their souls vexed and afraid .
The paradise whither insurance men turned ;
Despair sat shrined in her dry eyes --
Though in the midst of life their spirits move ,
That once alarm 'd , when britain rose ,
Will testimony of them e'er remain .
We must leave it now to fate .
Displays her tyrian wealth , and rising town ,
And so to glide through busy life ,
Break , and are lost in one withdrawing sigh :
The evening star needles the sky :
I flung myself on shore , exhausted , weak ,
The day of battle came , and he ,
And twilight melts around the steps of love .
And how it came about that blood was shed .
What gruesome shapes dawned on my startled sight
But long lashes veiled a light ,
The varied colors run , and while they break
Now rosy may comes in wi ' flowers ,
I can number the hours as they pass .
And you can not well give him the lie ;
To bear high fortune , or endure the low !
The guilty thinks it pity ; taught by thee ,
Of painful blindness ; leaving thee forlorn ,
Serenely to his final rest has passed ;
The sunny and rainy seasons came and went
A little snake quivering with anger sped ,
But cold oblivion seeks to fill
Bids it go forth .
Yet gather but sweetness from all !
That makes my heart a page of prose .
His every sail to catch the lightest breeze .
To where it stays its lucid flight
Are such as heaven had dealt to her alone .
When rage or other passions pass control .
As though her rent heart bled to utter it .
I catch faint perfumes of the blossoms white
And when the sun renewed his light ,
By noble winged creatures he hath made ?
Were spilled by winds in playful rioting ,
The false another portion sought ,
And to his grave will go with scars ,
Tried the horn , -- it owned his power ;
Fierce foes in front and flashing arms behind . '
Another rock will yield you passage safe .
Raised of themselves their genuine charms they boast ,
And straight the vision fled . a female next
" my thoughts laid out my precious time all spent
As slow or swift he feels their magical caress .
Nor by division was vermilion made . "
Remote from clamor , and secure from foes .
Thy smile might still have fed its tranquil light ;
For in their hearts so much there lay .
That is but left to a successive trust ;
Whose fear and hope reach out beyond their ken .
When wrecking waves give tongue .
Oh war , when truth thy arm employs ,
And finds too late that men betray , --
So they might fit some vague opinions ,
Made certain of my sleeping
That she could raise this merry-hearted one
The veil of cloud was lifted , and below
As every paltry magazine can show its .
Did not fill our hearts with sorrow ,
All hope of conquest and revenge was gone ,
Earth shall melt , the stars shall fall ,
Brave sad tales that the sea wind sings ,
It teaches him in pain and sacrifice
That leads the withering moon on cloudy stairs
The clouds that strew their shadows far and wide
The curse is gone , the bond are free --
Her face beamed on me like a glimpse of heaven
The spring has passed , the summer fled ,
When will return the glory of your prime ?
Ambition here displays no gilded toy ,
The green savannas swell the maddened cry ,
Till death brought silence and relief ,
Piercing the secret purport of my speech ,
Her breath coming quick as if all but spent .
The highest air and ocean 's bed they pierce ,
After he had taught how the sweet sounds came .
As life is copied in the form of death :
When her house i reached , i cried :
The plague its foul appearance made ,
I take myself and thee as mine estate --
While tears and sobs her utterance broke :
It stuck so fast , so deeply buried lay ,
Sweet thoughts of peace , ye may not last :
Doth with great lightning-tramples run .
And seen a splendour trailing from on high ;
That opens into worlds unknown
Twilight came ; silence came ;
At tenderest touch will shrink and go .
The trees no whirlwind felt , nor tempest smart ,
And wrap my kisses round its sleep .
But now all 's past and gone ,
Till the little lambs leap with delight ?
" that aloadin placed them to reward
It squeezes thro ' the crack between
Which may be found of use hereafter .
Held back the sun , a greenish flare
The band of peace we thus have riven ;
To the evening repast the relations went all .
How ruin had come and victory ,
And bring the world and beautie into dread :
Parted , alas ! i carry from its source ,
Saying , christian , follow me !
These lords and i before thee bend :
The loss so great his life could never heal .
In this monster 's overthrow firmly now stand .
When the thunder ceases pealing ,
While the sign of battle flew
There lies the lovely land i know ,
And august comes with ebon nights ,
Nor potion found he to purge sadness with .
To thee they owe the moral song ,
Of milton bend from heaven to meet his own ,
Or rattling coach that passes .
The pine trees whispering , the heron 's cry ,
Meanwhile patroclus sweats , the fire to raise ;
Possess what never sooth 'd the roman pride ?
Wherever now a sorrow stands , 287 .
The terrors of thy justice make me fear ,
The din of battle and of slaughter rose ;
Strange transition ! can it mean ? --
And courage grows where dangers come
What came of her ? the river flows
They have held you with kingdoms at stake .
But shall i own it ? the suspicious chill ,
Take heed , for love has piercing darts ,
Bitter his next words came :
Whom grown to manhood i despair to see .
And the bright clouds that circled the fair sun
Can all your wealth lost honour ever gain ?
Seeking the fleece and finding misery .
Startles then arrests the sight ,
By all those tears that have been shed ,
Was never seen again ! now it has passed
So make your home the brightest
Her eyes the maithil lady raised
Until it faded to a drowsy blur ,
Trams that run along with sparks ,
Health to emerge and joy , joy universal .
May form a spirit fit to sway the state ,
The chart of knowledge , pointing where it lies ;
I have no meane thy love to gain ,
Pitiful round her face that could not lose
And with fading must break .
Would that thy breast where so deep thoughts arise ,
Is busy balancing accounts .
Fearing her love will go .
" whose accents faint make the flowers rejoice ,
They touch the shining hills of day ;
't was mine to lose -- a savage .
All in one flash , his youthful memories came ,
He never thought on such to spend his rhymes ,
Then , darting fire from her malignant eyes ,
In the soul that looks on high ,
Who hopeless lays his dead away ,
An old saw runs somewhat so :
Where brats and bonds are held a blessing ,
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight ;
Love gives itself , but is not bought ;
Twice linked with golden scales the monstrous blow sustain .
High they raised the lord of features ,
Brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth
Shall hold the past but as a dream .
The more she courts the day 's pure light .
Only give them fire to light them .
And over my head the waves have met .
But as the jest and laugh go round ,
Wipes the tears from skies that fill .
When loyalty no harm meant ,
Thou art not lost as i ; for never here
Which quench 'd , then lay it up again
Fresh dittany beloved of wild goats lay .
He watched th ' ideas rising in her mind ,
And , afterwards , there came those marvellous days
The furthest barrier , stops the martial fair ;
And in his cell , when death drew near ,
Beheld a figure standing there that made his hair arise
Of joy that ever pour 'd from heaven .
A passing tear will rise ,
Only comes from my creator ;
Through the foam that seethes aloud ;
We laugh 'd at the fright she had shown
The tear that wet them kept her lids within ,
The flaming steeds that flash through heaven .
The wester came as steady as the trades ;
Of mountains , lifts his lofty crest ,
That mixed first by weight and measure meet ,
Of reticent withdrawal 's sweet , courted pale ,
Whose kingly look his princely mind declared ,
To lead the year was my appointed place ;
Shoots up with strength and rises into fame .
My cynic 's soul to _ shackles _ reconcile .
The tallest flower that skyward rears its head
Hope now has fled ; but in the fleeting past
As far receding as the tomb extends ,
Are violets washed with the dewdrops of spring ,
How philip put her little ones to school ,
Is blindly born to blindly meet its fate .
No riders push on through the darkness to win
And love hath turned homeward again .
And heaven gives a glimpse of its blue .
Has he not walls no human force can shake ?
Oft finds a poison where he sought a cure ;
That had held the pencil-stew ,
Pierced by the arrow of some foe ,
Bring less of bloom than in days gone by ?
Th ' unwilling life was gone .
With ease my happy fancies come and go ,
But the lark , in strains bearing love ,
Amidst revel and feasting , sad thoughts come ;
God sees great sin where men see least ;
And the sad gods with terror filled
And all those hard light hearts were swayed
Each minute be with pleasure passed :
My age has numbered only sixty-one .
The infinite , the limitless , laid down
It would go to needless combat ,
And with its many leaf-tongues spoke ,
Swift rush the spectral vapours white
Where all were false i found thee true ,
Regardless of the cost , he filled it ;
A transient pity touch ’d his vengeful breast .
For hope will brighten days to come ,
Long since th ' eternal piece is lost ----
A silence falls -- the ship stands still ,
But there and in the kingdom ’s bound
Old voices spake , old scenes recurred ,
They made you feel sure it would always be best
Each stroke directed -- but to enter thee !
I 'd rock in it nicely you see ;
At once their lives and liberties resigned :
Which marks the progress of each century ,
Beyond all measure ! his full faith was spent ,
To fruitful italy their course they steer ,
An end of everything that 's meant
All hope of life , conducted to my arms
Clouds swept the skies ; and the swift hurricane
With silver chains , that reach 'd their necks .
Where the government was laid .
Till billows rage , and gales blow hard ,
More than the most that ecstasy has taught
Corvinus asks : so come , old fellow ,
Who told thee thou wast called to death ?
A music not her own she brings ,
Until the weary lagging ship reached shore .
O father , touch the east , and light
Who gives command , and joins with tongue divine
The giants ' faces flying far along
Except the heaven had come so near ,
As one star with another star is placed .
In the well your charms reflected .
But none e 're fell in love with ruth ,
And when the same it hath gone round
Unto the last , when all shall fade ,
Shared the great woe that moved the rest ,
At night i sank contentedly to sleep ,
Note how the devil loves a jest to break !
Leaving a trickling dew . at last they shot
All eyes may see from what the change arose ,
And face the war it leaves behind .
" unseen of day , i let it fall
And my full thanks take for it .
The day shall come when this imperial troy ,
At wealth i grasped as a poor crippled wretch
That never looked upon man with desire ,
Sans body , give the vital motions forth ;
When hunger gives his rage the whirlwind 's wings ;
But every thought was lost in fear ,
They set him conundrums to guess .
Nature inanimate employs sweet sounds ,
And know , whatever welcome thou shalt find , --
The light that loses , the night that wins ;
Under the weakness of age thou art bending ,
Till it forms his character .
And quivered arrows cast a blaze
And these brave measures go a stately trot ;
That night the sky was heaped with clouds ;
The worm its golden woof presents ;
The embers , falling , make these soon ignite ;
And take the legacy i leave to you ,
From termagaunt his gem they take :
Of impotence in prayer so deeply chilled
Vainly they sought the frozen heart to warm ,
My death is wanting to conclude the night . '
Were my hands twined in yours , love ,
Faith builds a bridge across the gulf of death ,
Off went the skin an handbreadth all about .
Napoleon caught the fair
That have a double life , which thus is made
To join the souls of both of us .
That brings it near the infinite .
Its eye , with passion pressed ;
And the pagans are fiercely riding nigh .
Lived to bear witness to the living lord ,
As rough as the blacks had found it ;
Due reverence , and pursued his way .
And the dawn brings the fever chills ,
Sorrow thou ' lt lighten
Nor will jehovah hold you guiltless in
And full of war to his pavilion came .
The brute came crashing through my sleep .
To bring new gladness unto our dead ,
It is thy voice that fills
The humid wall with paltry pictures spread :
From the heat rose up a red boat ,
Has the war phantom blown upon thee too ?
All their eyes were fixed on glory ,
But dora bore them meekly . then before
The shifting sun pierces the young green leaves
Wherever rage can rouse , or pity melt ,
What means this maze of light and loneliness .
When love found words in flowers ;
Upon a shifting wrack of whitened bones ,
But greater cares sit heavy on our souls ,
Curly gold locks cover foolish brains ,
These leave the sense their learning to display ,
White faces seemed to peer .
And feel the films of sleep mine eyelids close !
Pointing to greater joys in heights above her --
From his magic blade flowed honey ;
These thoughts may not have risen that so keep
Thus the two made oath together ,
That all with mutual impulse tend to god .
Amphion once , the classic stories say ,
Thy pride has led thy thoughts astray ,
Of that which makes its glorious excellence !
Stands the revelation of his love .
I see you heave the frequent sigh ,
As balm to wounded hearts that weep .
The story gentle flordelice had taught ;
All hope of peace is lost for thee .
That the time might pass more gayly ,
Which monster made it first and next a prey .
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
Glared in the sky ; and westward came a blast
Would take a piece to cool the sweating horses
Here shall my craving heart find rest ?
No distant baying reached his ears :
With ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh ,
In swedish blood to wipe away their stains ,
No frost the summer 's bloom shall drive away ;
Upon his cheeks a lively blush he spread ,
Between high garden-walls that hide the sun ,
Eternal war with woe . who bears it best ,
Out of blood rise up new ghosts ,
Here sad ships lie which will sail no more ,
And the green-leaved tree responded :
By which a thousand ages were compressed
And many a wintry wind have stood
The fourth remained : then spake the king ,
And she made answer , knowing well each name ,
The persia i 've put in a song .
Weighs all the losses and the pains ,
To see afar , the light vibrating there ;
He held no wavering views , for truth shone clear
Now no more of winters biting ,
To whom from each the lord of lightning gives ,
All silent now , the choruses are gone ,
Cometh thereto ; and add the random rains
What 's passed between us . "
This past , the marriage knot was quickly tied
Where she , who kept a tender christian hope
I have always found eating a wondrous relief ;
Of cobwebbed years be spilled for him , --
And , deep beyond , the trailing clouds that slid
You chase the blue butterflies ,
The songs that other people sang . she took
The summer to its rose may bring ;
I was by love 's instruction guided ,
With lips made for kisses ,
No knowledge -- hold my peace ! . . .
For all his brain is issued from his ears ;
For it was not made for show ,
Men ofttimes come beneath a godlike form
It lies on my bosom now ,
The cradle -- went her ways , ...
Scrubbed till it shone , the day to grace ,
The sigh alone confess 'd the truth ;
How strength may serve for purity is shown
And fanned the secret fire , which through the day
Still followed by that arrow dread .
To whom the praise was given !
My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind ,
The deep came up with its chanting waves ,
Of retribution fiercely works in me . "
All night the red flame stabbed the sky
A sigh that piercing mortifies ,
Show me that eye which shot immortal hate ,
Whence jarring discord hath assail 'd it thus ? "
Cares i find , nor joys i miss ,
Pierces the aching temples it adorns --
A thousand years have borne us far
And all the ruin they had made ;
To odin 's greatest number can be given ;
I walk again beside the roaring sea ,
And thrice their sorrows and laments renew ;
While the trickling spring would have quenched our thirst .
Instead of nouns the pronouns stand ,
I hid my heart in a nest of roses ,
That brings to them only sorrow and death .
Rabid with hunger and with head high thrown :
Sounded aloud . the peal it blew had made
Which rendered him unjustly merciless ,
That always shows great pride , or little sense :
For which they claimed their sunday 's due
Alone he walked where the bullets hit ,
Tears fall thickly the while !
Might breathe the lovely music brought from him .
Linger we . hard necessity fills the foe
The snow falls deep ; the forest lies alone ;
Such changes wisdom holds of slight account
Rights that their pity urged them to refuse .
His approaching , sorrow follows --
This to the lunar sphere directs the fire ,
Small thought had he to mark the strife --
As one who in new matters makes essay .
We may not know how fared your soul before
His children -- followed them through every fate .
Fleeting forms that come and pass
If once his love be turn 'd into revenge !
When his visage had cleared , the heathen all cheered
With visage fixed and stern as fate 's decree ,
Then he fell to bitter weeping ,
But still he fluttered pulses when he said ,
Scarce wakened yet , apollo steals in light ,
They would work their evil mission .
Clouds of smoke arise to heaven ;
There stands the fiendly perverse spirit :
Dew-drops sing to the garden stones ,
They have not struck the roots which meet the fires
At noon i shall see waves flashing ,
Which heaven to gaudy day denies .
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me ,
Beauty through my senses stole ;
To feel the fleet foot growing weary and sore
It stabs me to the heart .
By thy day of anguish broken ,
Along the river ’s level meads they stand ,
That the rain may fall from heaven ,
I shoot unless ye answer whence ye stand . '
Free as the winds that caress them ,
Scythes that swing in the grass and clover ,
Shall spend eternity in hell ;
That wrought such grief for me .
Like waves that a hurricane bears ;
All places , as he lists , to fill ,
I wander 'd forth my sorrow to relieve ;
Scarce sixpence hath my charmer got ,
Thy pray ' rs alone can open this abode ;
The waters guard it in their crystal heart ,
Affection bends the judgment to her ply .
In strains that move the toes and heels !
The world is kept from scathe and harm .
Should fortune follow on a scheme so fair ?
And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds .
And i , stung almost to the very heart ,
You too moved joyfully
Let 's close it with a parting rhyme ;
That nature gently leads unto the grave
When steel and fire go roaring through your head .
The sea beneath him raged and swelled .
And the twain were casting dice . "
Or son , or bliss , or gathered store ,
Celestial equipage ; and now came forth
Beauty smiles , and love shall live .
And if some natural tears are softly shed ,
Sweet liberty is offered , as the price
Then rising fierce in arms , for war arrayed ,
Aloft convey the instruments of death ,
In spring , when stirs the wind , i know
Not in despair , to have found themselves not lost
Errands on which the willing feet had sped ;
About her heart , which seemed to shut its eyes
Of cloud we 'll take a yachtsman 's chance
In anguish they bow ,
Caused him to break the peace of kings ?
We rub clothes with a fate that hurries past !
To fortune ’s queen , with utterance checked ,
Didst make thy triumph over death and sin ,
To these his sceptre and his eagle add ,
But still he warms his heart with mirth ,
Thy ways admit no blemish ; none i find ;
Here comes another summer day :
When to the ships of greece came discord down ,
And to the latian court their course directs ,
And he gave him a mortal thrust ;
Old graybeards felt the glow of youth revive ,
Next , all which forth we squeeze is spread about
It gives men happiness , or leaves them ease .
He might have some improvement sought :
To bring them to a right repentance ,
Where purgatory its true beginning takes . "
Till the darkness falls around us ,
Towers and battlements it sees
And , giving it a nature which might suit
Has made the father of a nameless race ,
Never brought any colour to her face
These are the things that make me laugh --
The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky ,
That his artist-mother fashioned ;
Just a touch to try and off it came ;
And old unhappiness , long wrapped in sleep ,
Learn from fears to vanquish fears ;
But being there one feels a citizen ;
It can not fall loose until every link
And worthily his state maintained .
And shed around a glorious joy .
And science yet but sheds her orient rays .
They raise , a certain treasure for their toil
He would sometimes bring them sadness .
Thus would you make the world right ,
Without a fissure running through its joy .
And take the harmless folly of the time .
He added , ' lest some classic angel speak
What i loved best and made this book .
I wore , undreaming of relief ,
For it makes me a trifle tired myself .
In sharp contest of battle found no aid
Let it not share its predecessor 's fate ;
This put mr. frog in a terrible fright ,
And preparation made of noble cheer .
For error cleaves to all who live . ”
“ take to th ' infernal realms my offering bought
Single with like defence , wherever met ;
The term of love 's sad punishment declare .
By nature 's prophylactic forethought joined
To him who gave a home so fair ,
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;
Gold unto the mass he added ,
And , bowed beneath that word of god
From these our proud yet grovelling hearts
Granted such vision as hath wrought my joy .
Will soften when they see a woman weep .
Sleep on now , and take your rest .
Answered in the words which follow :
Advanced in view they stand -- a horrid front
Since reason sees but with the eyes of sense .
Of bartering booths spread out their tempting shows
Every year a stranger passed .
Edge beyond edge till all distinctness fails .
And hope gives patience for the race ;
And only find their safety in retreat .
Lo , from the brief delusion given ,
And they made answer in a murmur deep ,
It asks discretion ev 'n in running mad :
My butcher 's got a large demand ;
Benevolence i have not shown . "
With flying fingers touched the lyre :
When autumn brings around the day
Spring scents inspired , old wine diluted ;
She begged thee not to let it go ,
Of lurking treachery --
Again his pulses beat , his spirits rise ;
Cry , as they trace the meteor bright ,
" looking for a place to sleep . "
Then answered in a voice that made him quail :
He fills the greeks with terror and dismay ,
The first of these her hallowed feet had set
In death ’s dire coils already caught .
Next morning is ringing with birds that are singing
To share the human woe before thine eye --
There noon keeps just a twilight trace ;
Auxiliar to his son , ulysses bears
To watch the waters onward glide ,
Of fountains leaping in the shade of trees ,
Shall she kindle his fire like a coward slave ?
By nature , ne'er this poison sought ;
Contemplate here the wonder i unfold .
And in her fateful beauty found
The grief that clouds thy lovely brow ,
What followed would be tedious to recite ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
The river of time runs fast ;
As age comes stealing on ,
The wall that lay before it must be scaled ,
Descending , furrows deep the gloomy flood .
Answered in the words which follow :
Hath touched our very swamps with grace ,
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds .
Some one here has gone to sleep .
The past returns -- they feel
The simple remedy is found
The purple soul comes floating in the flood .
Around the tree i raised a nuptial bower ,
His steed is dashed to atoms there ,
Ambrosial shook , and the huge mountain reeled .
A wood-nymph binds with violet .
Forbid it , gods ! achilles should be lost ,
Lips that could draw the thunder on a throne !
The kinges moder there lay ,
And all thy heart lies open unto me .
While valleys wore the robes of blue ,
And now to conquest with like speed pursue ;
No ; europe waits the final blow ,
In very truth hath met with guerdon meet :
To wash my worlds of sins from me .
Dying ; and he lifted faint eyes ; he felt
“ the accusation heard : obvious you saw
The plaid sae graceful flung around her ,
I shall sink into the death-land ,
But his bed-time came too soon .
That greeted the musician 's lay
Her champion mounted for the hot encounter :
Let the wild falcon soar her swing ,
Can love for you in him take root ,
Pierced the sweet silence that it slew .
Thence what tidings dost thou bring ?
And out of his heart there falleth
Which may bring our sister to perdition ? ”
When death his cold hand on our pulses lays .
A senate that sits on the heights
To do one 's duty gives a smart ;
As more of goodness in itself it holds ;
And took the ring , and there awhile did stand
Who makes all nature 's chords resound
And fierce and wild his spirit grew .
And at the lifting of a hand sprang forth ,
Drink wine , that will banish thine abundant woes .
For pity let a tear be shed ;
A sweet contentment , felt , but undefined ,
The nightingale that in the branches sang ,
Her heart was fed with love-springs sweet ,
To get a load of gold to bear ;
A lion trailed along ,
That either profits , or not hurts at all .
There phillis held communion with the muse ,
Thank god the stars are set beyond my power ,
Rebutted . for criterion must be found
For the libation 's yet to make :
Then gave a look of sympathy ,
But truth comes weeping to their graves , and then
As if their passions in each leaf did live ;
The pattern grows , the well-depicted flower ,
And eros fired my eyes and lent my voice
How strength may serve for purity is shown
And make rejoice with thy wondrous voice ,
Like a fresh mortar trained on richmond 's wall .
Death is darkly drawing near .
Their hearts and ears did greet ,
Round the vessel twined a mighty serpent ,
And words fell soft as willow-buds ,
Till the evenings do draw in ,
Has found its home at last .
Bring back fond memories to me .
The cherub wings beat down the wind
Tho ' springing from a soul that feels
And the leaves are waving green --
To join the battle . so that banished far
On yon blest regions fix thy longing view ,
He saw that flood of burning tears ,
Through ever-shortening spaces , yet it moved
A shout of triumph mounted up thus high ,
The copses and meadows contain .
At present weigh 'd down by a doom which had
Their clothes sat on me with outlandish air ,
No fairies ride the cherry spray ,
They were not troubled by the wet ;
By gentle pagans filled , whose red blood ran
The old pain faded not , but swift again
Which joyous should have made penelope ,
It cries , " beyond lies god ! " ~
The love where death has set his seal
Which make the english climate of our years .
Has made me wonder if my brains are buttered ,
Was fanned up into actual burning .
When three nights had circled over ,
Saw the faint ripples touch the shore and cease ,
The snow-flakes tumbled and whirled in play .
Out of old graves arose the cry of life ;
There doth arise a sweet aroma
Within my soul , revealed eternity .
But -- his memory lives in the other .
Bound to no sect , no systems to defend ,
Carnage , and burning flesh . the lights shine out
And europe shall echo the glorious name ;
They shall live while the dreams abide .
And feel the sea beneath them sink and lift ,
Geologists do gaze with pride
Where thy songs will not be scattered
" daisies have i strung for thee ,
How the old steeples hand the scarlet ,
But in the onset come : so shall i taste
The royal seat they made me fill .
Their leaders heard , obeyed , or followed be ,
I passed to bright , unclouded day .
Error 's crooked pathways shunning .
For times to come i 'll make this vow ,
Them quick resentment stung , but him the most ,
Is the time for your parting come ?
Our hearts like the lambs skipped to and fro .
All in silver , housed in azure ,
I chanced from restless joy to move ,
Scarce fitly fashioned ; poverty was scorned ,
Sweet lass , you screw a lovely leer ,
Still canst thou scape the danger-lest indeed
And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away .
Aloft the name of womanhood she raised ,
That all the gods were chilled with fear ,
The singing soul that makes his soul sublime
" and darkness and doubt are now flying away :
Which tells me plainly i am all undone ;
Than seem 'd the heart i felt in you
And he paid no heed to the jeering throng
I have made the arm of the driver fail ,
Time spread his wings , the moments flew
Who bears the king our father wise ,
That some must spice and sugar find . "
When night came on , with blustering gale ,
With shout and roar the fiends draw nigh .
The beacons blazed , the banners flew ,
Looks o'er the waves that onward stray ;
And still it sings there day by day
To prove ourselves fit for the vote !
She hath not shrunk from evils of this life ,
That holds the hands that may not bless . _
Perhaps , turn out a sermon .
His pyramids on bases stand .
Then , bold assuming the vindictive ire ,
Failed at last , and her guile was wasted .
And searching wits of more mechanic parts ,
One spirit shapes the subtle rhythms of thought
Are tears drawn from its heart bereft .
A hallowed light came down .
To my cold lips the bloom crept back once more
Where dim delights are brightened into bliss ,
Love brought us to one death : caina waits
Now when all life is brought
Until the stale material will assume
Give me the moon when the passion is gone ,
By the great future 's dazzling hope made blind
The body 's life proceeds not , lacking work .
Misting the cabin fell . fair as the moon
The light is gone forever , and the dark
To show the gaunt world lying wan ,
And sin to give their work a name .
My heart seemed full as it could hold ;
Bind the sweet feet of mercy : poverty
To meet the glad with joyful smiles ,
The light of laughter went and came .
Let me be clipped of that heritage
Why so many matches are made here each season ,
And the sails soon in the breeze are swelling ,
Lost amid that night of dread .
Will bring enough of sorrow . "
Bending in homage and with offerings choice ,
Distrust doth enter hearts , but not infect ,
While the soul still looks through thine eyes ,
My naiads blythe the floating accents caught ,
For her heart in his grave is lying .
With all the welcome he can give :
That is part of the soul that aspires ;
Which to the stream the crowding people draws .
The storm broke loose , but first of all
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
The registers of fate expanded lie ;
Then round the queen in reverence passed ,
As suns through summer ether rolled
To make rude war upon the madman go ,
And joy coming now , like a sudden light shining
Sweet minister , pour out yet further the healing
The storms rasped at each cursing crowd ,
Pale , william sinks , with speechless dread oppressed ,
To furrow his cheeks , came strength to return
He veil his wrath , yet in his bosom pent
Ere this . with reverent eyes of awe they went
The incense of my soul was burned for you .
Of wealth and power possessed ,
These fears worked in my soul until i took
And round the horizon hung cloudlets ,
That pleading voice rose calm and sweet
And the breeze on water rocked it ,
Where the sweet flesh lay loveliest to kiss ;
Now to the baron fate inclines the field .
Let no man rule who holds his money dear .
To go on forever thus !
And paradise was opened in the wild .
The stranger cast a lingering look ,
The fire that played behind your face ,
I knew that one had made her thrall ,
In you alone hath lost his wings .
In kindly keeping with the good of all ,
Mysterious , that life pours for lovers ' thirst ,
Are lulled into sleep by the tide ebbing out .
And into its leaves and buds there came
It gives a very echo to the seat
In minds made better by their presence ; live
His weary eyes , yet little noted them ,
The conclave determined to make him a saint ;
And to his heavenly mansion went .
My gift the longing that me led ,
Your former fame to rival , or surpass :
" they scotia 's race among them share ;
That these things come to pass as i record ,
From all the pitfalls leading to the grave ,
O christ ! her substance fed thy growth : --
How swift the vagrant seasons fly ;
Exultant nature trilled the glad refrain ; --
Before the mountains heav 'd their heads
A south-wind blew , green leaves did rise
The evening passed into brightening dawn .
We , whom god sets a task . _
Can breed no vigour in the soul .
With him hath take manyfold ,
Who rides a dream , what hand shall stay !
With happier light the planets shine ;
The scheme ourselves have spun ,
And round his robe the shadows curled .
Say it surely will come true !
Their vanquished kinsman from the contest bore .
They sit in silence , then break into singing
And took communion from the holy one ;
This virtue nature gives her and this might ;
The vilest here may find a place , --
His profits on ' change showed a marvelous sum ,
And glorious dust that goes to dust ,
Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat ;
And made revel all the longe night ,
My horror , and in bristles rose my hair .
And faith that acts itself in daily life ,
I would make song , pure tones and beautiful ;
That careless all the heedless to it made :
Let me blow the dust from off you ...
And to my heart such kindly courage ran ,
To praise , to love , i find ;
Fill 'd full of sorrow and surprise .
That gazed back at me so gay and glorified ,
In every smile , in every tear that falls ,
His father drew , in silent joy ,
These fruits unknown , in thorny combs that shine ,
And here my journey 's end was sealed ,
And rode triumphant through the civil broil .
Nothing but gunpowder will make them stir ;
What form my dreaming was about to take .
To make believe that thou art gone ?
Dan phaethon -- so the histories run --
His heroism , to which nought replied ,
So pale grows reason at religion 's sight ;
Hid in the forest lay and fought secure ,
To thee whose kind heart feels for all . ”
Gay 's version of the fable is as follows :
The people 's cry ascended ;
Long lost to battle , shine in arms again .
Their genius has produced of rich and rare --
And turn the tide of conflict on the foe :
For she was beautiful -- her beauty made
These trees , whose gently bending boughs
A coward ’s hand their death-wounds gave .
That sic a couple fate allows ye
Which makes th ' experiment condemn 'd .
For everything that cold misfortune 's sought ;
Too sacred for even a thought that made free .
Now through the strait her jolly ship made way ,
Most unfeigned pleasure did we take in this ,
So the prayer-book teaches .
These sentiments were heard to pass .
My pain i could not feel .
Ere we reach the lisbon packet .
Shall see , how glorious once was thy attire .
Little care i how the gusts may blow ,
And there they brought their journey to a close ,
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears .
But thou , make answer , and in turn explain
And so at once will vanish my only discontent .
Thee i beheld , upon that highway drawn ,
All other comforts fail .
To save her from her misery .
And after all -- as those first sinners fell --
Nor find a hand to victory unus 'd .
And glory shone around .
" and makes the little planets run :
There came a terrible silence , and the mice
Storm-winds blew them to the northland ,
That i on its pleasures fondly dwell .
How much can come
Where he has left his sin-excited nerves .
Of that sin into which i now must fall ,
And all my fears at once like lightning fled !
The mountain sat upon the plain
Beneath , the peaceful camels lay at rest .
His purposes will ripen fast ,
Of towns and temples which makes italy , --
On this verdant lotus laid [ anacreon ]
He gave , however , to the kings and chiefs
To hide the fraud . at interview both stood
Where joys on joys forevermore succeed .
You set them dancing , these dead men .
The edge of the shadow never blurred .
Lest its former powers shall weaken ;
And you o my soul where you stand ,
But a lowly heart , that leans on thee ,
The dream that shall come true ,
With spring that thrills her warm blood into wine .
Shall bleed a victim to vindictive rage . "
Through the brass doors that guard the holy place ,
Go the southern braves to battle ,
Great nature through the flesh herself hath made
And his heart outran his footsteps ;
Her heart detesting what her ear allows .
And after his own image made .
That lay in the house that jack built .
May in peace be ushered in . "
It makes the parting tranquil
New years bring new happenings and fresh mysteries ,
Ashamed starts , and rises red
The ardent clay of me and make me air .
Became a clock , and still adhered .
And leave its odor there .
All this make ye : now let us flee ;
Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly . "
But cunning satan did not take his spouse .
Within , the fire to glowing coals had failed .
First singing they to their own music moved ;
Within the crystal , which records the name ,
And lost herself in the warm bright coiling dream ,
When it reached the valley far down below .
Which to discover we ride smiling , too .
The glory of his numbers lost !
My heart of thoughts that made it ache ,
And on the road he met with a rat .
Now made the stars appear to us more rare ,
" never shall men of mine take flight ;
Twitched to a smile , drake suddenly bade them crowd
And when they seek his doom ,
My dreams present you thrumming on your string
Time pure religion 's sceptre should return ,
Nor stygian prison house shall hold him .
Soft hands and lips that smite ;
Of precious spicery wafted with soft wind :
Nor this in open day had shown more bright .
To put into his letter . war supplied
He gives to range the dreary sky :
He takes delight in whipping cats
For the sensitive plant sweet joy to bear .
The willows shivered , wanly lay the snow ;
We dealt with books , we trusted men ,
And for this strange , this settled peace ,
Age needs not call her to vermilion ;
And misty grew her eyes , and slowly filled .
When rhymes came fast and blood beat clear ;
The cause that moved their strife he told :
Never give thy heart to grieving ;
It deepened down till it reached her heart ,
Such a boon to bring hath been given .
The growing labors of the lengthened way
Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom ,
My soul , tho ' dismay 'd and distracted ,
Surrounded by the works of silent art ,
Whom happy fate has hither brought ,
Tears for the loved and early lost are shed ;
Where the hills the fields enfold ,
Warm broke the breeze against the brow ,
I laid my own to beat ,
Now chilling damp falls heavy on our hopes ,
Far off the thundering surge of battle rolled
Against the king , a foul contagion raised
And the music the heart gave the tongue .
The little innocent soul flitted away .
And soft from silver clouds stole forth the moon ,
Memory 's echoes , murmuring after ,
Can grasp creation with a single thought ;
I will grieve and hold my tongue .
Of other beauty glittering thro ' the light --
All terrors cast , and death 's relentless doom ,
But god has given flight to me ,
Creeping shadows blur the gloom ,
Falls trembling on my spirit 's ear ,
Could warm the coldest heart ; that he so hard
I vow i came through pure good-nature ;
The powers that nature gave me ,
The weapons of rivalry gone .
The posture , that we give the dead ,
The power of battles lifts his brazen spear ,
Of this enchanted hill is tipped with gold ;
And flew until beneath her lay the sea ,
Love , who swayest this mortal breath ,
Of ways the puritan went ,
With staff twined round with lilies ,
Ancient chronicles have told .
Pondered a while , then silence broke ,
But fools do live and waste their little light ,
The leaves of memory seemed to make
To hold your life while others die ,
What made your eyes a glowing gloom of love ,
The great buds swelled ; among the pensive woods
My heart is crushed in me .
No kindred spirit caught thy sigh ,
Moved by the prayer of janak ’s child ,
Quelled anarchy within him , come to law ,
Fighting for passage , makes the welkin crack ,
But a voice his attention that moment arrested --
Like the mist that hangs on the morning cloud ,
That gave a foreign spouse to crown her bed !
Her masts are trembling from the shock .
His eye with instant animation glowed ,
O child whose glory fills the earth !
And the deepest place but reached its chin .
And it stands in the light ,
Lest his heart take fright .
The powers that watch 'd o'er mary 's birth
And those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom :
Can point the brimful grief-worn eyes
With shame and fear their bashful looks they hide ,
The faith that lives in joy .
You might be a hero to head a brigade ,
Thy thoughts belong to heaven and thee :
What mortal vineyards mean ;
As if it lit a land of dreams ,
Our country 's foes to expose or upbraid ;
Above us stretched the gray , gray skies ;
Their glance might cast out pain and sin ,
And abroad the peace of god was shed ,
Where justice reigns , though oft the unjust rule .
Is that a cloud that skirts the sea ?
I come not of that womb which hector bore ,
For the cold wave may bring me peace
And subtler meanings of what roses say --
For every empty window just aches with loneliness ;
' neath the iron cross that standeth
And sullen moods of mourning keep ?
The stars swing round us like a sun .
More beautiful than words can ever tell ,
Love rolls its endless volumes to the sea ,
And think of the sorrowful spirit that sings ,
He planned , and pursued his crime !
That round thee i my guarding arms might fold .
But sorrowing left the rest .
When a young footstep from the forest sprang ,
Her cheeks on which this streaming nectar fell ,
They went , above poor riches , gay ;
When peerless armies pass before his eyes ,
Their voice it made her ears to tingle :
Where traps for the white brides wait ?
A maid that comes to a look ;
Over sands and sedges shines the evening star ,
No music timed her parting oar ,
And conscience informs us we ought to be blamed ,
Give them the headlong winds to bear ,
Am come to share the task of war .
Tread out the names of the gone and dead !
But take ye all my counsel . send we back
And sucked by priestly cannibals .
Till word was given him of a knight
As i feel the sea winds blow ;
That on the margin grew ,
Undine has found a soul .
Giving as much of ardour as it finds .
How by that fair title came you ?
All this , love , i owe to thee ,
The laugh runs loud ,
But he found that guns would preach
Will make a journey -- to the moon . "
To give them to a maiden chaste ,
The book the angels foster --
But now to be made free .
Of dancing and hushed music woven afresh
There came whisperings in the wind :
Rage drops his steel , and storms grow calm ;
As the spirit song came pealing
Sullen clouds are gathering
And made a signal to retreat at one .
And the truth come tell to me , o. "
What should we doubt of the years that roll ?
Many a longing heart goes out to you .
Doth the east glad tidings bring ?
Doth fortune give ? what better hopes remain ?
Both covenants might see .
Answered in the words which follow :
" and with a constable pursue thy flight .
The motions of thy dancing limbs are swayed
Glory that shall for aye remain .
The organ , in whose tones the ocean rolled ,
Which wears the garland that shall never fade ,
To enter into battle ? on the right
What , sympathy , thy still returning pang ?
The wind cried frae the western airt
Thy worn-out heart will break at last --
Shall come not to the birth . the latin names
What mean those words that from him went ?
To gather pungent perfumes
And sat him equal in the land ;
About philosophy , pursued his jaunt
The prince as well as peasant finds a home ;
Of winter , whose sweet influence can bind
The spectral future leads its mourning train ,
See , how the ivy climbs and expands
" he chanced upon the costly dome ( as i
Him-seemed that footsteps drew anear --
And put it to the meeting then and there
Sing them fill the night expire !
And pressed his kisses on my head .
Fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove ,
Gently fanned by evening breeze ,
And scatters death around from both her eyes ,
Our lives went by together
Such pitying forgiveness lies ,
Even as summer my young days go over ,
Living colors he yearns to spread ;
But here the tear of sympathy shall flow ,
With them would bear comparing .
A curse has plagued with outcast ’s doom ? ”
And slowly sink to level life again .
Earth gets its price for what earth gives us ;
Adverse to these shall then in glory come ,
He showed how clemency should temper power ,
Into her private cell when nature rests .
The groups grotesque , on which the firelight plays ,
Angry grows , and much disheartened ,
“ wilt thou absorbed in pleasure , still
And budding hopes may never dare to grow .
Because you can show him your feelings .
Strains by good thoughts attended , like the spring
His life is ebbing fast , i see ,
That made all my life seem sweeter .
Which yet join not scent to hue ,
Then let the cheerful board be spread ;
They found the art of kissing through a wall .
Her soldier , closing with the foe ,
O liberty ! my spirit felt thee there .
Yon gay waters wind their way
Would that thy christian blood ran wave by wave
All valiant dust that builds on dust ,
That is each round shows more divinity ,
Kings ! whence came your right to reign ?
That 's the way the baby goes .
And take what daylight shows us for the truth .
His son deucalion bore successive sway :
Would make my reed-piped throat its choice !
Joy rose within her like a summer 's morn ;
We went our ways with too forgetful feet
No homer here awakes the hero 's fire .
That ever took wing , when heaven looked brightest !
Heavy with death unto the ground , yet made
When england knew thee thou wert passing fair ;
The leaves that make the softest bed :
Where faint sounds falter and wan beams wade ,
( as is the usual plan pursued elsewhere ) ;
Made the storms arise in fury ,
The excellence of mine lay that way too .
And lions raised their voice of fear ;
Yet sometimes tears must dim his eyes ,
Now we have drifted apart ,
Their conquering arms shall stretch from shore to shore .
Each stuck a nosegay on my hump .
" the lion 's anger to provoke
All the woe is stirred again ,
The moss that hangs from ruined centuries ,
To get what must be lost again .
It lets a man discover what he 's worth .
Within the leafy shade withdrew .
The sparkling waters moved the wheels ,
Did nága mother give thee birth ?
A wintry winter you shall see .
How should pale sinners bear the sight ,
The blank of lost identity ?
To raise with joyful news his drooping son .
Ere night her curtain hath withdrawn ,
Had with transmissive glories graced thy son .
And red with slaughter , leads the war ;
That gives nature to us , this
To shun what vertu manifest should make ,
To give that melody release
A chorus of approval roared .
That empire wilt thou now invade , light up
The summer comes with glaring heat ,
Show her how his eyes do turn
Of fancy rise full springing : but not mine
And query after query then arose ,
I took the wrong way . good and well ,
Little wings that flutter and beat
Crete 's guardian , minos , from which minos sprang
Follows the prayer , the readin ' next ,
A female generation rises forth
That nothing is got by this circular movement ;
To build a nation from .
From thine own darkness takes eclipse .
Then stormy waves rush on to drown ,
Adept in mischief , shifts it to and fro !
I do not wish to give offence ,
As shadows round us roll ;
He drew the mystic circle 's bound ,
Its night so well , you can not break
His weapon drove ; the brazen mail it broke ,
For headstrong youth will run his race ,
For great men 's fashions to be followed are ,
Of the steps that we took to one fiddle ,
The world shall find this miracle in me ,
I kin hump my back and take the rain ,
Christus and his disciples pass .
That giveth me the captain of the church
But answer got she nane .
Sheer broken down with hope and fearfulness ,
And lay down in her loveliness .
Heavy-hearted , long reflecting ,
But now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree ,
Dash me again into a wreck , my soul
That man was made the standing jest of heaven ;
For with the morn these sparkling glories fly .
The noble stuff of which his soul was made .
Such fulness of delight the list ' ner feels .
Methinks i feel new strength within me rise ,
No son her barren womb shall bear :
Of autumn , dropping fruits of power : and rolled
I held the keepsake which you gave ,
Wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch .
And instead of death give sleep !
Filled the evening star with music ,
A soul was stirred as one thro ' blinding tears
And the softest moss is spread ,
That falls into the dancing rill ,
Watching that no wild beast may scatter it ,
Thy beauty still shall see ,
They have not taken sympathy from thee ,
Wake ! for the hack can scatter into flight
A kindred rapture , and there came to her
Of despotism closes o'er our heads ;
Power from her very garments stole ;
In the faith that looks through death ,
Shall hence convey thee o'er the gloomy deep .
The lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven .
And a singing maiden , pitched her purple tents
And only loosed on slaves and kings
You led me to loving you more and more .
The room was hushed ; in silence rose
Thy question shows me thy belief to be
Their naval power in ruins lay .
Making death beautiful ,
Though oft i turn 'd the wistful eye ,
Wild send thee pleasure 's devious way ,
A robe about his shoulders threw .
On god alone , nor looked for other aid .
Low the chestnut trees were whispering .
And her hand went swift to her maiden breast ,
Has the hostess filled with wisdom ,
How he had kept them all from death secure
“ my sire withholds his eldest son ,
She giveth her whole soul to me
Through a circle that ever returneth in
There is a higher bliss than these , which fits
The trusty clans their claymores drew ,
This is the chain of venus that i ply .
That makes our language full and airy ,
Still the music sang of love ,
Above , below , the clouds would curl ,
The pitying gods themselves my chains unbind .
And , though it falls , continues still
Luminous , starry : earth can spare her not :
The aching hope , the trembling pangs she feels .
The bulls and bears together drew
Of trees and vines which on them cling .
Then they all rose up in fury
And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds ,
The wicked monster ’s life to take .
The armies fade , the lustre dies .
But still his fervent soul was filled with grief ,
And profit gained slower the longer would last .
War followed war ; from conquest , conquest sprang .
That runs a thingamajig to blow ,
When the pent heat expands the quickening soul , --
It made him whistle , it made him sing ;
And round about it ranged a numerous rout .
The stream went on its sunlit way
May one be pardoned and retain the offence ?
But what is that which gathers on thy face ,
The son of god goes forth to war ,
Brave sidney falls amid the martial strife ,
Close , and commit adultery with gold .
O fallen from thy virtuous state ?
With a deeper emotion than words can avow ;
That destruction may o'ertake him .
White sails lean along the waves leaping green .
He put the meadow in corn that year ,
If france was beat at waterloo --
Against whose base the white waves once leaped high ;
And the lily censers swing ;
And many a voiceless prayer was borne
And death in desperate combat sought .
Our memories play with yet .
Rejects the herb the leeches give .
Rose -- where thought rises when it follows death !
Great charter , with our being given ;
The breezes fetch along ,
And now the evening goes . no man has thrown
Past doubt her wisdom , taking from mad war
Your song goes ringing clear and sweet --
Its grasping greed no space can measure ;
By feeble hands the shallow graves were made ,
Logic is lost upon a knave .
For me and for the mystical end which lies
Thy power destroy 'd and scatter 'd see !
Which the pale moon throws on the silver stream .
And cold with blasts that bite and freeze ;
And full against the foe his chariot drove .
Like old jeff -- and they saw no need
O earth that leaves us ere heaven takes us !
Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm ;
Can not lose its vital force :
And the moody man devour it ,
The warrior rescue , and your country save . "
That made him feel on fire within .
But follow it , and make the wisdom thine .
The figure which the spirit lost , its skin
And kings the forehead on his threshold drew --
Light as entrailed blossoms , that shalt find
Now the spring is waking ,
Led by the lamp of my desire and woe .
When will ye cease our ears to stun
I found this quite a country quarter ;
The glory , that the wood receives ,
And one voice shall be woman 's , lifting lay
This mighty ship has taught .
For the sweet sound their speaking carries ;
The letters -- with their meaning -- melt
Become a habit , and we struggle , caught .
How other senses each their things perceive .
The hand that held the glaive ,
A purple mantle hides my empty heart ,
The rose adds its lustre --
Though thunder-clouds conceal the blue .
To think my strength is coming back at last ,
To keep their birthdays gladly , and with gifts
Bring the dawn soon .
Did we but raise our downcast eyes ,
Those faded eyes and filled them from the stars ?
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent .
And in the noon-time shadows lie .
Still shall the testimony here be found , --
He saw the skeleton trees show sky ,
We burn , where guns their frigates poorly guard ;
To dust and ashes , leaving nothing more ,
The ways were watered , swept and clean ,
As music dripping from the oar !
The evil can not brook delay ,
And seeing the king there stand , the knight
That love belongs to sin and death .
She fell asleep -- her prayers half said .
Where gothic pillars rise acanthus-crowned
This forager on others ' wisdom , leaves
Whence pride and power and shame were fled
Her thoughts fly back to the summer of life ,
Plotter of woe , for evil bred ,
As the still thoughts that summer twilight brings ;
His bright arms flashing like the gorgeous sun ,
Are the dear little covers that go
Instead of going to sleep .
No knife had curbed the rambling sprays ,
And all continued as they were made ,
For this with flute and pipe came nigh
And the stars above us their vigils kept ,
Thus you see what a brilliant alliance
From rainbow clouds there flow not
A flat it reaches ere it far has run ,
Where it injures to disclose it ,
He gives his girl a grand sleigh ride ,
All day the sound lay without motion , and clear
Through which aurora shows her brightening face :
And self-reproach is mingled with our woes .
No plaints find passage through unwilling ears :
But britain only , gave this reptile birth .
A life of luxury , till he had grown
My comfort stood : and the bright sun was now
And he spoke the words which follow :
At length from me her course she steer 'd ,
It 's friendship leads the way ;
Our maker knows , give him your fervent prayers :
Of that bright star to satan paragoned ;
His helmet here undid the weary count ,
Or guilt , that humbly would express
To enter the joy of thy lord .
Venus one day , as story goes ,
And the waves foaming and rearing in wrath
The magic car moved on .
While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound ,
The casket where my memory lays
Because his wisdom to the end could see ;
That stood in her dark stream of hair ,
How faith is kept , and truth revered ,
When her keel had touched the ground .
All rights reserved , including that of translation
To stand each test ,
In which the power of satan broken is :
Nor that black knowledge which pretends to wash ,
Next , proclamation through the camp was made
Where they lived , had sunk of late
That he is charged with being ill ,
And now their hearts must carry lust for love .
With pleasant liquours crowned : o innocence
Though winter is no time to get
Thou his image ever see ,
Dust of the dust that set my lover there ,
May not see the light of morning . "
The coming minute mock the one that went .
When from her active tongue he drew
Their wretchedness , held in the van ;
So that ere yet the vessel made the shore
That horse his mettle from his rider takes :
And to repentance and confession turn 'd ;
I 'll share the calm the season brings .
With candles burning to your lonely face .
Have got it one step from the starting place .
Wouldst thou bring ruin on my head ?
That o'er the sinking day steals placidly .
And deep attention by the church was paid
The sweat came cold upon his palms for fear .
The faults which so many could find ;
Not proof enough such object to sustain ,
And your heart contained no love .
Unwillingly the spirit fled away ,
Thou join ' st the woman to the man ;
Stronger thy chain than that which bound the heart ?
" which left my after-morn content ; "
Of nothing more than having good years to spend ;
And found himself with friends , and on his way
Where none but elders laid their head ;
It covers but not hides the sky .
Some kill their love when they are young ,
But thy sweet hills their green heads show ,
Unto my rest your spirits shall be guided .
So much of manhood 's strength his limbs retained ,
Like to the sign which led the israelite ,
Too heavy for mortals to bear .
Laid him down and took a nap
Lakes that fade to meet the sky !
Breathing revenge , in arms they take their way
I thrust through antique blood and riches vast ,
And through the house the wind goes rustling soft ,
That bore another rose ;
Ere that mine eyes had learned to weep .
To rise , and sickly drives a doubtful team .
Would now make her our chieftainess ?
That says " touch me who dare , "
It breaks in thunder and the whirlwind 's roar
Her going , with great rapture moved ,
Can bear a tale of joy exceeding mine .
Up flew the murmurs of creation ,
With some misgiving i go on to tell .
Their wealth they laid aboard , even all the spoil
The hands of holy promise , finds a throng
That makes amends for all the wintry past .
Yet ere that leaf shall fall and fade ,
And what i knew of marriage , what it means
The heavenly portals , guarded by the hours ,
If the taxes came in middling good ,
When they feel the pangs of sorrow ,
Wine gives wings to those attacked by melancholy ;
Their faith in moors , in him reveals
My spirit sent to join the blessed ,
And lays all tyrants low .
When ocean ran swallowing shore ,
By her whose heart the seven sorrows have pierced ,
All the strength that kept me up seemed drowsy ,
The gale follows fair abaft .
Nor feel the truths that sin sick hearts console ,
Her soul 's protesting sobs she drowned to swear
Drink the cup that life can give .
A being angelical stood in the heaven .
His hands let go the rudder ; a fierce rush
Pleasure that comes with sleep ,
Her veils of lies as they choose to shift ?
The curling ocean , and corrects the tides .
The path runs straight between the flowering rows ,
And the frosty winds blaw ,
By having his sad features shown
The tangled brake made way for him ,
A grove which springs through levelled battlements ,
Then to the holy groves which lay
To keep the victory gained .
The face that calmed the terrors of her dreams .
Dive again my tears to gather ,
Their dimpled hands must help to win .
The songs that i made for thee .
Where the most sprightly azure pleased the eyes ;
Joy she may take and leave us pain ,
Suspense now holds the mass .
A seraph 's hand extends a scroll from heaven ,
And a road my eager feet would reach ,
From his sacred pains made saddles .
A silent mystery that stood
That covers your heaven of blue ,
Out to the sorrows that drift by
You are upon the proper track , i find ;
His chaste house keeps its purity ; his kine
Beasts that have got a lurid past ,
Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers ,
The message burned bright on the heavenly scroll ,
A life of melody is rising here and there
Sister of all those whom my waves entrap ,
But ’ twas my sire who gave the word .
And scaly things their slime kept cold .
To free the soul from sordid tyranny ,
I find it the _ best _ of all .
And of our very nature form a part :
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;
Deep as the sleep that gave them birth
As that sweet ballad tells in plaintive rhyme ,
Hang sorrow , let 's cast care away :
Delay not : ere the western sky is hung
A color stands abroad
Strive in thy humble sphere to shine ;
Her fingers , and in trembling silence say ,
And when the clouds pass suddenly away ,
Moody and ill-content she eastward pressed ;
No choice is made of where it shall be thrown
Unto their innocent wings should virtue add ;
Has set his chimes a-going .
The pagans reared from their besieged hold ;
Our lives must climb from hope to hope ,
Closed not as evening wore ;
Gray the sails grow in departing
Torn my scare-net into tatters ,
Them quick resentment stung , but him the most ,
Glimpses i caught of faces that have come
Drawing to where the churchyard lay :
No mood which season takes away or brings :
They make an eden in her breast ,
That nature into being brings ,
The dew that silvers the dove 's wings !
He tried to button-hole the coroner
Open their wings that dream would follow fain .
Then gently fall on sleep ,
Your eyes , divinely hurt with tenderness ;
To raghu ’s sons a shelter gave .
Follows the prayer , the readin ' next ,
Yet is my thirst not stanched ;
Of rhythmic wonders springing from the ground .
As he went off , the clock struck four ,
It made him whistle , it made him sing ;
That cloud-banks borrow from the setting sun ,
To them at first he no reply would give ,
They took great interest in their beds ,
" by ancient ties of friendship are we bound ;
There fix , and shine a glorious sun .
And whither goes it with the failing breath ?
And the peaks looked toward god alone .
They give and suffer worlds of pain .
Blinds its eyes and breaks its fingers ;
Wast thou found singing when diana drew
What reinforcement we may gain from hope ;
To form a circle of such friends
And interchanged life unto them lent ,
That brave spirit comes again .
He found , ere death had met his feet
Your hearts will leap . her beauty passed the bounds
For private gain or hatred takes a life ,
Me mightier transports move and thrill ;
Fired with anger , threatened vengeance ,
It was so softly dwelt on -- such a smile
Made way , and a strange whisper surged around ,
Days brightly came and calmly went ,
Of the hopes in him we laid !
From me he took his sighs and tears ,
And not an eye thy form shall see .
Divinely through all hindrance finds the man
I may not let the sun go out . '
Few -- fronting the nations alone !
O even wings of music , bear my soul !
Deceived and blinded by the wish of vengeance ,
Obey the mute call and heave into motion .
And tender voices , to make soft the wind :
Hearing them give their idol the lance .
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell .
These northern scenes with weary feet i trace ;
Soon it gained the ancient rhine bridge ,
Till , eyes in fear peer at profounds
A smile to make my sorrows less .
Riding the sea , making the waves give place
Which taught me things unseen , unheard , before ;
Should spring from that pure mind and face ,
Takes from cats the right of singing ?
Respect and honour attend his path ;
There , where reply to innocence is made .
The mob stood , and as usual several score
The fiery pegasus to guide ,
" i heard the drops the water made ,
Violets make the airs that pass
Should we not hold it ? love wears thin ,
To leave this precious home you made in vain ?
To draw abundance from the sky ;
Love that made light as darkness blind ,
My soul shook shelterless .
My thoughts on former pleasures ran ;
Chill pours the hillside 's chilling flood ,
And timely guile unguarded finds them lie .
Which breaks the lingering echo of the tone
Unworthy freemen , let it find
The red cross nurses glide .
May on your wary footsteps wait .
Nothing was gone , nothing was changed ,
Its haggard look congeals a mortal 's blood ,
That without notice few full moons shall pass it ;
And flinching eyelids could not hide the view ;
Its spell must close with a crash
Which even up there unpleasant made its stench .
Might never further go than this .
As sinks the golden shield beneath the ocean .
The marble spire obeisance win ;
Hast taken all those angel charms ,
The funeral goes forth ; a silent train
It serves its purpose passing well .
I sent joe 's quart of cider spinning .
Made his heart yearn again , musing so wearily
By thy bright beauty was it newly bred .
Still it to silence , soften it to tears ,
Could bend to tyranny 's rude control ,
Whose memory comes with the scent of roses .
Saddened thoughts will overwhelm thee .
And oft the conjuror 's words will make
These years that kill and die ,
Filled the evening star with splendor ,
Which added doubly to my former fear .
And in the mouth ran soft and riotous .
Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue .
One rift of cloud the wind caught up suspending
To match his patience ' gainst her hate ,
The throbbing throat that sings .
The whole land calls for vengeance long delayed ,
Of memories that stay not and go not ,
Thus as ages onward go
Whence soon his arrows sought the trojan host .
And the day 's labour done , she takes
And rising night her friendly shade extends ,
And fill their fathers ' graves .
Come , read the meaning of the deep !
Both armies sat the combat to survey .
" whither shall we take this wonder ,
Seemed sad with glad things gone .
That vex distracted millionaires ,
His own , which he hath lent on trust ,
Shuddering because that evil thing had passed .
Trouble death to lay again .
Than his fame should suffer blight .
That driven by my spear to rapid flight ,
And she felt her skin was heated ,
The knightly lover , young hilario lay :
While flying shuttle threaded warp with web of beauty ;
And then she wept ; with that they drew
To ages following ,
And gives her gods companions of thy fate :
Now the charmed hour is gone ,
Go where glory waits thee ,
And once i sprang from slumber ,
That power comes full in play ? "
But she fell sick wi ' some decay ,
Her soul , that once with pleasure shook ,
Our homage can not cancel his regard .
The stage should yield the solemn organ 's note ,
O god , take the reins of my life !
Affection that shall match thine own . ”
To see the tears he shed ;
Its widening boughs the tree of knowledge shoots ;
The adornment of the court displays a rich
His goodness makes him dear to me .
And lend to the rhyme of the poet
Of tender , pensive thought , which made
Sure the church would bind a knot
Constrain 'd to dwell with pain and care ,
And into woe would turn my glee ,
The silent lips were proudly curled
Light that within them is , shall sharpen thine
All that was good , minutely brought to light ,
To eat up errors by opinion bred ,
Cold triumph ! first to make
Fruitful as vice the dread correctors stand ,
By sluggish oxen tugged to war ;
Nor the ghast sickening that comes of pain ,
According to the virtue it conceives ,
Was guided by their nod . and in the sky
The hum of armies gathering rank on rank !
Save failure only , seized me . evil finds
Since satan fell , whom folly overthrew ,
Still beaten by the billows green ,
We spread the sails and swiftly the ship plowed
The rocks of ice keep watch and ward about ,
His aspect , marked for early death ,
And with full lust those horrid joys renewed ;
Cast without cease into the beauteous source ;
Where want stood ready his fond hopes to crush .
That tried to blossom in the snow ,
No farther seek his merits to disclose ,
In distant wilds , conducted by despair ,
Thy name shall live while time endures ,
Now he lamenting for his folly stood ,
And their most righteous customs made me scorn
Feels no dread within his heart
The husband 's anger rose ! -- and red
To bar his passage fifty warriors lay ;
He made an engine , anyway .
And the tale that 's told !
That mockery of all justice , framed to cheat
But a short time passed thereafter ,
Strong in a cheerful trust that never fails .
No prayers were uttered and no tears were shed --
Because the sun has filled my dream with light .
Of the songs that sped the pulses ,
The words fell vague , i did not hear ,
It lit a chinese candle in his head .
But from mouth to mouth this tale did pass .
Mortuaries where warm should beat
As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised ,
Dante once prepared to paint an angel :
Watching with flaming eyes to seize your soul .
Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled .
That gave on a black passage . round about
A stately tree to heaven its summit sends
August brings the sheaves of corn ,
Ceased and earth fell , some vast strain ; --
The trial by market everything must come to .
The lights by which i sup
But now a wandering land breeze came
While terrible as death he pressed
And there it stands unto this day
A sympathetic chord is touched that finds expression there ;
Which made this lady grieve-a .
The ecstatic song of transience tells .
And silence . for no breeze may stir
To favouring winds the little sail was given ;
The sailors spent with toils their folly mourn ,
For heathen heart that puts her trust
Than vengeance takes in creed-taught minds ,
As more of goodness in itself it holds ;
When human rights are staked and won .
The brooks of eden mazily murmuring ,
And her fever-wasted frame could find no strength
Use all their charms to form a snare
So harmony grows full from many springs ,
They held the same opinions on the state ,
And heaven must punish on its angry day :
She found me roots of relish sweet ,
The morning planet poised above the sea
" make rodney assert he met the french fleet ,
With her sorrow left alone --
Was riding out on some freebooting quest ,
Saw the lifeless form extended ,
The war swept on and left it so .
Where precipices frowned and torrents ran .
In thee we press ,
Things and events lost ' neath an omening
Of twilight mists the sun hath soaked with gold .
Streaming with blood came the blind face of kit ,
The hand of life has cautiously concealed
For nature feels not any loss , --
Will bring you happiness . vashti , drink .
Arriving , found me weeping still , and still
Here loved ; that heart no answer gave again --
Uncouth , if only city ways refine ;
Which love had prompted , yielding scope
Thou wast not made to be a slave ;
The music that through sherwood rang
I will bear the battle 's brunt ,
For you no bound , no term is set .
Where joy climbs among the spheres
And to old memories clung ;
For this the month of may was made .
What charm yet fails them in the lovely place ?
Thy soul within such silent pomp did keep ,
Your sorrowful love can never be told ,
The grass that harbours them ;
To mend the fallen fortunes of their race
How joys approach when sorrows shrink .
Turned to exploding hiss , triumph to shame
Until it brought him to his woful end .
The settled clouds in ridges lie
By tales of fame diverted on their way
South-west by south they bore ) :
With misty auras drawn around their gloom
The scars of honour seamed his face ;
Something arose into his eyes and shone
There comes no rival to the rising sun ,
Of this and now of that the meaning sought ;
The oats of the harvest hung heavy and sodden ,
For me didst bear the cross and shame ,
The trees both fruit and blossom bore .
No wealth can lull to rest my fears ,
Stillness like that is dangerous , being charged ,
Thy memory will scarce remain with us ,
" now westward rolls the battle 's din ,
And long-remember 'd features shall return ;
And bathe your sad face in the tears .
And all love 's clanging trumpets shocked and blew .
Cherished the stiffened wounds and filled the veins ,
See that i am drawn to her even now !
My victories bring hosts , to whom shall fall
Refuse to let me snatch one cooling kiss
His fiddle to strike up a dance ) ,
In silence shed the sympathetic tear .
Mary , in whose fair name was laid
I pass 'd the tranquil morning of my days ,
Love , in exchange , takes nothing but itself ,
With reckless hardihood to meet their doom .
What fraud might dictate , or what force compel .
Gradually the feelings came back to my numbed heart .
As fell his plaintive voice upon the ear ,
Their lamentation , mixed with tears ,
There comes no rainbow when the floods descend !
Who makes us love the rival we would kill ,
Just as the opposing wind ' gins whistle off
To watch the fateful waves break one by one ;
Alas for love when love goes wandering !
Who reach their threescore years and ten ,
't was the truth that made us free ,
Of holy help , a sweet voice fell .
A doctrine that the priest had oft expressed --
“ in heavenly splendor shining . mild the maid ,
That he , had i made little more delay ,
But old , the mind with inattention hears :
The devil hath come down in wrath upon us ,
None could any likeness see ,
The broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears ,
To god and reason left the works they made .
How the moon makes the planets pale ?
I with that heavy-laden soul went on ,
Spirit of russia , now has come
Yet , by the tears those sweet eyes shed ,
Now the great winds shoreward blow ;
As life is lost in immortality .
I once was pia . sienna gave me life ,
Nor only i renounced the hate i bore ,
That we might years together spend ;
No farther seek his merits to disclose ,
Ideas are eternally joined to matter !
In furious gusts the fierce wind blew :
Of him who can direct such music .
Of a charged and marshaled sin !
Will she recall the eyes of brown
When calmly from the ocean rose
For lavish he showered those pearls that flash
The fair sun dropped ; then dashing ,
To some before his thoughts the shape he lays ,
Among the high rank grass that sweeps his sides
That doth unfold it , and this during still ,
Only give them fire to light them .
A whisper on the tumult thrown ,
Mine shall rest and linger
How much her panting heart confessed !
Which had with charms and herbs undone
But on its lips a smile was left ,
He 's there alone with green seas rocking him
He left the mountain breeze to dry ;
Move to the cadence of a song or prayer ,
Equality shall reign indeed ,
With eyes that shone with trembling glow ,
Eager ambition 's fiery chace i see ;
Shall their joys be turned to mourning .
Nor less the father pour 'd a social flood ;
Higher still the wall shoots upward . "
And when it comes unto an end
The smiles that from reflection came ,
Treasures the tears that his striving ones shed ,
And with his words unfolded nature 's source .
John gave the keeper two whole sous ,
Lining the road where the legions roll through .
To bring the whole world to its mood serene ,
That makes the universe resemble god .
Raised a heat as sweet as honey ,
That opened oaks on the uplands
And envious age forbids an empire 's weight .
In rhythmic sounds the antique numbers gave ,
In such a mansion , as scarce thought finds words
Love will make our cottage pleasant ,
Shown resentment at the outrage .
Bending , recurved blossoms of the storm .
And the lilies lay as if asleep
Which covers the renowned magician 's mould .
Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
But no boy knows when he goes to sleep .
And the hard frost destroy 'd the scenting days :
When liberty and truth shall reign for evermore ,
A moonlit path hemmed in by beds of bloom ,
Then the emperour to him this counsel gives :
With green trees shadowing the tranquil mere .
Was ruled to be inept , and set aside ?
Leading to the northland-treasure .
If gilbert upward turned his gaze ,
Arcadian sights then hold sway :
Yes -- let them pass without a sigh ,
Praising his god , but answer made he none .
Jason , lost on colchis bleak ,
And kept the promise that he made .
Swift daylight of their splendor and made blow ,
While the drums roared and rolled and beat
It sounds as it might tell
Hard he struggled his way to win ,
If the first scene is murder , what shall follow
Spring and daisies came apace ;
Hast rendered me security , and drawn me
Against the poets their own arms they turned
For the sky hangs heavy with pain ,
Which their sad young faces wear ;
The yellow honey fell . but , saturn down
The deadly grief that knows not cure ,
No hopes console or fears betray --
Whence heavy persecution shall arise
Dearest , thus we 'll join the two .
For nature meant that man should share
And the system projected , monopolization ,
Whatever it creates and nature makes . "
When o'er chaos moves the breath ;
As if some cause of sorrow touched them all .
And yet but little came of this ,
" and love will last as pure and whole ,
' mid the strife of the boiling commotion ,
To let thee share its grief .
Who works -- gives blessings and commands ;
Then like a film runs into sentences .
As a groan from jim his agony told .
Of priests , whose reputation had spread wide
And custom lie upon thee with a weight
Yea , swings the incense that for god is meet
Have found the peace of god beneath a spreading
The world takes sides : whether for impious aims
When thy merry step draws near .
May serve to put thee still in mind
That opened on the golden gate
The lists were set in summer 's view ,
And patience , which at last shall overcome .
When cooling shadows creep along the grass ,
Some small repose his fainting spirits take ;
Rioting they pass --
" but , as the matter stands , instead
Whether its music rolled like torrents near .
Now in view the dingy walls stand ,
There came a clapping as of phantom hands .
While sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves ,
Which glorifies a shadow and is gone .
I will await you when the sun sinks low ,
Who caught the eyes of waves forlorn ,
His sorrow gan assuage sooth to say ;
I made a wish that i might feel his kiss
With one wing she sweeps the heavens ,
Cold memories shroud our life ;
The singing waves slide up the strand ,
Or are you bound in sleep , my love ,
The saxon rears one shock of grain ;
The portals we straightway will bar .
To waken the theme of my praise ;
As he lives who through perilous paths must pass ,
In the canto that shall follow .
I lay my face before thee in the dust ,
Of business , and minded to breathe the pure airs
Towards the housefronts on it comes .
Yet faithful to its trust remaining .
A great , round moon rose over a hill
Enjoy the comfort gentle sleep allows ;
I find her spirit 's fragrant influence rife ,
While from their wrinkled foreheads runs the sweat ,
Work ? without work prayer does not help .
A stream crawls through its tawny banks ; the hills
And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament :
Pushed from her faintly want and sin .
And quenches their innate desire of blood :
She made the catalina jealous ;
Struck by the oars gave passage to the fleet ,
A sort of frowning survey of him took :
_ no fame that wit could ever win _ ;
The sun was gone -- yet heaven knew
And when the vital breath is forced without ,
Close to the works their rigid siege they laid .
Faded the angel that had saved from sin ;
The sun hung centred overhead ,
Fears not that evil accident can rise .
I trod the paths of love
And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage ,
Polished their steel and joined the stout crusade ,
If you listen to the river as it rolls .
" no mercy shall it find from me ;
And silent horror glares in ev'ry eye :
Tho ' your pen be dipped in gall ,
And drown the flutter of first-breath ;
How late it grows ! the hour is surely past
From whom the answer came unto these words ,
Were arts the gods made grateful to my mind ;
And gives the rivet of eternity .
Now spring has come , my dear ,
Which when that heart of malice heard , it took
Only set them afloat
Her gay looks told my sombre mood
And well prepared by ignorance and sloth ,
And finds too late that men betray , --
They go in whirls of light
Bright walls of steel about its summit go :
And he a wave . joy , tingling , crept
And a smile of scorn went round the band
Round , round , the roof does run ;
Lapped in silence lies the house of dying ,
Where no disease reigns , or infection comes
And all thy sorrows drown .
Shone , and she stretched her glittering sceptre forth
About this time , so runs the story ,
And that 's what makes me cry !
Where the sunlight flashed -- where the shadows lay
They watch the stroke before it smite .
The brook passed several days in anxious expectation
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
His neck and feet continual journey made .
That list ' ning heaven consents to save .
Where the pines , like waltzers waiting ,
But the cheerful spring came kindly on ,
The swallows darting .
Save that which moved him to maintain his truth .
Whence doth come that trumpet-blowing ? "
Not yet the round clouds of the maytime cling
And bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood .
Lo ! in this hollow cradle take thy rest ,
" such joy that swings and flies
And every little wave took its nightcap off ,
The laws of nations bid my tongue be bold .
Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses ,
I give to baser life .
That lay in the house that jack built .
And lips could shape , in prose and rhyme ,
Adown the broadening eastward lawns , which lay
And sorrow 's faded form , and solitude behind .
The hills take colour , and the valleys sing .
To pluck the steel , and follow with the spear
When pinching cold our navy binds in ice ,
That lingered in her words and true design .
A name that tells of a splendid part .
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
I have attained a second birth .
Which scipio the heir of glory made ,
With lighter probe or deep , touching the faith ,
To shape from music and the scent of buds
Luridly glaring through the smoke of war ,
Beneath dark skies where vultures lay their course ,
So loved , their practice does but say ,
I was at peace , and inclined to spoon .
Each leads ten vessels through the yielding tide .
Round his meek temples cling ;
And fell asleep : and while she slept ,
My full-flush heart streams come and go
On the sombre rafters , that round him made
That keeps , till june , december 's snow ;
Deliverance must be found in god ,
Makes conflict sublime .
Your lofty sovereignties ordained of old .
Thou seest me as time who kills ,
I fight the greatest pugilist
But silence steals the song .
But that success attends him ; if mishap ,
O faith ! that wants no form ,
Pillars of silver , channels pouring from the east
It breaks my heart to hear him now ,
To gain the world for christ , tho ' we
And such his lips that called the light by name
Shall meet one atom that was you .
That shed sweet yellow through the thick wet red ,
A charge that fills the ashen azure sky
Is were stern poverty assails the man .
He knew no law that dared call beauty coarse ;
Time passed . john tried his grief to drown ;
And i passed him a cheery word or two ;
Who held preferment in the north _ -- }
And my tired mind felt weak and blank ;
It goes . for me it doth not care --
To guard his shaded face from scorching sand .
And found no welcoming cheer set forth ,
She mingled with a smile a tender tear .
With globes of fruit that like still planets shine ,
Rise up , my sovereign , dost thou see
And still her tears ran down .
Which left this spot , the battle o’er ,
Unvisited , on which the fire had seized .
And every line you write too plainly shows ,
Up , your banner leads the van ,
Another tale the coming day would tell .
And laughter fluttered through their after-talk ,
And curbed the random rivers running wine ,
To black oblivion that would cover all ! --
The very stones his truth would teach .
They tied the tribute to their spears ,
The seeds of treason choke up as they spring :
We took the road aye like a swallow :
The golden sun doth shine upon
You can rob of terror every word we say .
How our reverent passion rose ,
And forth to sea made lucky speed and way .
Now if she 's lost my heart must break --
Seems to make one suffer the more .
Could train her offspring to the skies .
But if thy soul can bear the shame
Of love , than ever books could speak before .
Greatening and darkening as it hurried on ,
An odor of incense filled the air ,
In miracles that baffle if pursued --
Whereby this happy change upon thee fell . "
When snowfalls come in flakes of jet ,
Angry grew and sighed for vengeance ;
A long bright hell of choking cold ,
Where erst it stood , terrified at the sound
With victory , the olympian heights regain 'd ,
Who shall now the tidings carry .
Must they have stopped their hungry lips
Win back her fond embrace ?
The fight then went i to begin ;
Firmly to set his teeth , resolve his mind ,
Of death , and dubious life to come ?
Who might have shared yueen 's imperial throne .
I fly from petty tyrants to the throne .
That choke the issues of eternal love .
Then thus her anguish , and her passion broke :
When nane on earth can ken .
Of waves that waited round her for her kiss .
I thought the news must have reached here --
Each felt as brave as any sparrow ,
The essays here brought together are meant to illustrate english
Then find in it thy own delight ,
Or wild mad schemes upreared .
When all the world then knew of war
Through their green gates the sunshine showed ,
The sky droops low -- and many a bark
A power has gone which nothing can restore ,
How could he know a hope died then ,
Where the tamil and malay tell their lore
Wept as the broken earth closed o'er thee ;
That man with a secret horror fills me .
Nothing has changed since her spirit departed ,
Though by olympian jove himself upheld . "
The army he would rally , as it runs .
Which did as nature give the human breath ,
Where winter-long the snows have lain :
Flaming fiery tongues now glided
Where earth enfolds me to her mother breast ?
Wherefore hast thou power thus given ,
Instinct with light whose sweetest promise lies ,
She seems to stand with sombre locks
Her sandals kissed with seas of golden grain --
Their merry wakes and pastimes keep :
A little trade best fits a little toil ;
My heart is broken and mournful
Wave rolling after wave , where way they found ,
The tea went round . after five cups
But they fall silently , like dew on roses .
His wisdom drew the plan ;
Following the rumor 'd voyage of the greeks ,
Where the great wall round china goes ,
Wherever there is aught that power has made ,
The poetry of childhood shown ,
Hell 's freezing north no tempest can send out ,
The wind hath blown a gale all day ,
The tides of darkness whelm us round again
Is frozen and beaten to harsh old age
Yet in those few our hero pleasure found .
And the clan went mourning all the way .
This said , his eager javelin sought the foe :
The scripture ’s holy texts explain ,
His lilies newly blown ;
On board , the trojan found more easy rest .
Tired of the scenes that nature made their own ,
Never must join the conjugal embrace ;
And all the village holds them in respect ,
And the troll hill rose on pillars tall ,
The evening mosques were brushed with gold ,
For the signal they know will bring relief ;
Of life long since has anchored by thy side .
Came the spring with all its splendor ,
To share each other 's dew ; --
That threw a second bridge to reach
So this vast crying sum draws in a less ;
On which it stood ; great changes have been wrought
So there was silence ; such a silence broods
For gothic daring shown in english money .
Could raise the breath of song sublime ,
Was put at last in execution .
As made us nobly wild , not mad ;
O painted monster , formed mankind to cheat ,
And hence the sources of diseases come .
Aye , we will follow the flag
And lead my soul to the feet of god ,
The next day i found him happy ,
Vanquished must fall on the unfinished page .
No rumblings rose , no thunders crashed ,
What tears the widow 'd lady shed
Wealth can not make a life , but love .
If all be true yon standard says ,
Troy and her aids there set the battle forth .
As my heart caught the knife :
Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies .
For tarrant moss holds them in trust ,
She spread her dark sails on the wind ,
Back , as a hand that pushes through the leaf
The songs that make her grieve .
The sea sucked downward to its depths , laid bare
At trap , it came to pass
That from this garden climbs to kiss thy lips .
Instantly all with hearts that sighed
Than ever lightly-kindled straw took fire .
Day after day her tears were flowing ;
For meat , shall give thee melody .
May in time convenient find measure for measure ,
Comes a lisping little beauty ,
More fiercely will press on . so ours shall be
And meadow perfumes pass ;
The cheek to thine i fondly lay ,
At this voice saw i many little flames
The sombre note that gives the chord its power ;
Hastens as the dawn is breaking ,
Laid down his life a rebel world to save ;
And with my presence fill some vacancies .
Our countless wounds that pay no debt .
From the void abyss by myriads came --
Then from amaze into delight he fell
That by my side he may pursue his way ?
The piper 's face fell , and he cried ,
The music stopped and i stood still ,
And as she fetched breath , away he skips ,
In ocean 's stead his heart to move
And cold the sun does burn .
Which when i saw , i made access
As running brook passed by the pleasant hours ,
Thou to whom all my powers belong .
No wail goes up as hector falls .
As clean as april showers wash the dusty plain .
Shall build vp thy triumphant browes .
Yet who had sprung to life 's full force
Stalk , not shrinking abashed from the dazzling glare
On the foundation which is laid by nature ,
Fighting for spoil it battle lost .
But when they spread their wings
The lances stayed not in the wounds they make ,
Silent she went , nursing the grief that kills ,
This question put i ; and he answered me :
Love went ; and left no shame .
To loving arms that rock them all the night ,
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn 'd .
Which offers slight employment to the speculative mind .
Where blown by tempest wild the vulture screams !
Except when england mounts the car .
Eyes and lips expressing sadness ,
After my father 's death it saw the day ;
These from thy source the fires of freedom caught :
Half choked with rage , king robert fiercely said ,
But wisest fate says no ;
Repentant of his deed , was touched with fear ;
And these made rulers ; -- full sure ,
Are your sorrows hard to bear , 253 .
And thoghte put hire in an ile ,
Chrysanthemums unfurl to-day ,
The robin sang love to his shy little sweetheart ;
A sound oft fearfully swung
He instantly recalled the name ,
Had placed a royal feast .
In pomp sits mercy seated in her face ,
Let blessings lost being consecration ,
Dread battle-prowess swelled . for conflict grim
And clasps an essence in the soul 's embrace ;
For still that dim unmeaning happiness
The assembly sat , their song uplifted ;
Need a hero filled with valor ,
Where all , even horror , to enchantment turns ,
“ but where is he , of virtue tried ,
So that the blood made horrible his face ,
On sundays and when daylight wore :
The silence of worship broke the mother 's sleep .
When curses wander ’d to and fro .
While , by my love and duty led ,
She poured her love upon him , lit her soul
Cleansed by a love that is mighty to save !
If he lost his gaelic !
The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine
Shaped and transfigured in the sunset glare .
Are infinite , and can not be exhausted .
Has given the sign for you to see
Her reputation stained by slanderous lies
By guilty gods , more fell his foul intent .
Quickly before me runs the quail ,
No blood from bitten nails those poems drew ,
And the moonlight flowing over all .
They see , nor understand the joy they bring .
A hundred waterfalls , whose voices come
Vice with such giant strides comes on amain ,
Love brought us to one death : caina waits
Strange kind of arms in single fight to bear ;
And dead wings carried like a paper kite .
And humped his back and gave a squeal ,
To wrong the wronger till he render right ;
The banquet on which hungry flames love to dine ,
And now was dropped into the western bay ;
His work dishonoured , and our glory gone !
That wander through the blooming heather , "
So justice o'er his mind held sway ,
Vainly wouldst thou , to gain a heart ,
Thinking by dying to escape disdain ,
Rippled to ring on ring of melody , --
As may be shown by a simple calculation .
Your court fro this day forth to serve :
What time apollo 's chariot takes the skies ,
When the mist is weaving and drifting .
Only keep the ragtime playing to the end .
To the ship that is waiting for me .
Beyond the sob that stilled erinna 's voice .
That bound the order in strait brotherhood .
He paves the pathway to a higher goal .
That makes old emptinesses stare in wonder ;
Take the training or the task
To this city joy reveal it !
Rebellion roused , revolting ramparts rose .
Edgar allan poe put it this way :
From her , might save the universal ball .
And the moonlight flowing over all .
The roystering west wind flies to greet her ,
Dim the sweet look that nature wears .
Which take the better way of faith and life ?
Grew we not weary as the days went by ?
Who finds her own in his delight ,
That smiles as we draw nigh ;
Before the town , a solemn feast had planned
The self-brought woes his people feel ,
But i turn from sighing back departed passions ,
Or raise old warriors , whose adored remains
It fell about the martinmas ,
With miser care possessed .
Which i hid of old time in the west ,
Thus solemnly doth pass the vernal day ,
And casts his haggard eyes around ?
But he our life hath left unto us free ,
Turning to horrors ere they reached the best ,
The waves beside them danced , but they
Takes form in moving , and becomes a world .
The strains pour forth their magic might ,
If men procured thee trouble , gave thee rest .
Which lived but to reflect her loveliness .
His spirit heed , still winged with golden prophecies .
So that no single breath of air may pass ;
In angry heaps provokes them forth .
There lie the mightiest passions , earthward thrust
Foe after foe pressed on ; yet not for this
In the other chap 's hold , you see .
What leaves the wind in winter tears ;
Of life will find you leal , unweary
They will follow thee and slay thee ,
Lest thy heart with anguish bleed .
We owe it to you that our banner ,
The modest _ rose _ , whose blushes speak
To zeus 's mansion , and sleep swiftly flew
And want doth follow fear ,
To break the bonds which on me lie .
Condemned to bear the second death ,
And there on a reef we come to grief ,
Would give a pang to jealous misery ,
( books fit only to hoard dust in ) ,
A trembling seizes me , tears fill mine eyes ,
It almost makes me cry to tell
Three , unto whom the whole world give applause ;
The sun throws his ray on the lake ,
The troubled torrent fills ,
To read my fate ;
With his own priest to lead the train ,
Have struck our souls with wild dismay .
The drowning struggled and cried ,
That such misery could follow ,
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven .
Both leaders : you shall spread wings again ,
Or set sorrow in our way ?
Again reveal the mystic hidden rune
And yellow lilies islanded in light .
And would have shown capacity to shirk ,
Great treasures follow through my care conveyed
These now discarded scabbards hint .
Brutes with whose screams the trembling forest shook , --
E'en human love will shrink from sight
In thee the root , o angad , lies
And some in logick sought repose ;
Of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams
To feel yet shrink not from its pain ?
For i am filled with perfect joy from it .
That i in blindness wandered from my path ;
Who has fallen in the fray .
To bar the strife he spurred .
Or of the vain who simple speech distort ,
The odour of ether hangs ;
And love came gushing from her heart ,
But what her arts develop this and make ? "
Though years have passed , and time has strown
The autumn of the third year came and went ;
Round reef and rock ice casts its chains ,
And seeks to serve the cosmic soul . i think
But even shakespeare 's text hath had its day .
Where tired eyes might fall asleep ,
And creep across the coffined years
Until she pity moved with mournful mien .
This age may decay , and another may rise ,
And all my heart 's fresh sorrows bleed !
The heart had fastened of that fairy-queen ,
But i 'll not be seduced by phanatical charms
This gift receive from the pellaean king ,
The shorter life , less care i find ,
My mind dictated . moments rolled away --
That spread through all the circuit of the skies ,
The hall maintains its rule of the village .
Up at his attic sill the south wind came
Should less than gladness bring
Fire-filled the flesh . its light still stays
Thence to their images on earth it flows ,
And how his madness went away ,
Unnotic 'd tinkle , and the reapers hung
That climbed to touch the silent whirling stars
That god 's richest blessings may compass your way .
That glassed the birds of paradise --
When the supper has been spread .
With sails like blossoms shining after rain ,
Show the huge blocks that face the height ;
That holds the memory of her face .
And greater force to give it act .
Or give thee cause to comfort or to bless .
Saints shall find the promise true ,
Now their broad black beaks they lifted ,
Some random truths he can impart ,
Life 's battle waxes hot with men .
He rests contented ! with these ministers ,
Her flowers admired , and begged them too :
And find you happy there ,
And what till then was fury turned to art .
His counsels and his life proceed from thee .
Shalt find acceptance , for a while suspend
To see a better day . at eighty-four
Nine years have risen and eight years set
All are lost ! -- yet still they bear
In the air the smoke ascended .
The mountains ring , the valleys answer them .
And moss , that glows as fresh and green
( to shine in darkness only being made ) ,
Which whirling ran around so rapidly ,
No help his life could save ;
He smiling said , " for you i feel
Or clouds will shadow my domestic sky .
" since wisdom 's sacred guidance he pursues ,
" art formed to make both hearts thy own .
And all creation to him subject laid .
With fame in just proportion envy grows , 40 .
Which to his table brought good cheer .
Green as the herbs on which it couched ,
" lastly , together went the reverend pair
Stamped in my brain i can make manifest ,
It comes to pass that those primordials ,
Of wild waves dashing on the shore .
Eternal life -- a river gulphed in sands !
The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood ;
They make his sleeps light , and soon past .
Is slowly trailed the slime of crawling toads .
In what he gives to thee , this paradise
When poppies flare and lilies smile ;
What secret woes lay close immur 'd !
Of water sucking the hollow ledges ,
His wonted strength his frame forsook ,
There rose a shriek as of a city sacked ;
Soon , not surprising , death his visit paid .
To unlock the heart , and let it speak ?
Unto my heart has come that season ,
The gliding lethe leads her silent flood .
Rose slow in awful silence , laying bare
His noble heart in his full bosome bled ;
Roses rise above the lawn .
Hobble the ponies , scattering in affright
Where none but elders lay their head ;
And love he had and made good cheer ,
Of waking life ; the streets were stirred
And every tree that wears for her
That kissed the maiden all forlorn
No craving void left aching in the breast :
Now are thy doors closed upon beauty and joy .
The road that thou hast gone .
Each lifted up her voice and cried :
Have given the maxims that you follow .
For everyone felt assured that he ,
Nor can peace to my spirit bring lightness ,
' where cares molest not , discord melts away
But a flower struck root and grew
And as its ruling power he felt ,
The gods by earnest prayer prevailed ,
Dudon pursued the victory he gained ,
I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure ,
And the moon has left her station ,
In rapture of triumph charged the amazons ,
And raised her fainting from the ground .
Now when the dead man come to life beheld
The night came down , with quiet stars ,
For i felt the shape of the shade
Of the left wing that held the utmost marge ,
A tribute offered wistfully
There fell a checkered beam of moonlight , shed
Spring , glittering with the cheerful drops like dew .
As if even now she felt at heart
Ill understood , which there is shining through .
He shook two spears , and challenged to the fight
Twelve others followed -- costly loads they bore ,
To the threshold brought him safely .
And all the miracles your heart contains .
As the seasons come and go .
On the long lashes hung slow-gathering tears :
Of still and serious thought went round
Thy fair words make me suspect thee ;
Little enjoyment he finds in going about among others ;
With him that doth all heavenly hearts inspire ,
Should raise him to your throne .
The wind that sweetly sings in ocean caves ,
And we departing left them to that broil .
And that will make you cooler . you will find
And on it shone the gift he sought ,
Then wherefore mourn the wreaths that lie
And honourable wounds from battle brought .
And soft airs fanned the hills , i knew again
And yet the spark of manhood still flamed within his
One lesson which in every wind is blown ,
In which the bitterness of theirs shall vanish ,
From heaven pronounced him his beloved son .
And imitation marks the mind of man .
I ’d follow this music wharever it went .
To share the common doom .
And see their little clearing there expand ,
Back to his pondering soul was brought
Their churches made of god a battle leader ,
And here alone he 'll disobedience find .
T ' take th ' kick an ' blow ?
Has cleared the babe , it bears the stain
Light have ye still to follow evil or good ,
And made the subject of a jest .
But faith has eagle eyes unsealed ;
Now strong as youth , magnificent i tread .
The seas run high and the boats split asunder ....
As far as the whale-ships go .
What hast thou found in the spring to follow ?
Us too he bids our oars and sails employ ,
Read here how wealth aside was thrust ,
Returning virtue brings back glorious light .
Earth being only made for queens and kings .
My sight , that followed her as long a time
A mighty trembling seized his frame ,
Moving my spirit past the last defence
And witty arguments with mirth pursued ;
The rose aroma filled the lane ;
The crimson bud , the bloom full blown ,
Thy stars , in circles onward hurled ,
In softest murmurs flows the glassy deep ,
To save from his unerring bow ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
May butter always turn to oil ,
Crested with silver ; and the breezes play
Must fall by wondrous ráma slain .
Which stood , that chill september ,
Who dare to ask or take a bribe :
The peaceful shades they can not mar .
The student first the silence broke ,
Like phosphorescent waves washing summer seas :
To paint the language they have got ;
And the funeral leads to the wedding .
Is not the whole park made for them ,
From lips that spoil the ruby 's praise ,
And dare to take command .
Five lofty mountain peaks arise .
Above the city hung the moon ,
Nor lose thy simple faith in mysteries .
And words that idly comfort , bends the king .
Had set his fancy on a pig ;
The first scene discovers a wild wood .
Are potent to make all that hear them weep .
And shook his head to cast her thence .
And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
Nor private peace is seen to bleed ?
That turns earth 's smoothness rough ,
The years a double strength produce .
They stand for sale at golden price .
Faced every foe , and every danger sought ;
And find such beaming eyes awake
And here the buzz of eager nations ran ,
What hand and brain went ever paired ?
And the heralds brought this message :
Immersed remain this terror of the world .
I passed through touching scenes of humble life ,
While down the river we float on forever ,
The stain upon his silver down will stay .
And soon columbus ' happy signals came ,
An answer came from some fern-nook ,
Nurse says the moon can drive you mad ?
And his strong heart leaped within him ,
In marvellous flashes its fair self reveals .
Poise like the tides that flow ,
I pleaded for time to be given .
And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree ,
She neither sought nor wished relief .
Their forward discourse oft 's attended with pain .
And brought the dream to him .
But three faint bounds thereafter the dying monster made .
Not whelmed but scattered ? and the fame alone
But their wonder soon see cause to smother ;
From his eyes wept tears of sadness ,
But she covers them with darkness --
And though an alien land their dust is keeping ,
That love and poesy may it control ?
The true religion we maintain ,
A dominating passion must be heard .
Where bright-beaming summers exalt the perfume ;
And she , much moved that nothing quells
From some life ages since gone through .
Feel the tears that were dropped because
The gloom that haunts my mountain caverns flies ,
Will british fleets attempt to moor ?
To see if this arrangement suited that ,
Their spread sails dipped in a marmoreal way
Loud rang the armed tumult in the hall ;
Lo ! where it comes like an eternity ,
The queen of love did never move
While moss and clay and leaves combined
Here lies the road to rome . "
Then was called a council straight .
't is sweet to follow thee !
That he might free that holy heritage :
And time went by the other way .
Though far from nature 's limits thrown ,
Sang this snatch of a song ,
Take wings of love , that mounts the most :
A sense of shame -- yet mixed with satisfaction ,
To give new order to the double host ,
The blood of youth , that feels no chill
Where are the wailing voices that should meet
To reign the monarch , whom your hearts admire .
Their severed heads the ruthless victor bore ,
He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip ,
How dreams the heart has dearest held
To the open day gives blessedness .
In native dignity appear
That burden heavier then the earth to bear ,
His partial favour , and assists your wars ,
And her thoughts ran on as follow :
The indignant spirit fled , blaspheming loud ;
Lockt they lay thro ' all the silences .
They gave him cause thereafter full bitterly to weep .
It chanced that while the pious troops of france
The white stars have shaken it ,
A little breeze blew over the sea ,
Is wafted the fragrance they shed .
While she , to his periods keeping measure ,
Every morning and evening how quiet she stands
Made pleasure of what work she had to do :
Which make death lovely in a warrior 's eyes .
Delight his gaze , to whom , alas , belongs
Trample ! trample ! went the roan ,
Till i had brought good luck into the house .
Of rural younglings raise the shout ;
Was not with dora . she broke out in praise
As she with all her rules can never reach .
Till half their beauties fade ; the weary sight ,
But even wisdom is bound by gain ,
Far away the news was carried ,
And meet more sacred learning in his lines
When our names have gone out
As every wrinkle seemed to fill ;
The basis , on which love of glory builds .
Was drawn by strong desire unto the place ,
That o'er the earth its flickering splendor throws .
The loveliest flower that ever opened yet
Save to your soul , that answered well ,
Or led by hopes , or dictated from heaven .
' t is only daylight that makes sin ,
The congregation rose , and some went up
With both hands i will cover my naked shame .
No mortal shoulders suit the glorious load ,
The penalty which works the cure .
Touched by the morning glow , they shine
Since the open still makes me afraid ,
Because the red blood ran in him so quick .
Then stirred within him a tumultuous joy ;
Reflected shines the eternal light of truth ,
Of the glory that she makes , --
Of mighty shadows , whose dim forms despond
And left it cold and grey .
And mid their war find rest .
On khara ’s will , the monsters went .
And the sunshine gave it softness ,
And found no resolution -- only hung there ,
They still went on to sing and pray ,
To such an enemy who would not bow ?
That rings true-tempered holy womanhood ,
Still hovered nearer to his soul 's desire .
Such a coward you 'll not see ,
Thou makest broken music with thy bride ,
His wisdom sets all europe right ,
For see the rosy may draws nigh ,
Then met the eternal synod of the sky ,
And vainglory sought .
Shy youths , take warning by this my fate .
The sunlight falling o'er the waving grass ;
That wrought with fire of joy and light of tears
As my dazzled eyes could hardly stand .
We 'd gained our first objective hours before
While great wars above them hurled .
A countenance in which did meet
Was strengthened in the hate she nursed before .
Waved o'er the tomb where loved ambitions lay ,
To those whom they have followed long ago :
Restore thee safe , since my ulysses reigns .
The fiend again assayed to bear
That sometime they have put themselves in danger
And death with honor sought on either side .
With unwonted freshness begin to revive ,
I love the dawn to come --
Beside the bed where parting life was laid ,
And puffy backs that hide their red
The tidings flew swiftly to helge king ,
Where blossoming aśokas stood ,
In those fair eyes where all perfections keep .
Where blooms of gayest colour glowed .
He fell beneath the orders of a king
But youth would leave for newer soon .
As healthy sheep as you might see ;
For sacrifice the pious hero brought .
Kindled between them , with resentment fired
And now the embattled lines are laid
That leads to hesitation ?
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . "
For fools rush in where angels fear to tread .
Or sorrow o'er his bosom steal .
New life and sense and vigour gave .
Between nose and eyes a strange contest arose ,
And every minute gained is joy --
Such a patter the gravel did make .
Such beauty will make me beauty-blind ,
No fretted roofs with polished metals blazed ;
Where the great wall round china goes ,
But the voice cried : - " once remember
Where east and west are met , --
So to the countess straight he went :
That cast so exquisite a fragrance round ,
It never bath found but in _ thee . _
She " never found it colder . "
The wind it moaned , the wind it wailed ,
And then their sad life closes .
That harp which david touched who rears
And spreads its ruin on the mountain side .
Gently lay her form to sleep ;
I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds ,
Our cry for cradled peace , while men are still
Our doom was sealed , by a capricious judge
He spoke , and round him breathed heroic fires ;
The root of love lives on and on .
And hold the sunshine in its lap
Like a flower laid upon a flower it lies ,
My spirit turns for rest ;
His children shed while in deep sorrow here .
The black cloud-vapour that it breathes !
At times the summit of the high city flashed ;
Until a longing in thy soul arise
And with all moving arts entreat ,
I smile victorious , set far above
Of strength controlled sheer beauty to bestow .
Which is managed so blithely and brightly
Nor with another 's mourning was made glad .
He feels the wounds : what deals the blow ?
Like those to patient faith , shall rise forgiven ,
My breast with tender pity swelled :
Thus she gave the youth instructions :
Yet he clung to his purpose with courage most grim
And thus the dinner-platter was all cleared .
When luxury does the feast prepare ; }
But once with oil the flame is fed :
When nothing else is left in life .
Evil is intellect which , wrapped in gloom ,
Molehills and rabbit tracks that lead
More than your souls could ever frame to ask .
Knew her hour had come ; two daughters ,
And he whose might in battle pressed
But for all that 's gone and come ,
As nets by cupid flung ;
Of death dismiss , and , laying once thy hands
O land where reason stands secure on right ,
So wandering , he to argive cities came ,
But now unto thy looks are given
That held so perfect , with its gentle sway ,
For their salvation : -- so he passed his days
When word came to the carline wife
To make him guardian of his holy faith .
In grief and rage one breaks his bow ,
Eternal love , maintain thy life in me .
My soul makes question of the sun for thee ,
In dreadful fury bathe with blood the plain ;
Grew a new heart , which at this moment plays
Press on , in numbers passing tale ,
And melt those eager passions , that are
And hopes that blossomed , ripened to decay .
As we kissed , fresh beauty took ) --
Both give bliss ;
Of lands historic ; turning dusty pages ,
Forgetting daily self , my truest self i find .
Thy path with him to heaven shall lead . ”
But thy gentle love hath sent
And she began to sob , and tears fell fast
Truth like a star now flash , now fail .
A glorious voice came singing from the sun ,
Here as my story stood not on good ground ,
Fauns with youthful bacchus follow ;
Meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows ,
Fully to see what in the bolgia lay ,
The soil beneath , helping to hold it there ,
Who leave no art of cruelty untry 'd ;
He stood to hear the doom of fate .
Not merely that the earth may hide your guilt ,
" are you prepared to make every sacrifice ? "
With rosy lips caught up the strain .
And questioned , make me doubt of everything . --
To whom a careless coin you fling ;
Will take advice from one who 's wiser ,
We have left our youth behind :
The harvests sown in tears ,
For arrogance noted ; to his memory
No mother 's care their early steps directs ,
Oh , say , where goes your love ?
Our shame to feel , our pride to show ,
That o'er cordelia could not stay its tears .
Still weaving glass and silk into a dream ,
May there my latest hours consume ,
Lay more to tempt man 's soul to immortality
And many nights , that slowly seemd to move
Late at night his tune was spent .
Pent in me ached with passion-born distress --
Pass back and there beyond unfolds the sea .
“ in the wide woodlands that extend
The ms. has the lines which follow :
And the blood follows , where the weapon flies .
And make my tongue victorious as her eyes :
Oh , how kindly hath he kept his promise !
Which blew cold across the water ,
Loud blew the wind , and rain and sleet
And when he came bold robin before ,
All other beasts that saw , with like desire
Visibly flashing from the supreme throne
The curtain falls of india 's sudden night .
And when he finds his efforts all in vain ,
Arabia and the warlike hordes that dwell
Whose limbs were struck with pains of ague ,
So this shall follow thy delight ,
Then give to the world the best you have .
And shame said : i am sorrow comforted .
Whence nature views her loveliness displayed
But through the gored body took their flight ,
He will ne'er get his switch again ;
Those eyes shall make my only day ,
Like a huge organ , rise the burnished arms ;
Where cannon roared and bullets sung ,
The eye of heaven waxed dim ,
To other woods the trail leads on ,
Thy blood the priests make poison of ,
And swift to change , gentle and yielding always .
And loose their sails to catch the coming breeze .
When all thy praises are expressed ,
Had made his hand familiar with the bow
One longing , lingering , backward glance he throws ,
And to my ashes lend a tear .
The pyramids , and cruel creeds that taught
Or love , ecstatic , wake his seraph song ,
Which fronts the future and subdues the hour ;
Already flaming with the rage of war ,
Had run the race or sought the quest ,
More fearful vengeance hell might not conceive .
Tears fell , when thou went dying ,
And gratitude may thus move more
Much more than i relate between us pass 'd :
A new creation find :
While the _ magpie _ obtained universal applause ,
Answered in the words which follow :
I follow a famous father ,
I held myself as a sacred shrine
His waggish eyes in sport he wound .
What conqueror leads the gallic armies on ?
And bacon ( which makes full the meal ) ,
In which consumption and despair are pining ,
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar ,
Where the frayed flowers cure
And brightens life with sentiment and taste ;
Ere absence made her very being yearn .
When of the banks their leave they take ,
And lift the household out of poverty ;
It makes me blithe and bauld ,
Bells turn the sunset air to song ,
And , braving full their murderous blast ,
And torture them and break their toys .
Then added , turning to my guide his face ,
They tarried not to count the cost ,
And stony masks of scorn and hate belong .
That maiden 's eyes stuck over all his face :
Will its waves give rest to me ?
And the hope in the heart remains .
But i watch the moon as it goes by ,
Stilled the glad sounds that round him rose ,
Pining for love not found on earth ,
Pity that things so fair in death must lie ;
Where love and age went hand in hand ;
Whereas the finger 's shadow lay ,
Was gone to make way for a smouldering
His nose ranged swiftly , his heart beat fast ,
He ceased ; they gnawing stood their lips , aghast
Song that swoons and sinks with care ?
And many a budding rose to earth has thrown ;
It flickered out and left the darkest night .
Obeisance paid to every queen ,
Thy hector , wrapped in everlasting sleep ,
Shineth the gathered glory of the suns
The stranded moon lay quivering like a lustrous
The blow that levelled thee was in my heart ,
And , credence for his tale to gain ,
And sorrow set these chained words free :
The martial phosphorus is taught to flow ,
Of worshippers that pass ,
And bliss will rule the end .
By overthrowing me you threw me higher .
" i rose up with the cheerful morn ,
Upon his staff the gray-beard leant .
And praises clamorous shall make for all
The poplar fanned me with shadows ,
We 'll rise above the clouds to-night ,
Had touched him now and set the cords replying ;
To bring my spirit unto thee ,
Cast a shadow not of night ,
Weep , nor be with sorrow filled ?
Light , to shew their wayward goings ;
A wheel of shadow sped along the fields
They made a curious eden .
After that there came king herod ,
That held my life in the fresh , glad season
They bore the bright blue of the heavens ,
Fierce tyrants drop the scourges wherewith blindly
Like moonlight and sunlight combined .
The tawny lion , issuing with a roar
This hopeless love that knows not cure ,
Reaching to the clouds of heaven ,
While such faith shall stand !
Yet still the sword goes through her heart ,
When love and life shall pass away :
Gay summer sees the flowering
Why of the heritage no portion came
When breezes stir nothing but happiness . . .
With scorn replied , and made this bold defense :
Across the silver waves it goes
With her i 'd tie the nuptial knot ,
To freshen the soul 's virtues into flower !
My husband ’s love and bliss to gain ,
The somber funeral cortège found
Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth .
Of ownership and hide the things of sin --
And through the summer watched their blossoming ,
When she found she was tired ,
That of no wife took he none offering ;
Who would hold perpetual lease
The army of the fiends drew near
Has reared aloft his goodly scheme ,
With bands that strove to pierce and strike
Shall men of talents , fit to rule mankind ,
From the ooze arise , o fairest .
Making full circle of our banishment ,
Some startling image seemed to pass ;
The sun has sunk , and the whirling din
To which the strongest hearts have yielded .
The matter of the truth to grasp , believe ,
The ms. adds this couplet :
And dark and silent the water lies ;
" we saw from new , uprising states
Pardon , this troop i can not follow after
Above the tumult of the canyon lifted ,
The fighter who feels no dread ,
That evermore upon god 's errands go , --
Of him whose eyes to heaven are reared ;
Has found his upward way , i answer thee ,
The women -- and perhaps they felt their power ,
And all the nests that the bared branches show ,
The youth who goes seeking for pleasure ,
The flames shot from a painted fire ,
The women turned to teeming wives began
A river leading nowhere .
My spirit , mounting , follows thee ,
Dread-sounding , bounding on the silver bow .
To fold the flags of war , and lay
If jove would give the leafy bowers
The shadows deepened brown .
So his love to christ endure ?
And hope came in her breast ,
To charm his fancy , or his heart engage .
Of noisy crowds , and silence holds the air .
So soon , so soon , the changes came .
In sweetest bands their souls more closely drew .
That sight whose terrors shall assuage thy terror ,
Is the furrowed face of the year that goes .
Your smile replied : " since the glass was filled
And feel your kiss again ! _
That every word revealed a thought ,
Darkest night , invests the scene !
The fate of a nation was riding that night ;
And maiden will look for her lover ,
Filled and overfilled with passion .
A secret sympathy i ca n't express ,
For dubious meanings , learned polemics strove ,
The waters wild went o'er his child ,
Not poured forth , though sprung from sad lament ,
He plucked his body from her white embrace ,
For weary earth lay groaning ' neath her load .
The great tears sprang to their meeting eyes ,
These join the tyrian prince , and social aid
Than yonder oak might give the wind ;
I 'll strive my gratitude to show .
Christ conquered sin , and death , and night .
By the first beams of dawning light impress 'd ;
The devil of heredity which clutched him ,
While life waits wistfully
There came one morning a cry from our tavern :
And tossing horns arose and hoofs were churning ,
Called your spirit into being -
Ye made resound through nature 's wide domain .
Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life ,
My heart , alas ! must be divided .
Amid the balmiest flowers that earth can give
I 'm climbing now three hundred years ,
Like summer twilight falling brown ;
From beneath the tongues shot firebrands ,
Wonder and joy ran thrilling to his heart ;
Forms and hues and sounds that make
Wide roaming , heard the waters idly break
The slaughter to announce , she loud proclaim 'd
That jane 's good looks procured her many a gown
That o’er his cheek in torrents spread .
The treasure of hours gone -- scenes once beheld ,
And ask for them blessings that come from above .
Wait but that light which comes from love alone .
The powers of darkness bound . thou at the sight
A breast whence flows a loving song ,
Take heart ! the waster builds again ,
Now sleeping flocks in their soft fleeces lie ;
And softest ones that blow ,
Without distinction chases every one ;
So strait my world was grown ,
Though blandest smiles the happy party wore .
That strikes the earth with dread ,
Of a splendor that came and went ,
When the fierce pains took her in the forest ,
Laid out for dead , let thy last kindness be
And my pulses leaped and thrilled .
The only sign of our obedience left ,
Then did they shower on people and on kings
Why , i reckon , it 's confessed
Has many years , as human tongues would tell ,
The beet juice tears have washed her clean ;
She listen 'd with a flitting blush ,
But merely to show how much he knows .
For his agony to pass ;
To seek for wealth and seek for power .
The early primrose with shy footsteps run
On the sand the waves spread boldly ,
A talisman , that tells me of its truth .
To raise our hearths and altars
It sits there in the moonlight
My bird reposed his silver plume
And weave the bands of brotherhood
Sends the fever from the marshes ,
To enter into being thirsting ,
The pale contended with the purple rose ,
Fixed with the universe .
Drink life and fragrance as they flow .
Sleep draws near to his dreamless brother .
A mist lay sleepily ; and it was hard
To its fall leaning awful .
Of the blossoming mountains , and shifts the light cloud
Next , all-embracing air was spread around ,
At last , when some wan streaks began to show
And their visions drowned in tears .
Death and disaster through the billows bore .
From out the heart which does not flow ;
Nor shade beneath a straggling pine ;
The witty jest had flown , before a sigh
Have thy tears quenched the sun ?
Bring floods of grief to whitehall stairs --
The father 's voice that speaks itself divine !
The world can never give nor take from me ;
By whom his virtues feared and loved are :
And , feeling , give assent ; and their assent
As the lascivious streams caress the stones ,
Though thy scorn leave no love living ;
No ! the avenging gods , who punish crime .
Whom thou reportest in such misery thrown . '
Man 's heart still struggles , still aspires ;
Five score thousand franks are thereby made plain .
That makes the fact of things wherein men live :
Decrepit winter , from the south to bring
To make the deliverance ;
Through sullen swirling gloom we jolt and roar .
Hurrah ! the arrow that laid harold low ,
But bright cecilia raised the wonder higher :
The strength they borrow with the grace they lend .
Nor is in other human medicine found ,
And rooms where faded greatness still
To save his soul from hell .
From irma leese , from letters drawn -- beside
Still to the father 's heart the child restored ;
His realm might recognize an equal heir .
But love stands firm as a rock .
And left me comfortless . no load i bear
While pity went before ;
Her slumbering infant pressed .
“ hatred would such a conquest still attend .
A dreaming shadow that drifted by ;
Through which came flowing , flowing , flowing
Which by and by black night doth take away ,
When laws protect it ; but the hungry slave
Not to sleep art thou conducted ,
Delight shall spring from pain ;
Where freedom lies unarmed and unafraid .
" old age comes never -- oh , rejoice --
Here shall you trace in flowing operation ,
As your health or comes or goes ;
Who with us , the free , make feud .
And beauty shines in vain ' ? --
Can my patience such things weather ?
That made him victor in the fight ,
The magic all ran through .
As southern birds avoid a northern snare ,
With his grim eyes watching the course .
What peace he bringeth to my heart ,
Seeing his fields lie barren in the sun ,
So weak and miserable she lay ;
His echoed laugh replied ,
' if vanity will once be guided ,
Which made them apt for so much understanding ;
" till life is almost spent ! "
Was found to hold the hidden prize .
Life is good , and joy runs high
Shall not july bring fresh delight ,
The stranger 's knightly pennon bore ;
And guard the wisdom which herself inspires .
" see that the messenger takes some refreshment .
From the east dispatch a cloudlet ,
Like tantalus , as ancient classics teach ,
And seldom felt she any hunger-pain ;
The leafless timber roars ,
For when thy folding star arising shews
And with her magic singing kept she --
Their burial service said ?
And every seed that flora sows --
The trojan chiefs a troubled council held ;
That burgeoned all about us : gold and blue
And of creeping fears to cure thee ,
There shall his grave be made ,
Where purgatory its true beginning takes . "
To lift the weight of the unnumbered years
To make thy march triumphant , trailing not
Thy rest and ease secured be .
Commands them , forth to sacrifice are led .
The hidden love that guards another 's bliss .
And something purer , brighter , breathes
Our faith , which had not known the test ,
Into folly and sin has abandoned all pride .
Nor thrill 'd the poplar ; quiet stood
Nor give thee any love -- which were unjust .
My studies are not turn 'd unto the worse ;
" though no priest gave the mystical signet ,
My sight directed , and on either side
Upon the common clay from which they spring .
And oft as mirth and glee went laughing round ,
To chase injustice with revengeful arms :
Right great vengeance our emperour will get .
Of thought once tangled never cleared again .
All powers recognized god 's mightier will ;
“ shall move detraction from his valiant deeds .
In the close intimacy i feel for them
Through the trees the smoke shall rise ,
The tears of remembrance will gather and fall ,
Which their own leaves have made .
_ and the wind went sighing over the land ,
And now the storm-blast came , and he
Of january when there would be given
Fame dearly bought with many a brave man 's fall
Thy pattering footstep falls .
His own lost lightning raised to strike at him !
And bending trees gave pleasant shade .
And the spent ashes warmed thee best ;
There comes a pause , a shining hour ,
His eye must travel down , at full ,
At thy dead husband 's name the people show .
And temples drained of purple and full of death .
Even as my youth sings through my years .
Meadow where the heifers lie ,
Poor script , where still those tragic passions move --
And all his days he carried
And breathless effort to the post they strain ,
So flew the timbers . he , a single beam
Mark how he proudly treads the whitened deck !
The red flame , raging and wrathfully striding
Oh , wisdom never comes when it is gold ,
Arise , thou spirit spent by sterile tears ;
Expect the time to troy ’s destruction given .
Where evil hath never left traces ;
With childish pomp , and borrowed fame ,
And my heavy burdens lightened . "
For broken vow can such return be made
The path of sin begins to tread ,
' her charms were not to be withstood ,
Has struck with grief my lord and me .
To make it room ; the still night drifted deep
One morning , intending to take but a peep ,
That lit the waters answered them .
The second watch the wonted vigils kept :
And every flower that sad embroidery wears ;
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
There came one who understood not these things .
Where men breathe for the strength of highest life .
" and a good south wind sprung up behind ;
Did letters writ by fools produce
Where good with bad were matched , who of themselves
The wind is gathering in the west ;
With ivory orbs the planets set and rise ;
So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith :
Dull november brings the blast ;
Wondrous mysteries containing ;
As if to ask pardon that its words had made
If this were human breath i drew .
Takes the peace that twilight brings :
November passed ; and winter , crisp and chill ,
Far in the north our fallen days have seen
In the admiral is much great virtue found ;
And endless union endless increase brings ;
Gay with the gear and flags they bore .
Wherein more souls toward hell than heaven took flight ;
And i felt my heart go cold as death ,
Anon , and years dealt listlessly away ;
Till life 's short span is taken quite away ;
And dear to the heart her remembrance remains ,
When morning cleaves the eastern grey ,
She listen 'd with a flitting blush ,
Wisely and well has providence assigned
In mute and measured march a hundred thousand dead .
Where he scattered in fear the human deer ,
You took my dreams and made them true .
That feels the soft wind suddenly ,
And sense was lost in undistinguish 'd pleasure .
And all the virgins fell into their rankes ,
Make an end of thy deception .
O death , before resentment reconcil 'd .
And stand in front and lead the people on ?
Whence breaks the rose and all the flowers that greet
To the motive that it served . what stood
From souls that held no happiness ,
And she gave a cry of danger .
But now the story deepened . for she said ,
They shriek , they stir it for our sins ,
Their melancholy eyes they raised ;
Of lofty praises ; for there came to me
Where all of high and holy dies away .
He springs to slaughter , or himself is slain ;
In blushing sweetness lay ,
The flames troy willingly receives ,
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
The far woods lie . for in this place ,
Upon the blue billows the mermaid they place ,
The tent is struck , the vision stays ; --
And try to gain the summit at a bound ,
A whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side
And the dish ran away with the spoon .
Give utterance to his vaguely-formed desires ,
Is called for by the instinct of mankind ;
That knowledge which best serves us here on earth ,
Swiftly they rushed , like darkly lowering clouds
One cause alone have made this sore distress ,
Stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief .
Come share their leafy solitudes . grim death
That raked her splintering mast
That made as if it understood , and could
And the truth wore no disguise .
He takes a bound across the grass ,
This , sorrow without suffering made arise
And wings that sought the farthest skies .
Ere my grave , the sea , receives me .
Where charity is spent on every side ,
" whence is this arrogance within you couched ?
Ye have made a late discovery .
That was his laughter stilled , and sadly mute
And watch the crisping waves that pass ,
A creamier bubbling broke the bubbling brine .
And the dire ambush clytemnestra laid :
The new moon gave but little light
Of chariots that him convey ,
The flowing words that fill my song ,
Seventy-one , went william sellers .
The gallant fleet plunged on .
Then a silence came to the river ,
Her soul is like a shape that moves
The longings that had brought him there
The accursed plague , arrayed in surcoat , comes
For all this goodly earth contained for me ,
Before they were aware , the month had gone ,
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid roof ,
Virtues which none can match are thine ,
But their voices are lost in the dashing tide .
As never eye created saw its rising ,
Echoes that mingled and fainted and fell with the fluttering
Nor in the summer 's sweeter evenings go
And victims promised , and libations cast ,
Of wheels on the road that runs below ,
I 'll seek each silent path where we
And turn to pride , we see ,
The whole " establishment " went to smash !
Where will you take up your stations --
And joy with me . indulgent heaven hath shown
And rocked her tides , and made a magic world
But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking .
A deathful ambush for the foe to lay ,
Each that we lose takes part of us ;
For the south wind blew it around the world ,
How shall i reach the vortex of this pile --
And blacksmith 's ' prentice takes his lessons
What innocence crowned her brow !
Whereto no night arrives ;
I saw the towers of babylon , burning blue ,
Bidden to hold the christians ' right belief .
Touches so soft still conquer chastity .
From which every nerve derives suffering .
Darted his beams within , nor pelting shower
“ so fast the flood of rapture came ,
The prince the variegated present took .
By hearth and home , your real danger lies .
There stood the indian hamlet , there the lake
But noontide came and brought no father fond
Frames , daily , shining spheres of flawless stuff
While he stamped in his rage to destroy the nest
As much as your apron can hold !
There to get the lid in colors ;
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
And in your joyous errand reach the spot
And we would not cumber the way of truth
To lower sails and gather in the lines ;
And we give you deathless fame .
The limpid streams with gentler murmurs pass ,
The races rise ; the races pass ;
This christmas most cheerfully meet ;
Save for a royal gift to give her pleasure ;
His sermons never said or showed
Show where that soul went flashing as a star .
And darkness and doubt are now flying away :
The soldan hath the feld assailed :
Content to take the pittance he would give .
How have they reached on foot this place ?
It tells it to all who will heed ,
Nor any man 's that worketh cowardice !
That brought the fog and mist .
The missing link of love has left a void .
He steers himself away from what is haunted
Hermes to me his various gifts imparts .
This smile of death that fades not , shall engage
God ( so it runs ) made this world clean
Of every beauty grow in power ascending ,
From ill that follows after foolish play ,
Trying to make me see i 'm wrong ;
And beat by rains unseasonable and suns ,
The fatal word that swims and shines
Rejoiced as near he drew .
With lullaby now take thine ease ,
A little blood could give them had they seen
Scatter each cloud that would darken a star !
Into her heart too easy entrance won :
Perchance unto her day belongs
I follow a famous father ,
Aloft from cause to cause exults to rise ,
Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet
Whereby to mark asunder error and truth ?
That wails , my love goes quick in hell .
Down on dank sea-foundations broke the dull ,
To house the profit that arrives ;
The fault which lies direct from any sin
So from this skirmish neither part declined ,
Losing their purity , corrupted were
His likeness came up the house staukin ,
To breathe the air of immortality
Fast round with bonds that burnt and froze .
Concealed within it . he had armed his mind
Nor from his victory reaps other gain ,
The rain beats on our windows
Death 's dread armoury was stored
There still remained a year before her sweet
And the clock strikes the hour
The black bird made the sweetest sound ,
But her faith leaned another way .
She left her joyful harpings in the sky ,
And there its load of sorrow lays ,
While rapture trembling thro ' my eyes
I see the better years that hasten by
And , like the bull that leads the herd ,
The wicked báli ’s heart shall pierce .
Then infinite worlds follow in reason right .
With mutiny had fired the train ,
The flinty heart that canna feel --
The years shall come and pass , but we
Naught can shake my sure repose .
The lungs with the living gas grow light ,
Thy woods this autumn day , that ache and sag
And see so little gain from sixty years .
No tremor shook his thrice-nerved frame
Take heed lest his beams fall on you ,
And hold the tongue from hindering peace ;
The clouds swing out from beyond the hills
When so proudly she bore her brave crew ,
It made a rainbow in the night
Out of the dark that lies about my soul ,
Designed to spread a clearer light below
Across my path , and made my pulses swell
But here the tortured body finds relief ;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love ?
In one warm , glimmering mist that falls on me
Tears shall break from out me ,
From that on which his exiled age is thrown --
Yes , when the twilight 's falling softly
The world to offer for their sin .
Shall not bring success to pass :
Keeping sweet time to the air she sings .
Under the buffeting wind and lashing rain .
Robbing the spring of all its flowers ,
What new fate has overcome thee ?
And terror crept behind .
Her counsel gave with burning sighs .
Now , smooth as glass the shining waters lie ,
And did not dream , the minutes crept
Horatius sent a blow .
With the eye 's spirit running forth to meet
What heart could view thy smiling looks ,
( we heard it say ) she was dead ;
While yet in mid-air hangs the dew
But in thy breast the important truth conceal ,
A shame to break in on your blissful dreams .
" whether thy love loves thee . "
The fog-damp folded closer round the hill
It tramps in gleaming triumph round the world ;
Till , like one in slumber bound ,
And passed to a sweet repose .
And all who hear it turn to thee ,
That can not reach the south .
And those to pleasure all resigned .
Or you drank too much and fell asleep ;
Gone ? in a grander form they rise !
To banish strife ;
And the lofty are made humble ;
Life plucks all the blooming hours
Follow : and when god ’s will sees best ,
Said all was lost . then sullen troops
But since the lightning ceases as it comes ,
This also shows the nature of the same ,
And thousand myst ' ries does unfold ,
Now on the leafless yew it plays ,
I to the winds my cries of anguish threw ;
Heaven says to earth , shines the majestic moon ;
For freedom strove all she could do ,
That made the lion servant of his will .
He fought with numbers , and made numbers yield .
We see whate'er its pages tell ,
After the close which to that hymn is made ,
It will deceive , it will betray
And sword of temporal power to serve them .
Our eyes were drawn together , and the hue
His eyes flash 'd fire as he fled ,
Her thoughts in lovely dreamings seemed to glide .
That men commit beneath it . art and song
In all the bonds we ever bore ,
But show peculiar light by many a grin
In heaven , which follows dignity , might draw
Make truth a lie ?
Ye are pure to see and feel ;
The circles spread .
She listened with a face that wore
Making beethoven 's inmost passion speak ,
Fits a digestion by travel led astray .
There shot a pang of his old yearning pain .
With this true flesh , that follows after him .
" chilly spasms seized me then
Aghast to find that clasped hands would clench ;
And through the dance meandering glide ;
A soul that sees the future in the hour
To such entreaty answer thus was made :
Upon the bowl of oil ran round the rim .
For once a spirit " sighed for home , "
And round her couch the curtain drew .
And to his just commands led him to bow .
Still we find the cheerful-hearted ,
To you my soul 's affections move ,
When lay of hopeless love , or glory won ,
It forms a curious chapter , i admit .
How art thou tamed and broken !
As morning dew hangs trembling on the rose ,
The rose-trees show but a tuft of green
Of whatsoever breath the gods may blow ,
Whereof hope yet remains ! then might i lose
The hours we have spent together ?
It reaches to the fence ,
Who swept the loud chords of a lyre ;
" we , alas ! have come for vengeance ,
Weal and woe in song remain .
We know his blood can cleanse from sin ,
That drives into the roofs sublime
Achaeans . he denied her not , but passed
Would my life were crowned with sunlight ,
Saving love 's self , who stands superb to share
All forced by some strange necromancy
And lead us far into thy silent land ,
Still got new lies , or tidings very scant .
And the nails downward with them dragged the scab ,
In glowing freshness shows its vernal birth ;
And future years of bliss alone remain .
Misfortune if their shoestrings come
Hence on the fawning dog comes madness , hence
Love is not badly taken twice .
And never knew how fast time flew --
Every quivering leaflet speaks ,
Innocence gilds the dark shades of the tomb .
My soul shall make to every know behest ,
When the gentleman shed many tears .
The glow of his smile may always see ,
But held some tincturing of tears to thrill
Had planted it when faith was taught by fear ,
To prove , that luxury could never hold ;
That manuscript whereon our lives are traced ,
The years shall come and pass , but we
For which i let slip all delight ,
Let consecrating balm be shed ,
Peace let the dew send !
Gray pelican , poised where yon broad shallows shine ,
And stairways wound to the top of a hill
And homeward drove them , we two together ,
Then , as she took the ring he showed ,
Or when rough winter rages , on the soft
The flower within this vase confined ,
The thoughts that in his bosom woke :
Joy comes and goes , hope ebbs and flows
My own disgust is strengthened by your speech :
When not a star bestowed its light ,
That sings of paradise restored --
With bramble-roses ; and where autumn fills
Yet no new sufferings can prepare
Answered in the words that follow :
Returning light and life dispelled the gloom
Then shared the tyranny , then lent it aid ,
Thrills with the fulness you shall take ,
Without the gods , how short a period stands
And when a maiden finds a lover ,
So genius , to direct his course aright ,
Will your secrets come to view ;
That , like thy petals , trembles in possession ,
The ruthless fiends have grasped and rent .
The weight had grown beyond our strength to bear ,
Should i find no joy , nor respite .
Than was her own she in her hurry took .
Even he so sunk in wretchedness
To move the cook 's compassion ,
But who hallow 'd fountains thy threshold shall pass
In foreign lands , their memory be lost ;
From springs that falter and depart
And the worthy father , speaking with emphasis , added
Were but the mandate given .
Thereupon he fell to weeping ,
Has set my head to aching . i must go
Of the foul fell it wore .
Who mourns the wife he holds so dear .
And when the uproar ran along the grass
In warlike pomp , with banners flowing ,
Where shadows moved and ghostly spirits stood
And jokes were cracked in lively alternation :
Yet at the last his good days passed away ,
Nothing on earth is held so cheap .
O give my passions leave to run their race !
The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife ,
May your life in peace be led ,
They fled to bliss or woe !
Life lay entranced in sinless mirth ,
At length the fatal answer came ,
At a touch light as hers lost below .
Without such aid your triumphs spread
Although they went on doom in judgment clear .
Who joyful from their long confinement rose .
And his wishes served to guide him ;
And wove it with his fate ;
The congress at last has determined to quit us ;
The woman i loved and lost !
To purest hearts are given ,
The rolling battle 's bristling marge
Proceed to make your pious work as free ,
Beyond the town fast swallowing into gloom .
And the white waves have danced themselves asleep .
Our steps , that passed at will
Who fight to conquer love and rage ,
Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain 'd .
Therein shalt thou all night pursue thy way ,
Where -- where will they find comfort
And made the promise it should never break --
Sore troubled by her dream she rose
Salvation 's news to bear ,
Till we place it on a funeral bier .
That groaned like living souls to death nigh brought ,
The stricken city . colder blew the wind
That follows with such dread certainty
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;
Again impetuous drove the furious blast ,
Flames burst forth , wild sparks and ashes fly ;
But fix thy wavering dream
Fair as the morn trampling the dull night . then
Fast through the village spread the news , and stirred
Upon his feeble foes fell oft and thick ,
Which , when her love came her to prove ,
Oh , is it not to widen man
And sops of nourishment may get some few ,
On the wild waves poured her sorrow .
One must be made of money !
Right unto marsil their way they take .
All this angelic aspect can return
With tender thought , assumes a grace more sweet
Though he bury himself in his nethermost hell ,
And his pose assume a sad and solemn style ;
Ambition first sprung from your bless 'd abodes ,
Which would not let the common air come near ,
Those hosts of drifting universes , led
Shall hope 's sweet vision yield her spirit rest !
And providence have wrought thus quaintly . here
The dusky clouds from labour ’d earth arise ,
And rendered firmer by the weight he bore ;
The vales redoubled to the hills , and they
Are rare . with this distinction take my words ;
Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch :
His sermon never said or showed
I feel this place was made for her ;
Nature brings her natural fetters , man is
The feathery clouds moved slowly through the sky ,
The only art her guilt to cover ,
His goodly spirit should move forth , returning
The burden that on him is laid --
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking ;
Wherethrough from distant rooms sweet music came ,
Round the cape of a sudden came the sea ,
But outside the clean air was filled with light ,
Of the retribution given ,
With heavenly drums was made to sound .
And reaching god with its imperious call ,
In haste there came a pagan valdabrun ,
For somebody hid hatred and hope and desire and fear
A new and living way they tread ,
The songs that i made for thee .
Watching the ships go by ,
A train of years in vice and folly spent .
Of flowers set in comeliness ;
And her torn fan gives real signs of woe .
By the long woes of nations set at war ,
It always brings us enemies or love !
And the wind that waits and poises
And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers
When the wild clouds fly low ,
For the sorrow your deed shall bring ,
Then a foal rose from the furnace ,
The air goes reeling , typsy with perfume ,
The masts and spars went by the board --
Our lips may _ feel _ the goblet 's edge
How oft in loneliness the heart will turn ,
In folly ; run , and make themselves away ;
Hanging and floating over it , it stands supreme --
Weeping ; and so find kindness to her healing .
Another 's sorrow may thy ears enjoy ,
Will stop a gap i somewhat dread ,
She will never make thee happy
Take your stripes and stand for orders
To wrap and blind thee with the snows
That won my heart in my greener years .
Which now so dull and darkling steals ,
The song he rumbled lowered . round and round
It all comes of the foolish fright
And left no greater mark than drops which rain
Now hangs as mute on tara 's walls
Of freedom -- where at last it dwells ,
The priesthood can belong !
The sanguine scene that told his tragic fate ?
But times will change and friends must part
In chrysoprase apartments hung ,
Till dawn another day do bring .
A candle to hold to my sister fair ?
They see how spirit comes to light ,
Which project suited best with heaven 's decree ,
And midway its leap his heart stood still
Of hopeless dreams that come to them unbidden .
From the heft o ' misfortune she bore .
And when the roaring hillside broke ,
The comfort he gave me there .
Murdering the livid hours that grope for peace .
This mantle , to cover the phantoms of fright .
Thy perfect choice for me , i rest ;
The shadows curtain dusk , thy lonely rest .
To pallas thus her winged words address 'd :
To show how sweet it is to be !
They cut the wave with the living oar ,
There is an autumn yet to wane ,
And dead leaves wrap the fruits that summer planted :
As texts prescribe , in scripture found ,
Flashed out the rapture of his proud surprise .
Alas ! her fatal beauty rose once more ,
Against god 's pleasure , than that fruit which makes
And , however fast they might wind the winch ,
A shepherd leading forth his sheep ,
And the storm has ceased to blow .
Can never yield a hope of our relief :
And i pulled my love inside ;
How the boat drew homeward filled with flowers !
Her manners quite the wrong way rub me :
Let nothing make thee sad or fretful ,
Dear human minutes , marred by human pains --
And made the very billows pay them toll .
Through me there runs a shuddering --
The small success that brings defeat ;
Something , whose truth convinced at sight we find ,
Is drawn the sweetness of her kiss ,
And round them many a valiant soldier lay .
The way great ladies go .
And throw the light over the moor . "
Tam did na mind the storm a whistle .
Whose tinkling armlets made a sound ,
Stare hard at the sun they can not follow .
To make my heart sae wae .
Dreading zeus ' menace gave they heed to her ,
Now comes the christmas-tide :
I see terrific woes impend ,
The phantom armies marching go !
It could not make thee bald a single hair .
The eternal saki from that bowl has poured
Where only strangers ' feet pass o'er
With thee my heart shall find .
And something in its odor speaks
With blossoms that climb fantastic in colour , --
The counter our lovers staked was lost
In form unlovely ) was set free ,
Confess their heaps show lesser than thy dust .
And strikes all growing things with death .
And rattled me fast to a silver strand ,
And showed not fortune thus how fame and sway ,
" your father gave me cordial greeting ;
Where the star of lee led on .
It comes that the primordials can not be
Her spirit wrestled for the heavenly dew ;
Where secrecy remains in bliss ,
I 've found a consolation very sweet ,
The turf crawled and the fungus crept ,
Do not ask the ways of others ,
The wind , the tempest roaring high ,
And feeling , that belong
On whom he pinned his faith !
The lowliest duties on herself did lay .
Here stood i to keep the goal :
The ghastly dun shall worry his sleep ,
But in the onset come : so shall i taste
O love , o lava breath that burns ,
Thy teacher gives thee good advice .
And all the welkin where the stars endure .
The wisdom making passage through our slough .
And new-born pleasure brings to happier men ;
As in my heart sweet thoughts arise
Could turn to some account his thought ,
With malice filled , about my love ,
To lay out fortune 's gifts ; and niccolo
Who wish to take the tone of their society :
And a word that shall echo forevermore !
That ranks him among demons all but first :
Calls me to join my kindred of the dead :
So maggie runs , the witches follow ,
Then are thy feet set on the certain course .
Then gathering up my gains at last ,
With nature 's god to hold commune !
Enjoys the air it breathes .
But death is the worst that comes of thee ;
For that wherewith the house was made .
Into the web of speech their purpose wrought .
" my heart has flown to join thee , "
Grim horror seizes thee !
And wash the body whence the life has died ,
On the crops the white-frost settled ,
Dull and low his fire was burning ,
That all with mutual impulse tend to god .
Even to that coast where freedom sent to quell ,
But flora has stolen the rainbow and sky ,
They sought to brace from the awful shock :
And branching off there runs a track ,
Shout ! let it reach the startled huns !
The moon takes up the wondrous tale ,
He meets the dark and glorious eyes
Then the dark ripples spread to waving hair ,
Disloyal to god , did selfish ends pursue .
Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
The herald placed demodocus again .
That their airy flight may let
The good resolutions we made last december !
And little whimpers ran in quire .
Where other powers farre different i see ,
Songs that fill
Moths beat about me , and bats flew low .
Over three faces a sad smile flew ,
Divided , like the souls they carry .
That it visits its earthly home no more ,
It seemed that death had touched and chilled
Should join our hands to pray to thee ?
All tuneful winds do down it pass ;
And mine is the gentle song that bears
In vain they pushed inquiry to the birth
And following where the music went ,
For hope and love command my heart to stay .
For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch .
The evening also waned -- and coffee came .
The committee said that verify
Not even death ! life could bestow no bliss
And when the sun had put away
Sweetly , as it used to rise
Wild winds went straying ,
The angler plies his line and rod ,
That works the soul 's anxiety ,
Sublime as juvenal , he pours his lays ,
Seeking the fleece and finding misery .
Anothers worth to make his own seem brave ;
The flavour might be beaten . "
After the close which to that hymn is made ,
A look of pity hither cast --
Will turn the thing called love , aside to hate
He knows , who gave that love sublime ;
Men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire .
Of heavenly truth lay , like a broken beam
We caught the solemn voice of single air ,
That darkened nature lived did still proclaim .
Still puts forth its foliage gay .
It would have made the boldest shudder ;
Which art , not nature , makes so rare ,
To drive the dragon slavery from the land .
From the maiden 's spirit never passed ;
Can pierce that guardian flame .
Through the triumph of penance his soul arose
Of morning with the light they shed .
Is living in the life they lead .
And found herself in sore perplexity .
To press campaigning that would hoist the star
For he was restive to the guiding rein .
Though linked to insufficient means for god .
At this the hero cast a gloomy look ,
The patriot 's voice , to teach and rouse ,
Would make the temple theirs again .
It oft would challenge me the race ;
Laughing came one
Love looked back as he took his flight ,
Soon found his astonishment merged in delight ;
In arms the huts and hamlets rise ;
Therefore let pass , as they are transitory ,
To the wake each night went he :
Thy woes , dear son , my thoughts engage .
Till she in him should healthier life produce .
That makes the soft breeze redolent ;
He should feel a proud spirit within him proclaim ,
You hear the sweet bells ring in rhyme ,
And such she fitted to old melodies ,
They set beneath her night of hair .
They fell like dew upon the flowers :
Us with his sword thus cruelly to trim :
In what commandment 's large contents they dwell .
Of toil the crowded city moves to lay
Least he after marriage find times go hard ,
Must shake , and heavy will the vengeance fall !
Or laid aside forlorn :
Which adds new glory to the shining sphere !
And makes him comprehend the beauty rare
Stern vulcan homeward treads the starry way :
Could not see your heart of passion ,
And spirit coming to create new worlds .
God in externals could not place content .
Paradise is clouded by the measure of your pain ;
A month of idleness had gone .
Now cloth with plump pendants shine ,
Thou hast false judgment against me wrought .
Then take up once more their mournful line ;
The eyes that held have freed their narrow mirth ;
For if my place give me great pleasure ,
Full-armed the fear was born and grew ,
It made a wreck of father when
The flower that once has blown for ever dies .
Moved with this little tale of fate ,
But guide my steps to endless life and bliss .
To take the mount by easier ascent . "
Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union .
With burning thoughts making a summer air .
Far beyond the sunrise and the sunset rises
They felt the ocean o'er :
Did his desires still turn . but she a while
Others his breath , with poison loaded , kills .
't is not the frost that freezes fell ,
Our william 's trials led him oft to think
Their lots inscribed , and forth the latter flew .
Of wine , dissolving oils and frankincense ,
That answer got to question put .
When infidelity stands lowering here ,
Whose bribed menials fired their dwelling ?
So care and anguish darkened him .
A cloud wear the smile of the sun ?
No help his life could save ;
To give their fevered mother air of the lungs .
Not distant , on the happy coast she stood .
A joy is folded in my heart ; and when
The glittering snakes that made them gay .
The sorrow of her life , she threw
And sad , uneasy thoughts arise .
With eyes that flash and quiver ;
That rend thy nobler self apart .
So that i do approve what forth emerged ;
From whence thy essence came
With growing sway the growing life of man .
With many little sobs that took
Comfort your sorrows ; for they do not flow
Eluded me . and then at once it came .
Which for man 's guidance never come to light ,
That faith in love which love 's self gives ,
And when the sun has left the skies
That santa considered just right for small boys ;
To blast their hopes and hurl them down
Of kind encouragement them thus address 'd .
She drank what sorted with her sex ; nor more
Your thousand years have passed . "
To save her race , who cast upon the die
All the air is drenched with tears .
And takes half animate the air ,
Holds disputation with each thing she views ,
He never made use of his horrid old sting ,
Her love appeared , appealed for mine
That earth has something yet to show , --
With their own eyes the ambush hidden there .
The angel , when he felt the sleeper stir
My third enjoys an age , they say ,
Whatever the uncomely tale declare .
His eager eye can trace ;
To each a daily task is given ,
Yet still one comfort in his soul may rise ;
As far as they could get ,
That comes to all ; but torture without end
See the whole vision be made manifest .
And give me kisses three .
I am the soul that calls you to rejoice .
Deep malice to conceal , couched with revenge :
Now comes the wind , and lifts
Meanwhile the world , ambition , owns thy sway ;
On the tumbling sea with his moaning voice ,
Swiftly we went through the sunny air ,
Virtue is not won by fears . "
And he spoke the words which follow :
How shall i reduce its glowing ,
I had , i found , done very wrong .
A box of matches chanced to stand ;
First in the mould i laid my love ,
The charm thy presence brought ;
That stood beside the sea . "
Doth full perfection and new life infuse .
When showers fell on thy many coloured shade
Weary of life would here embark ,
While me alone the tempest overwhelmed and hurried out .
Nor what the insult offered to the king ,
Let those who pant for wealth or fame
Thy best attire and gems collect ,
The close-jammed clouds then struggle to discharge
The care is next our other chiefs to raise :
So that vile monster lay upon the border ,
To whiten , bending from a balmy gale .
Thus it was we made our escape !
Which makes it boil along the throbbing veins . --
All carduel follows with its roaring wave .
" and change your grief to songs of joy ;
And rain in may to fill the grasses ,
To wrath so moved were the knights and lords .
Had swell 'd his heart , and made it rise
When yearning heart is torn from yearning heart .
Thy wings do breathe of immortality ,
My misery knows no allay ,
Were spread the shades of death ; his mangled corpse
Thus passed the night in calm repose ,
He carried down of this miraculous joy ,
The scourge is red , the spur drops blood ,
With golden sunbeams flashing through .
Be careful to stop in your noisy career ,
Life may give for love to death .
Has found his upward way , i answer thee ,
Heaven gave to man this wide extended round ,
They only follow to deride ;
And tears , we gave him gratitude :
But would have given his life for thine .
Ægisthus found living at his return
" and thus in sadness two long summers passed .
For him , who in a hundred battles stood
The murmuring waters ran and broke ;
The anxious light inside will wave
So turning to that boy divine ,
And which alone can fill it with true life .
And all his minions led to die
Unmerited the grace in mercy given :
Draw any of your pity after me ,
White violets find whiter rest :
So that more living its plantations stand .
Take my love this april song ,
And , to the windward as they cast ,
The sturdy butcher seized upon the hint --
Then rose on high a fearful yell
Some measures comely tread ,
These still repair what wisdom would destroy .
Sad were their souls . the sea threatened death ;
Then women and wine take a second place
Whose echoes still went on and on ,
That came so near to being his ?
With blushes ever burning ;
Keep tryst with love before death comes to tryst ;
The thing i strongly seized has turned to darkness ,
And a good south wind sprung up behind .
Tho ' sad ones count the hours so long ,
O time ! that counts no years ,
Come , bring once more that ecstasy of bliss ,
Should fill the sweetest strain .
But knowledge of his love brought more delight .
A memory time never could efface --
Mild , like all strength , sits crowned liberty ,
To gain the boon his soul has sought ,
From each new sea they furrowed into pearl
The imprecation , born of righteous wrath ,
I hear your precepts tried ;
For as love 's wild prayer dissolved in air ,
Which for himself he had not made .
The pangs that then atrides ' might subdued .
Long crumpled , till creased consciousness lay smooth .
The bitter life they drew from her cold breast
Stoopes low as what it tramples on :
To check such monarchs as with brutal might
' the true refining touch may take ,
Death comes not , and kaikeyí still
Then let not winter 's ragged hand deface ,
Bend his heart unto christ 's belief ,
The sound of many torrents came ,
Safe from change that time to matter gives ,
Nor turn them up to pray .
In the low vale of life , that early felt
Which gave a lustre passing light .
Give us a heart with love so fraught
Deep in the shade his harp he cast ;
With royal fare to make the tables groan ,
The stars swim out , --
All these their mirth and pleasure made
Mark how he proudly treads the whitened deck !
From the summer hotness hid --
In such devotion passed seven days . at length
Whose blood the conquering foe conspired to spill
When godless persecution reigned ;
The straining sails of unimpeded ships !
When prussia hurried to the field
And madly bathed it in celestial gore . "
And doth regain its dwelling , and , once more
There , daily were my footsteps turned ,
But troubles came thicker upon us ,
Quiet , nor showing their accustomed pride ,
A panic seized the brownies all ,
Then , swooning , called on love to save .
Night goes hurrying over
At length an author 's one great work appeared ,
Can even spare a _ methodist _ .
A crystal spring poured out a silver flood ;
But winter finds it when she leaves
The blind goes out , and i wander
Sweet iris hath a gentler thought . she brings ,
To all that breathe the air of heaven ,
He wish 'd his friend would make it known ,
Making the darkness deeper where hides the nightingale .
Of outside anguish while it keeps at home ?
The bounties that the feast could give ;
' twill wander through the realms of bliss , --
For loss of blood soon makes him faint .
Seems held and folded in by golden noons ,
The clouds are withdrawn
Through tattered foliage the hail tears crashing ,
No comfort in his woe could find ,
Fortune demands the final stroke alone .
So still the reckoning rises ; and appears
Seem like a hand stretched toward the sky
That waked conviction in his doubting heart :
He touched her hand . it leapt quickly away .
With what authority it gives its charge ,
Ogier was grown content to live and die
Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along --
And there we saw the sweet zephyrs rise ,
My senses heave in this convulsion !
And i can sort and name these passing footsteps .
That i 'm a man is fully shown
Which sinks hot with this chain of clay ;
If death threw down his gage , love ,
Ah wise , my heart knows well how wise .
The water dwells a multitude , whose sighs
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
Summer passed o'er her : rains of autumn came
Idleness , like a flea will gnaw
To aching grief , so void and lone
In one to whom your friendship once was given .
Thou wouldst find peace and rest :
That shut for everlasting , came a clang ,
But she went on , more excitedly : --
Still holding speech , of which i nothing say ,
By toil and famine wore to skin and bone ,
And , guided by the holy dove ,
All the beauty comes from ukko . "
As one in slumber held . not long that mood
Fair as a sunset that on roses lingers ,
For that old faded midnight
The balmy breath collecting , he embraced :
That bore another rose ;
And hence to his brain was a madness brought .
Look , thou substantial spirit of content !
She thunders out the grandeur of her wars ;
U for the umbrella that keeps off the rain ;
That lifts above the soil each buried thing ;
And i sha n't stand waiting for love or scorn
And now it sinks into my garment 's hem .
But sad occasion calls : who now forbears
On the south-going breezes shall deepen and grow
And mutual dreams the bygone bliss retrieve .
Thunder-clouds loom heavily !
By bold ambition led . "
Had reached the alarming age of three ,
And then the lily lost .
And reach 'd the ship and caught the rope ,
Doth heresy uplift its horrid head ;
There let the world 's rude , hasty ways
Ah , folly ! long hath fled the hour
Now harks the calling squalls .
The breath divine , lingering on mortal lips ,
He plunged , and the gulf closed .
Some by old words to fame have made pretence ,
In casting out the falsehood for the true ;
You should find favour , too , at rome .
Above the friends about him thrown .
Here 's a game to test your mettle ,
It once held two love-thralls ,
" these follow me , " the season says :
And high the wild commotion rose
But if horror can not slake
My spirit knew for its own .
Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light ,
And fair summer lies a-dying ,
And thus they bore her swooning to her tower .
Died away , which heaven gave .
Fast gathering darkness , and fast waning light , --
Till the sun and moon changed places ,
More than six yards beyond his horse he bore .
For sure he met with strange adventures .
How the red roses flush up in her cheeks ,
That leads from earth to heaven .
No hopes of power my heart can touch ,
That makes our lives worth living .
“ plainly i see : not ignorance me misleads
All who turn to it . had this text divine
Tell him the truth , and sees that it accords
Almost three years were ended ; when there came
With much to read and little to divert ,
An ' bore fraternal greetin 's
The streamlet repeated its one silver word ,
All care what life or death might say ,
His books and his blocks made him tired ,
The floods lift up , lift up their voice ,
She traced the pastures up and down
The harvest which sprang in my heart
The sunset clouds have built her funeral pyre ,
As music unto the hand that smote the strings ;
Two hundred years are mist that rolls away ;
In all things grew his wisdom and his wealth ,
An ' that fell cur ca 'd common sense ,
Was one to make the bravest hesitate .
Round and round the seasons go .
Where his blessed footsteps lay .
Because eternal spring there crowns the fields ,
He rushed upon the heap , and fighting fell .
" so that when thou standest the church within
Let my hair then stand an end :
Such change is wrought by love alone !
A hermit , nursed on woodland fare , —
Just as fate or fancy carries ;
To sammy 's door their way direct they took ,
The moonshine sinks down as in slumber ,
A jury sat , and found the verdict plain --
Hearts that beat with love so true ,
What gentle words and thoughts may fall
He stood his match , i rather ought to say
What she foresensed -- destruction seething toward us .
Here goes to put old bowneck through ! "
God 's own hand shall guide thee there .
Whose brandished weapons made a golden glare ,
Whither all these charities go ;
The joyous choir that drown her murmur : -- so
Give to god the praise !
A message , filled with dread ,
If scurrility ever an opponent can hit .
Her laughter hid , and shame was born .
And gaze adown that molten gulf reveal 'd ,
For i the written book did never see ,
The evening breeze across the lilies blowing
New pleasures succeeded ; the spell was of power
Whose throbs it came , like gleams of hell
Man fears the lion 's kingly tread ;
To find , that conquest was your sovereign view ;
His soul hung in an atmosphere of grace ,
The thunder-gust was driven .
And the silent desert called again :
Sorrow follows the footsteps of crime ,
Fainter grew the voice , still fainter ,
Of thy unmeasured pasture , blend in praise
We live a little ere the charm is spent ;
To follow a fair virgin of his blood .
The holy hermit raised his eyes ,
Of learning from his lips . amazement filled
After the shadows pass o'er .
And tenderness sits looking towards the lands of death ;
Some lyric , breaking like the sea ,
An ’ put a fineish dash on .
Now , their very memory comes
Be mine the tree that feeds the fire !
Of added trojan wealth to buy the peace .
A sunflower for device he took --
The monarch of the giants lay ,
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . "
And fixed upon the following new year 's day
The baleful strife from court dissension rose .
A whisper soft arose when this was said ,
' those beauties which can never fade . '
The midnight altars he began to spread .
It all comes back as the end draws near ;
To light the human spirit , which emerges
I show thee friendship delicate , as dear ,
" whither shall we take this wonder ,
Till all the grass was gone , o !
Its hails of mystery ne'er explore .
Though it have brought destruction on the world .
That the long stain of time might fade and merge
And have i but a web of sorrow wrought ?
To him no joy this world of nature brings ,
Hands and hearts the labour strengthened ;
And to-night no moon we see ! "
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar ,
The precious end , which makes our wisdom wise .
Where sorrows never come .
From my trembling hands the pen fell ,
What reins were tightened in despair ,
And first the footsteps of a god he found .
She faded midst italian flowers ,
Let my will impel thee seaward . "
Long patience hath such mild composure given ,
Should fitly house the glory of my name .
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
Best of it all i find in your eyes .
But bore good character .
Its sayings fall like ancient memories ;
Where great trailing clouds stride across the world ,
Of linked sweetness long drawn out
While eyes , that mocked at tears before ,
That stood on a dark strait of barren land .
The funeral rites shall undertake ,
The book , the box on mantle laid ,
Or turning marriage into arithmetic .
Rage prompted them at length , and found them arms
And wrapped in all her summer harmonies
Pray god , they come to blows ! "
And drawing foul ensample from fair names ,
Breaking the silence of the seas
Take your joy with the heart of a boy
The son 's obedience knew no no ,
As each brief line wherein her joy was told .
Cleaving the incense-clouds that rise ,
And made his taxed up subjects pay ;
The falling rain that bears the greenery ,
O race of humankind , take shame !
A stranger whose pale handsome countenance drew
All roads that lead to god are good .
And death annuls whatever state i held ?
They tell of humours on the skin ,
By cultivation now would they diminish .
Of what his childhood knew .
A hazy moment , by a breath dispersed ;
Her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fixed
I shall feel young again as in my youth ,
I saw it -- pink and white -- revealed
The angels , bending their calm brows ,
But his shield was picked up in the heather ,
And o’er it have his legions passed .
" for his songs i caught the adder ,
The white will tell you how i languish ,
I feel they are , and in my heart anew
The melancholy lady lay .
Spoke the very words which follow :
The sun strikes down with a blinding glare ,
Upon his sullen coils may beat ,
Where the sunlight flashed -- where the shadows lay
That leaps with feathered feet before the hunter . "
Which frees from slavery needs no valiant mind
Are opened to admit the " lullaby "
Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease :
Their voices make me feel so solitary . '
Her mortal flesh bears him who conquers death .
And looked upon their hatred 's retribution ,
The ages come and go ,
But it brings the fools to raving . "
Wherefore the pleasures pass them by :
That follow 'd frederic to the silent tomb .
Sweet landscapes forming , which can never pall
Unlike the pure vision they 're ranging in now !
One pathway of sorrow by all has been trod ,
The restless swallows building in the eaves ,
Of tuning and of placing comes from mind ,
Hector , conducted thither by the gods .
And thus with calming words addressed :
The music ceased ; the noonday dream ,
May blessings on thy life attend :
Your country 's freedman , loosed from toil ,
Which stormed across the spirit 's anguished face : --
And bid your steed go faster ;
Was giving wealth with a lavish hand ;
Chase them away-they bring but pain ,
It never could yield an unpleasant reflection ,
Gave sentence . in the midst two talents lay
What magic to the magnet draws the steel ?
And in its ashes baldur 's sanctuary lies .
Sprung up holy hewson 's power ,
That frosen horror ran through everie part .
Unless alarm came from the camp of love :
All unprepared , the charm i spin :
And sappho goes as lightly as a leaf
And in apollo 's temple hang on high ;
With rising gales that sped their happy flight .
Of lofty praises ; for there came to me
Casts of midges bring ,
Ashes gray and failing cinders
He filled with piercing ether and endued
With arms enfolded , and with eye all fixed ,
And love is taught hypocrisy from youth .
And feels the soft anxiety she gave .
What confusion would cover the innocent jesus
Here lie the arrows of the foe .
How comes it then that from such high estate
And saw your road and where it led ,
And make me feel it was my sin ,
The old witchcraft still is spread . "
Who were boasting the cash sacrifices they 'd made ;
Choke house and temple . nor hath vengeance found
Four summers coined their golden light in leaves ,
His fingers swept the keys that flashed like swords ,
At feet of writhing trees . the violets raise
Of anger shall remain , but peace assured
They wage with death a war for life ,
In this the task and mighty labor lies .
In raptures , there she goes !
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move ;
Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes !
And from these this name they found .
O joy that seekest me through pain ,
Wide eyes , where smiles like baby rainbows grew ;
The original spelling and capitalization have been retained ;
In fields which bore three yearly harvests , met
And hope fell sick as the witch drew nigh .
The edition contained about 100 copies .
By one man 's firm obedience fully tried
Making all the vales rejoice ?
Thy thirst , which from the triple question rose .
Where bark-coats lie with many a wreath ,
The word , for all with trembling held in awe
May it enable me to express clearly my conceptions .
And all was covered with the curling sea .
Which his heart venome must asswage .
The fatal blow , pirus , advancing , urged
Just as the day began to wane and darken ,
This very day my new resolve shall see . --
Happier than they who still perceived their woes ;
Of borrow ( unless foresight cheat me here )
A flick , and the gates are passed .
In acid juice , in vain attempts to rise .
To hue and radiance god hath given !
When day is done , go willingly to sleep :
Than all that went before --
Is scattered , of the lily and the rose .
Through his thick hair the sword goes glancing round ,
Which held the lifeless form of one held dear ,
His eyes seek hers ; unto her face still higher
Finds grace to heal or help thy woe :
Gan to be sprinkled with the lights of eve .
Softly swam the boat that bore our love .
In doing what we most in suffering feel ?
Which showed the advertising , circulation .
Take my advice : first to the gods commit
My friendly care her way shall track
Mine be the sword that freed at marathon ,
I am the heartbreak over fallen things ,
The hand of sorrow touched me ,
These ancestral lays unravel ?
The serious mind is born of sorrow ;
To think such beauty means a trap .
And poverty stood smiling in my sight .
The words the flower had said to me ,
The mountain road goes up and down ,
See where the fire-logs glow and spark ,
And wither as the tempests blew ,
What of true poesy to them belongs .
About my lone life settles , wild and wide .
Drop by drop the horror falls .
And the solemn bells hung nigh it
There sees the summer pass and winter come ,
Night gave this priceless hour of love ,
Must yield anon unto the melting mood .
Like those the romans raised of old ,
Sees life sitting hopeful within .
The red leaves flutter idly down ,
We have found us already shunned , disdained ,
The bluebells tremulous stood
After her father had from life departed ,
Fast into night the life of freedom dies ;
His pity gave ere charity began .
Had made my parent 's temper fiery ,
“ becomes the source whence angry hornets rise .
Fate is made guilty , and he innocent .
Want and woe are found .
And dawn had broke ere he was found .
A little curl was tossed .
Bound by the season , by the horizon bound .
Whereon life 's race to run .
Such a beginning he in answer made me .
You found she needed a little preparing ?
Alone can save you , from eternal stings .
The bright-eyed flowers that form our bed ,
Through him the gale of life blew high ;
Strong hate may vile kaikeyí lead
And make just laws below the sun ,
" let not my language now be wrongly viewed ;
But when from one 's own cheeks comes bursting forth
The winning tears steal down his hoary cheeks .
Pleasant they are to feel !
Whom sorrow may not reach or evil blight .
They steer for those far highlands
The warmer breezes , traveling out ,
The driving winds heap up the snow ,
The world and all masons his merits confessed ;
Like to a stone a curious child might cast
And feel the primal sex of heaven and poetry :
While recollection 's pow ' r is given ,
It strengthened a fate beset by fears
And visit twice black tartarus , mark the way
Whence sometime sweet anthems and incense arose .
In regions where his maker shed his blood ,
What dreams of splendour blinded us and fled !
Ulysses seated , greater reverence drew .
From friendship 's tree untimely shed !
And the waves might beat in fury ,
And filial care my life renewed .
And for past ills to furnish glad amends
Which lowly shall be counted . noble work
That for achilles ' image stood his spear ,
And light is mingled with the gloom ,
Her course anew towards the abbey steer .
And from thence he made his answer ,
And now forth went achilles by the side
Where intertwining branches made
That saved us from the wintry tempest drear ,
Have set discovery at defiance :
The hands of holy promise , finds a throng
In holy discipline was filled .
Came forth to take a survey of her realm ,
And the curse quickened from the cox , our bows
So i took to hunting bears !
Yet nought for him remains but ceaseless woe ,
That lay in the house that jack built .
Passes the night , the clear day opens now .
In poverty or pride love comes and goes ,
Worth being poor to hold in fee .
And he spake the words that follow :
And carcants cast a luring light
She felt the misery that lacketh tears .
And he spoke the words which follow :
And in silence , bathed in tears ,
Will plant a stigma on the female race .
Each attitude that art would trace .
There was no sound but long tears following
O'er absence which makes others weep :
The marshes that about his city go :
They took them to their shields full fast ,
Raged and roared the wintry tempest ,
The utmost border of his kingdom , left
Columbus found america and won a lot of fame --
And gave to sight the evanescent sound .
At this the knight gave 's breast a thump ,
Like a black ring the voice of mourning goes ,
Let all hope of grace beyond , lie there !
Up , to be squared on judgment-day .
Layes at his next , then makes a breach
That hangs before her all the year ,
Stirred the blue quiet of the italian sky ;
And let love make thee strong !
And in his waters , which your mirror make ,
So give him heroes , let the armies bleed ,
And when those deep and burning moments pass 'd ,
The memory 's soft figures melt away .
Thou stretchest forth a saving hand to keep
There clung that allegory , like a shroud .
The piercing weapon darted from the string .
And frolic hour of infancy , is met ;
But , none shall sink to everlasting woe ,
As messenger who joyful tidings bore .
Joys that once escape us fly for evermore .
Which makes the sunshine bright ; the flowers ,
Held the battle straight .
And the money comes and the money goes :
And through gray clouds give laws unto the realm ,
Protects his dust , but reverence here is paid
The slaughter of my love have planned .
He came such mischief to create
To meet the fate of poor red riding hood .
That servants hold their lofty place .
According as fortune may fix ,
The soap slides round and round ;
Thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised ,
Thyself divine , all nature owns thy might ,
Wherefore then comes thine annoyance ,
With tenderest names their hatred hide ?
Chance and impatience blast their best designs .
Mankind to gain their life and to advance ;
Only made from the breath of ukko .
The mountains do not stir , or show
Slow on the harp his hand he laid ;
For here might beauty build her summer-bower !
The silly fool ca n’t take a joke ;
Pride , malice , folly , against dryden rose ,
But hath gone calmly forth into the strife ,
For ere the bounteous autumn spreads her hues
Each tear can banish with a kiss ?
The dozen peers by that would stand condemned .
Some joy that 's gone with thee , love .
Shall to-morrow find its place .
Her light , i fear , did not shine out
It made the blood within them sing ,
Above the earth , will make some heart rejoice .
And mournful stillness reigned around ,
These tears that sink into thee ,
So time with her passed sad and drear .
Grows green and broad , and takes no care ,
And the little leaves bend their heads and weep ,
Forth from her bosom leaped a wail ,
Or wondrous wishes not yet come true ,
And each lay hold upon eternal life .
Driven by the stormy winds upon our coast ;
To seek a good each government bestows ?
The sunset thrilled her breast .
She made me weary of my life ,
And letna the sea come in . "
In vain my weary glances rove
Of thistle-seeds that wait a travelling wind .
To find the arms of my true love
And i must weeping o'er the mountains go !
One in whose eyes the smile of kindness made
But what just before him lay ,
And my bright hopes lay ruined at my feet ,
Of peace , brought in by that man crucified ,
Where never scythe has swept the glades .
And a prim green tree will take the place
The west-wind scarcely sang aloud ;
Thou hast taken the light of many suns ,
Yellow pulse-beats spreading through darkness .
Could not remove the crushing weight that sat ,
To give his tuffy some advice :
Answered in the words which follow .
He then should give them nine such grins ,
Time got his wrinkles reaping thee
Life 's dull dregs only lie .
And snatch from fate a sinking land ;
Til augst be passed and septembre ,
The elfin wind is gone
They both were cast into the dungeon 's gloom ,
The violet of purple color came ,
He finds he 's been guilty of horrid offences
The present terror rushed again ;
Sealed by her signet , felt although unseen .
On halcyon wings our moments pass ,
How cruelly thy bullets fall and smite !
That in the silence makes thy sweet eyes wild .
Pleasure had changed to care .
To cross the curious workmanship of nature
This morning the parson takes a drive .
And show ' ring light and beauty as it flies
The strong sea-daisies feast on the sun .
Which hither form the hellish fires ascend . "
Which thomas campion set to strings ,
And all were torn with the guilt of judging ,
Keeping each word of my behest
Grace abounding made him whole .
Perceived through flesh , passing like flesh away , --
And i felt my heart go cold as death ,
But his mother gives him warning :
The brazen helm , that fitted well the brow
Behold that eye which shot immortal hate ,
To which your breath gave fluctuant fuel , --
From that great river which the hills shut up ,
Fortune indeed had smiled upon me ,
The wisdom that the years have lent ,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man ,
The silence that had come o'er all ,
The buds the peach-boughs hold .
They boldly rush upon the foe ,
Else lead the other lords to deserts waste ,
When time falls fast asleep
I 'll get the v.c. sure as fate ,
Based on notes made while witnessing the fighting .
Stayed , and the spirit left his mortal frame .
Thee we ask for aid .
Though they may make corruption gape or stare ,
Of moonlight that lay stretched across the lawn :
Though poverty has struck his race ,
Before the door there lay a plot of grass ,
He 'd give consent they should wed together .
Sheer the precipice descends ,
Of moral life were drawn from schools ,
Of youth , and honour on my days impress ;
A tempest , through the cloud that dimmed her broke
A gentle hand crept in my own
And sobs strung all the beads ;
Into whose keeping christ did give the keys
The earth keeps some vibration going
Each filled its place in the designer 's plan ;
Arms that cling in pagan fashion
In the light of the setting sun , that blazed
So , so , the miles go ,
The brown west wind it sweeps the bay ,
O monarch , rise , this peril meet ;
Too often grief my soul with pangs doth wring ,
And carried northward , bound , a score .
With the night that spanned at golden gates .
It passeth its street-thunder round
That follows after prayer .
To a dynasty fallen forever . he came
As the sea feeds on , wreck and stray
That i the tenour of my creed unfold ;
That bound light bonds on you and me .
Our love shall live , and later life renew .
The heroic bosom beats no more !
Where god has girded heaven to guard
Erroneous , which in blazing ruin fell
Of the dark cliff above him , gathering flowers ,
These waves that break and yearn ,
Give to us thy friendly greetings ,
Soon in slumber found repose
I guard her beauty clean from rust .
Where weeds do grow and bush expand ,
And drank its beauty of red and blue .
Mourners , speed here your broken hearts to bring ,
For , nursed in luxury and bliss ,
Undeformed by wasting sickness . "
He nodded , and all heaven with laughter rocked ,
Stilling its mirror to her splendid snow ,
The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide ;
Where twilight loves to linger for a while ;
Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed
The winds and waves at will transport their prey ;
Or that it hardens more and helps to bind
Till on his life the sickness weighed ;
I feel as if the great white throne
With living sapphires : hesperus that led
From their parliamentary guardians set free ,
In delay there lies no plenty ;
From the rolled surf that flashed , and noted
Nature reigns and rules the whole ;
In low estate , she followed me .
On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame ,
Shall much befriend you . time shall give increase ,
And shining from thy perfect human face ,
What but sands or snows hath earth to give ?
The river winding , till we landed _ at _
Then universal greece had raised his tomb ,
Or in the full creation leave a void ,
That came to a most ignoble use --
And day sinks into slumber , cool and sweet ,
Fulofte time it falleth so ,
Which shunned the chilly light of day
Love which felt , but dared not tell ,
Age might but take the things youth needed not !
By you rascality is fed .
Set a precedent , the tale is told ,
Then turn to solitude for rest ,
So on they fared ; discourse on other themes
The far-off memory of her life resigned ,
For what the future held he did not care !
The stirring memory of a thousand years ,
And youth and age shed the tear ;
So the sad trumpets told their funeral tale
For i really could make friends with the bouquet
That ever fell on a more gracious thing .
The hills all blue with distance hide their tops
Out of the night that covers me ,
Pliant and apt , they lose no chance to show
The years go fast in oxford ,
't is more than peace you give ,
The rosy dawn again shall fill the sky .
Conjunctions join the words together --
It gives itself its glow , its light ;
Was rest still broken by the vain
While the rubbing boughs clashed rattling low .
Here flow the streams of endeavor ,
Where last i gave its tones to swell ;
We entertained a drift of leaves
Your service had his safeguard wrought .
In every wind it murmured , and i knew
Still falls upon my inward ears ,
Her will was darkened in the eclipse
They should be made to _ smart _ .
Ah when in hearts of youth it springs ,
It awes and it possesses you .
But if success i must never find ,
Retiring to her couch , shall seek repose .
And music sweetly play ,
Winged with purple , breathing flame ,
It chanced as the dawning grew to grey
Mirrors reflecting mirrors , countless and untold !
To sit upon a royal throne and reign .
And gather force for vanquishing ,
Because i saw your nerves were shaken
And fix her fears in dreadful certainty .
Evade the greeks , and leave the war behind ;
Cold he slants his eyes about ,
Alfonso first examined well their fashion ,
Take heart of grace ,
Unto my god the reverence which is meet ,
The printed page for him no meaning bears ;
The fire shot up , the martin flew ,
Dark visions haunt for her the vacant air ,
Many a wild thought surged through ares ' soul ,
And its stars beat time and sparkle
Studious to ease thy grief , our care provides
These grave auletes leads : a hundred sweep
Making the trees to tremble at his mourning ,
A lost wind whimpers in a mangled tree ;
As from a furnace , clouds of steam arise ;
For he recall 'd to mind ægisthus slain
In sweetest converse many hours would spend .
But wary makes the persons after him ,
Misfortune is not all that comes to mar ;
Mark how resistless through the floods he goes ,
A waltz , with me to guide you ,
While he the warrior 's empty blows eschews ,
Kinglike the monarch bore his fall ,
The gifts that time should rise and bring
And the light that within it lies
The spirit served by her is seen
When the gust hath blown his fill
Ever to grind to soil for grass .
“ or shall i take thy picture fair ,
Others in artful measures led the ring .
And bear it with an honest heart ,
Through the grass at his feet crept maidens sweet ,
Hold fast , though hunger make ye droop !
Now i lead a life of ease ,
Life sits with beauty and perfume
That lay in the house that jack built .
I stopped , and two beheld i show great haste
He found an author writing his life ,
Even its torn folds rose and fell
Then his eyes chanced upon his banner-bird ,
They take their shapes and creep ,
With living sapphires : hesperus , that led
Of which my comedy cares not to sing ,
His useless shaft , not daring to proclaim
Although i make her theme of this poor song .
Whether turkeys will come pretty high next thanksgiving ,
With wings that dip beyond the silver seas .
That lay in the house that jack built .
Ere i caught the low reply .
The unfortunate publicist stiffened .
That with its rich and placid verdure lay
Trees cut to statues , statues thick as trees
Your transporting chords ring out .
But where the grassy foothills opened . then ,
Who saw his power that fatal day ,
The simmer-sun was sinking down ;
Set the clouds on fire with redness ,
That fills the air
Is opening for the souls in prison !
Deceived by fortune , vanish 'd from my side .
To clutch the sun and spill its fire
The lido floats like a purple flower ;
About the trees my arms i wound ;
To vile reproach what answer can we make ?
The loftiest of life upheld by death ,
Oh , silver-clear the waves that flow ,
Their bitter tears and screams were stilled in death .
The twilight deepened -- but love came not .
Of duty nerved the loyal sentinel :
Do faces of black horror hang on high --
His silver beard , that swept his aged breast ,
Happy again when it has left them rest .
The even flags . she let herself go dreaming
As if it mark 'd the shores of hell .
The floods break their prison ,
Fury , that does not fail .
And all the flowers of life unfold ;
That taketh sins away . their prelude still
Glory shed on man and trumpet ,
Or mark the rolling year ?
From his lady 's white hand caught ;
And all his heart with pleasure filled .
To win the favour of the mighty king .
A love that shared the constancy of heaven ,
" splendour eternal , piercing through these folds ,
Was built , or paris stole the fatal greek ,
One by her country to despair was driven ;
And waits till pleasing slumbers seal his eyes .
Where fragrance baffling permeates the breeze
And the cheeks of her who bore me .
She viewed askance , rolling her restless eyne ,
He took my heart as wi ' a net ,
One time so strong , now dropping in decay ,
O life divine , that owns each waiting hour ,
Look next on greatness ; say where greatness lies ?
Orlando made his mighty worth appear .
But make answer first , who thou art ,
And man 's immortal destiny , there remains
He sought to gain the beauty rare .
And shrill their merry laughter rang .
“ give , worship , lead a life austere ,
Fainter , and fainter still , their groans arise ;
While moon goes west and sun comes east .
The milky way of peace all freshly strowed ,
The heart of youth turns ever to the light ;
Not daring yet to lift his eyes ,
On their feet with spring-vines tangled and lapped
Here turning , as to one inferior ,
The remnant , seized with sudden dread ,
The central host to cheer and guide .
And lead us where the wild boar lies .
Whose insight makes all others dim :
Or ingrained servitude extinguished it .
Bright as the summer , italy extends ;
And mangled bore away the sinewy part .
This brought fred taylor 's story to the murder ,
Have had the time the bridge to pass .
The peace infring 'd proceeded first from you ;
Some kill their love when they are young ,
Like some great monarch with his train has passed .
Of demons sweeping past it to their prison .
With a long-kindling gaze that caught from hers
Fretting the narrow path , her eggs conveys ;
In the trees the wind westering moved ;
Abortive , blindly to destruction hurled ;
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield .
Who comes unbidden , making hearts to mourn .
The western tide crept up along the sand ,
Their journey still when his boughs shrink with age .
Iku-turso gave this answer :
And deathlike was the calm which stood around ,
Black terror seizes them ; blood freezes into ice
A foe that longs my life to take ,
Where a speckled beauty lies
Where the rat memory does its burrows make ,
When god hath taken her whom heaven gave .
When the dark streets appeared to heave and gape ,
The snows shall pass from our graves away ,
And stands the centre and the soul of all :
In which the water it was made of fails ,
And the sunbeams gave them welcome .
Or a mother 's arms caress them .
It came forth . and if he had a woman
All felt the common joy they now must feign ,
For out of the west shall the poets come .
The which my drama cares not to rehearse ,
A car triumphal : on two wheels it came
My life has passed in torment and in tears ,
Your duty plainly then before you stands ,
Silver sun , whom god has fashioned ,
No fault do i find , my faithful lover ,
That the white clouds build in the breezy sky .
Every heart is strung with fears ,
And made me master of our english law ,
And all unwiped shall stand
The sun and winds upon the slopes hold sway ,
Thou canst not take the love away
Truth from error to discern :
Alone gives fearful access to the place ;
Our way we held , more rugged than before ,
The results that follow this forced union .
That opened in a mountain ’s side .
But the sun will permit no white to sparkle ;
Change can but dim the glory of its youth ;
Moulded the dimness , fixed , defined
For couples crowned with flowers that burn in dew .
Unwise to stir his wrathful mood
His rhymes , can voice the tides of love ?
But read her thought to speed the race ,
Foul usury doth not more lift itself
' the gallant champions of your fame shall rise .
Amend what flaws may lurk ,
Cheerless i heave the lonely sigh --
The window darkens as the hours swing round ;
Whereby to you great harm might grow :
To loose his grasp on poland 's throat ;
And as it hung there , vivid and unreal ,
And much of that fair town to ruin brought ;
The south wind spoke a lie that day ;
Farewell thy armes , made kindly to embrace ,
That no evil enter there ,
With tears , too , swelled his eyes ,
He fills me with such wonder and despair !
Never bore so lofty a brow !
Was not exactly made to cry , }
The world would call a poet . he may sing
As ever she saw in her life .
While bending nations to that monarch bring
To keep the beam of battle straight !
Worship beyond his own should gain .
So industry may reap reward .
So gathers the descending rain
The chords that fall caressfully ,
The passage broke that land from land divides ;
Long ere his thoughts have taken form .
Its surplus brought to nonplus presently !
It grows with my thoughts for mould ,
Stems the upbursting cold : a wild rose tree
Cold and sullen grew the panther ;
Have borne me many a musing time ,
And something tells me thou wilt never wake ,
For he , that conduit running wine of song ,
Still through the hazy mist of stealing sleep ,
Then laugh and laugh till the fat tears roll
Whitely rise the stately lilies
As if to him the winds their thunder threw ;
Whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps ,
With moral discourses cut shorter the way :
The trembling of her lips , as though she bore
Yea , love 's great warrant runs not there :
Triumphant is the shout that comes
Still o'er him rose those melancholy stars !
The tale of love some other tongue must tell ,
But my body caught up in the whirl and drift
Sent his warning of the winter ,
Draw forth the cheerful day from night ;
" bridegroom , give thy bride instruction ,
Shared among petty kings too far removed ;
Of kośala the hero went .
Four maiden hands in theirs shall lay .
By those who had the gospel 's sound regarded .
Some wandering touches , some reflected light ,
In banff has genius found regard
Surely thy spirit of sense rose up to greet
Her softening heart will turn to me . ”
But pa says , on deeply considering the thing ,
If i could get two thousand for one tale ,
A gentle calm did follow .
And in my heart i hear a voice that calls
And feeding on my sorrow , hate at last
As rumour said , the cruel victor asked
May not touch grief with his memorial ray ,
Rules only make it hard to live .
With cheers swelling and swelling , to run and turn
His tombstone thus should speak for him . and surely
" that to the full thy knowledge may extend
Feeling it break , with bleeding groans they pine ,
The garden-bed come crocuses
Well might you read his sickness in his eyes ,
Wha 'd rise in the mornin ' early ?
The law on stony tablets writ
Careful to see the mantling bliss go round ;
Thine eyes being purged by tears of righteous rage
But when the soul broke faint from its eclipse ,
Avenging ; this shall surely come to pass .
It came , you know , with fire and smoke
Against each prince now she had held her own ,
Of waves that fall in onset or that strive .
Through a chill not born of autumn .
To new appearance . meeting these , there came ,
Then to low sobs and murmurs died away ,
Their old , familiar carols play ,
My life hangs on that sweet , sweet lip ,
Where man starves man for gain ,
For dubious meanings , learned polemics strove ,
Was going , and one following the priesthood ,
It dance as they go blowing by .
Now see how each maintains his bloody cause .
When storm-surges our ship might whelm ,
What memories they bring to me ,
The traveller to a shelter , summon 'd him
Talk not of wasted affection , 169 .
The tempest bell of music rang . the boy
We shall be made to dearly rue it .
On boughs forbidden where no curses hang :
Reject all gifts that come from higher powers .
What dreams , what ambitions came thronging
Which feeds on tears even to the very grave ,
The world may scream with iron tongue in vain ,
In voices mingled with sweet melody .
God will mete as we may measure .
The second night they reach the river black ,
Love everywhere will find us .
Their brows flash fast on me from gliding cars ,
Of any worship wake some thoughts divine .
To look on truth unbroken , and entire ;
One is racked with wasting pain ,
Who took up their line of marching ,
Cantoned throughout the winter months had lain ,
Of heroes gone ! against his proper glory
And into the guarded place bright poured the day .
A fragile thing , her lightest wish was heeded .
The beautiful and good . god gives
Before your chance is gone ?
Her face assumed an expression of ineffable serenity .
Winter spreads it with folds of snow .
And draw the wine of day
And christianity a dream we 've lost ,
" the years are as a tale gone past .
Thir earnest eyes they fix 'd , imagining
That brought the sunset on each crumbling crest ,
But turkey caught them up at last ,
When the sweatin ' troop-train lay
Some pageant which takes tears and i must foot with
When the tired nation breathed from civil war .
And fall the sounds of mirth
Could i have turned my thoughts away from her .
I made a wish that i might feel his kiss
Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound ;
With joy the tidings brought from heaven : at length
Where earliest thy sweet enchantment falls ,
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell .
Yet borne up within by courage unflinching ,
Thy smile gives me back to the skies
On mutual wants built mutual happiness .
The seasons thus a plaything made for thee ?
And take to duelling or thumping tetes ;
The world went round about ,
Some stars will rise and wane ,
The franklin he hath gone to roam ,
While down the river we float on forever ,
Of the fear that followed ; ever again
When eighty-three came into play ,
Which the defence hath undertake .
That graced my maiden tourney .
For those next me in glory placed ,
Then plunged he in the flashing tide .
I am prepared to admonish that he quit
By wealth in easy circumstances placed .
There are hearts which never falter , 29 .
My soul arises moaning in the night .
And onward he staggers in passion and pain .
He made thy fame and fortune rise ,
And when the spring comes , winter sped ,
Unmoved i stand what wind may blow .
There she reflected on the fool she 'd been ,
How did they keep his birthday then ,
As the wind comes to the pine ,
Till they should leave their blessing on my head ;
Lost favour back again , and closed the breach .
A sense of desolation creeps ;
Ruined in battle for some lost high cause .
Soft pity oh , give me a tear
But the high charity , that makes us servants
To scratch dirt over scandal for money ,
They poured that music to the earth .
For she gave a hissing sound ,
With dandelions roaring ,
Give life its praise or blame :
For they have laid in rest their lances keen :
We hung upon the desperate fight ,
It grew , a starlit flag unfurled !
Across mine image came the maiden 's face ,
With england 's chivalry at dawn to ride ;
Thy billowing rebellion ' gainst its ease ,
Reaped fortune by a rise in merchandise ,
Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze .
At dawn in silence moves the mighty stream ,
So may one word dispel a cloud of tears .
Sun , the sky puts forth no hand
Sands with which sea-billows play , --
She sees herself a queen of song once more ;
Between blind walls its secret hid from view ,
To the marchioness comes a courtier :
The son of raghu gave assent ,
He cast a hasty look on each
That thou miht take remembrance ,
Nor by new fears made tame ,
Whilst on thy lips the placid smile that played ,
And the sooner the soul falls broken ,
Steals up so softly that one feels alone !
Since summer 's garishness is gone ,
My heart flows like a sea ,
But from his side bounded a shape as light
And , learnt from spies , the tidings brought .
And thus allow for poor mortality .
To put rapport the mountains and rocks and streams ,
Affection 's best ties round my bosom were spun ;
The gossips met in purring bands ,
Lyste to shede thy blood ,
The silence deepened ; and i tried to speak
Over the starry border glooms that bound
Come hither and take your choice ,
To satan first in sin his doom applied ,
The drowned sun sank and died . he lay
A song that shall bid my heart rejoice
He steers , till fairer breezes fall .
My garden dreams by its trees .
For which to them great thanks i give ,
Hope with grief , and death may part
It will make thee tall and queenly ;
" but the fire arose in fury ,
Even as i watched the daylight how it sped
And autumn came not with its fruit ,
And are you torn with rapture and with woe ?
Where rome embraced her heroes ? -- where the steep
And stand a barrier to eternity .
" and flowers put forth a fairer hue ,
An instrument of discovery . it reveals
That so much of the heart reveal ,
Open thy mind to that which i reveal ,
Made splendid by the dying sun .
In vain the heaving tide of mourning rolls ,
A light that shifts , a glare that drifts ,
But his mother gives him warning :
Recalled , revived , and kept ,
Show me where the lost ones go ;
The king of men shall rise in public sight ,
Makes him believe that other not to be
Makes havoc of their desecrated dust
Then closed her access to the wealthiest farms ,
Has never wept or heaved a sigh ,
Or waded through a scene of blood ,
Victorious he his mighty triumph holds ,
Their banner spread , and knights on horseback leapt ,
Thou wert not made for sorrow ,
Their ring of smoky red could only show
And fell straightway to sighing for the past ,
Or where the birds made riot of their glee
All nature grows unearthly ; all things seem
The title-pages bore his name ;
Had bound up the sight of his disaster
Then to the crowded circus forth they fare :
The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn ,
Whose deadly point thy heart shall cleave . ”
As every rising wave his dread renew 'd ;
When hostile elements with rage resound ,
The shades of panchavaṭí seek ;
That with provision meet the dead may pass
A gracious pension only saves the third ! --
What gift of loving may i give to call
Which never yet made lean man fat .
In growing happiness ? shall i throw by
Darker , darker , grow the shadows :
Of wild-rose sprays , that runs away
O fate , what evil wind you blow .
And carries grief where'er he goes : --
I to mine end will still go on .
Have wrought in thee ; surely but thirty years ,
And all the choral water sang .
Doubt and remorse steal out to join them .
And every sigh the heart breathes out
Beside this corpse , that bears for winding sheet
And their beauty wantonly bared
And glistening fields and apples dimmed with dew .
And all our past be covered with regret .
For the dark pine that kept
Uplifts a general cry for guilt and wrong ,
So would it last an april through
And silks that flutter in and out ,
Of fighters , each found able as a man
And may delight and joy doth bring :
“ to me , what deity before us stands ,
And forth the hurtling weapon went .
The sun was sunk , and after him the starr
That would follow him in suns to come .
His own and rhea 's son like measure found ;
More pangs than tongue or heart can frame
After the wave is lost in the full sea .
An awful sound that moment rose
Decked by the ivy 's green lace ,
It brings back that winter of mad delights ,
By giving us occasion to manifest our love .
Then gave three fourers in the slips --
And now i find thee living , i will pour
Are dissolved in the tears which have flooded
How much of godhood did it take --
First spring -- upon whose head a wreath was set
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell .
A little boy was set to keep
His nearer step , but flying left the gates
Long years have passed since the place was burned ,
Pure waters wandered o'er its breast ,
It flickered out and left the darkest night .
All that now breathe the universal air ,
A sunbeam pointing out each secret thought !
I feel thine embrace .
If every rose with gold were tied ,
And joy came into the farmer 's face ,
When faith in its future grows .
And gave commandment to the bands
Heaven lies about us and we see the hall ,
And will give thee my best counsel .
Of sin is the light that leads us downward --
Each side , and saves the blossom so
The golden fish heard every word as it lay ,
The mind is riveted , the gaze is spent
Ower hieland hearts secure he reigns ;
Far above where day is breaking ;
Can here life 's measure hold !
Warm , rich hues that gladden sight ;
And we can not go to sleep ;
Such draughts of power ever take .
Drawn by the rumour of such carnage , came
He , to get the warm side inside ,
Her towards whom it made
From selfish cares , and growing lust of gain
I take his words to mean
It drives them : hope of rest to solace them
Shame folded up in blind concealing night ,
But stir not up my anger in my grief ;
Something to give even sorrow a grace ,
And a weak man may conceal him .
Take my blessing on thy going . "
Which the curse of christendom should follow .
Thee shall i reckon priest ? strange priest is he
But fast comes on the day that ends
Their words come to .
Come , fold me closer to thy pulsing heart .
I would the sultan 's throne then fill .
Dead ! where the valleys sink
Will long pursue my hated name ,
Can man by reason 's beam be led astray ?
When my dear friend , who gave the feast ,
And shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind :
For ony wife i see ;
They bring their own reward :
The changed and dreadful moon was throwing down
Of what the warrior had pursued is gone .
That liberty would with them come .
All of the best he takes that may appear :
On war 's own heart direct the sudden blow ;
Of the sacrament , set forth this evening .
But weeping ever sat by hector 's grave ,
Of many ships and stout , a squadron lay ;
Years come round , and years fly onward ,
And through the dance meandering glide ;
The lilacs where the robin built ,
_ the world is overstocked with men _
So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom .
But silence falls with fading day ,
And that , dear governor , flies to thee !
At each wild word to feel within
The charms that ne'er can fade arise --
But when within the walls our troops take breath ,
Soft clouds that float and cling
The while the moon slips into shadow-land .
Fair freedom rose new-england to adorn :
Like silver moons the pale narcissi lay :
Then pray to god to cast that wish away .
Now in mute stillness rested all the air :
Shedding soft tears : hast thou some tidings brought
To make passionate longing understood
Would you but take it drop by drop ,
To hearth where love hath ceased to blaze :
( the fussy lanes ran wrong )
Full lusty he was to bear
Ruffle the dark . the little lives that lie
Where salt the waters of the tiber grow ,
" here to repair , and hold high festival ,
With furious words he mingled blows .
Thir earnest eyes they fix 'd , imagining
Then into tears of joy the father broke ;
Where members of one lord no creed shall sever ,
And waters sighing on the river-bed .
And draws the spirit most unto itself ,
At least would bring down heaven to her .
A faith that is knowledge shall rise and grow .
There came at noonday or beneath the stars
That help to make the artist .
Again led on by ajax , who in form
As comforts on earth can be found ;
When they are dust with dusty things that pass .
And utterance found before my god in prayer .
Must turn all tasks to charity .
What terror can have seized thy breast
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw :
And far , calm waters set in lonely plains ,
The wind comes .
Nay , keep your temper ; for i can
He aimed at power to overthrow the state .
Astonishment takes from us sense of pain ;
To left or right , to catch a novel form
That moves them all as one .
My servants true shall find , in me ,
Shall meet one atom that was you .
And give due thanks to jesus the king . "
And she thought of christ , who stilled the wave
No fault in women to lay on
Whose winds the gray norns keep , --
Made her the flower of knightly age gone by .
O sacred muse , my haughty thoughts inspire ,
But leave no light within the heart .
So many a happy day they spent ,
From those worse things the wind is moaning of .
To break the heathen and uphold the christ ,
O man , that from thy fair and shining youth
Let but one beam of glory on it shine ,
In eden 's flowery gardens gathered new .
With fiction then does real joy reside ,
Hot vasques follow 'd fast and far .
Its music , lest it should not find
Superfluous matter came , shot out in ears
And the laughing stream as it runs along
That made him throw his bare legs out of bed
Hacks us thus cruelly , slivering again
Where the priest 's pall hangs rent on rome ,
Is founded every virtue , came to thee . "
And waking sentience struggles there .
From taking with angelica delight , --
That time and the world shall never move . "
And then it told all about its youth .
The pale which held that lovely deer :
Like the soft light , softly mingled .
Song that swoons and sinks with care ?
As up at last the great sun drew ,
Reflect , thy choice with judgment make ,
God shows himself . and i have known
And see how much thy memory we love ,
And lightly went his way , of arms bereft .
Though i the orient never more shall feel
There underneath , not made by torments sad ,
Each hour , in passing , hoarsely sings .
Of scripture hold supreme authority .
Which yet doth make my world more bright .
From whence come such unto the written word
The fair white rose has faded
Their snowy hues the fragrant blossoms spread ;
I freight them with my untold dreams ;
At his touch he felt new courage
There comes again the old heart pain
And in words like these expressed him :
And intermingled temples rise between . ]
The linnets play among the leaves
Within her hair slept all the gold
Their gates wide open threw .
The water turn to wine :
His sire and duty ’s law obeyed ,
In thy dear self i find --
For fear had fallen on all , when reappear 'd
And night comes on with wind and rain ;
Nor set in bonds imagination .
The proud french quarter of days long gone ,
Live buds that warbled like a rivulet
Then , with those charms which heighten life ,
My very heart had died in me of shame ,
This is a promise made in the spring .
The tempted , tempter turned ;
On rear and center . saturn could not stem
Rode for his hunting-palace , where they set
And , as the skilled musician made the words
The street lamps watched the empty square ,
And cowering foes shall shrink beneath
Moons waxed to fullness and to sickles waned .
For , dear me , why abandon a belief
With angry taunts he drove the gather 'd crowds .
I see the wintry breakers roll
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move ;
With twilight it again came on to blow ,
And sets light hope on fire ;
Symons has pointed out , the medieval atmosphere of
Great guns let it blow , high or low ,
Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses ,
Crimson and scarlet the heavens suffuse
And their blood runs unto death ;
See how small room my infant lord doth take ,
And steels his bosom to the orphan 's tears
Round , round , while thus we go round ,
The woman whom i used to spurn ,
In slumber wore the heavy night away ,
Where honour has the world to gain ,
Is a home prepared for me ,
Some wandering touches , some reflected light ,
From heat and toil a sabbath made .
Drives home the blow and makes the battle sure .
Into each life some rain must fall ,
Give me assurance that thou still art nigh ,
Joy shone from mary 's loving heart ,
And cast the dark foundations deep ,
Which takes therefrom vitality and power .
And when the autumn takes his annual round ,
That shook with horror at thy fall .
We are used to see , that man despises
And bitter tears for amycus he shed ,
Tho ' a wide compass round be fetched ;
Her sway , he into exile seems to chase :
I must forego the pride i felt therein .
Church government shall settled be ,
And merrier sped the christmas game ,
That wolsey 's voice the blessing spoke ,
Of grazing which the meadows give --
In these fierce words an utterance found :
Bring their tribes to fell destruction .
Full many an anguish 'd bound he gave ,
" i see . but since christmas ? "
Till they have gathered the new melody .
To griefs that on the surface swim ;
Of springy clouds , and bore straight on toward
On whom even mother earth closed all her portals ,
A spirit false did with vain plaints betray ;
Smoothing the path as it still winds on
Against my brother rushed and fought ,
So , compassing a mighty round , they fare
Rose-radiance smites the solitudes ,
If winds so fast bring storms from heavens wide :
To guha as he pressed and prayed ,
O land wherein all powers are met
His name and royal race proclaimed .
The pang of separation hurts her more and more .
The years are slowly creeping on
And sorrow that succeeded .
The picture of his love looked down on him ;
To mark its structure and to note the scale
Our hearts that follow as children led .
If mercy fail , yet let my presents move ,
Which from the della pera took its name !
A mighty blow , that made a gaping wound ,
But we left him alone with his glory .
She watched each dying hope she found ;
Where the rose-pink robe had flown ,
And jumped the cold out of their rags ;
Great music under heaven is made ,
His feeble outline met the gaze .
Cast every doubt and weight away ;
Thy beauty shall no more be found ,
Nor find the same foods equally delightsome --
And all these sounds familiar to them come ,
There was a time when softer feelings held
Her plumage preened the yet unplucked
And dealt the empire out . alone of men ,
My solitary room i gain .
Such the commands _ religion _ gave ,
For that the surface gives no hints ,
Takes time to grow ,
But , no whir staggered by its whirlwind rush ,
That steep and narrow scale admits to climb .
Soon as it suited the heathen oneidas !
And royal feudal europe sails with thee .
Wild warfare he maintained .
To steal the staff he put such trust in ;
And seemed to mark the waves below ;
The trepidation talked , and that first moved ;
Their sail directed for the samian coast
Death , horrid death designing for them all .
Perhaps you 'll warmly take their part ?
That draw their curtains closer round ,
And kind friend luth engaged awhile in prayer ,
Nor wounded heart that ever bled --
So upon every side the sinners stood ;
" if she be made of white
No courage to uplift thee from despair
For shade to shade will come too drowsily ,
In times to come , communion sweet to share ,
And launch your hearts with lamentable wounds
An ' time brought round october zun , --
Clamor of contest ran fierce and high , --
( such flames of doom were spouting ) ,
Of solomon , it scratched a magic knot ;
And soon it rose on every tongue
And hail the cloud with lifted voice .
No feint the arts of war can show ,
But as opinions were divided ,
Yet has a heart dares hope to prove
But this is certain -- that i feel
Should i endeavor , with this striving brain ,
Are brought : and feel by turns the bitter change
So many centuries since the blood was shed .
Here memory mocks the toil of genius . christ
To you i make this sad appeal ;
And ever her strength on mine shall lean ;
Upon its pure unfolding sunshine steals ,
So much he saw -- he found he could insure
Self-moved , the chariot came ,
One hope alone brought fondly back ,
Here finds perfection from the builder 's hand ,
But what the editor demands , he shows ;
Who see salvation , progress in restraint ,
It stood the archetype sublime
By their white sails betray 'd to nightly view ;
There he hath never loved her nor hath led :
" because in wickedness and vice were bred
Nor is it won by glittering wealth ,
That which once set every sense on fire ,
Than see the hand of violence invade
And shadows lie deep on the plain ,
( heart , how the seasons fly ! )
Where shall we find a father to attend , --
To feel thee is such real bliss ,
Upon the wave that bears it .
King báli came in fury out ,
Thus she gave the youth instructions :
The fiery curse his tainted frame devoured .
Saw his bright image mirrored in the blade
Till it fell ones in a morn of may
" see how much more fair
This for an instant and the flame is gone .
I woke , and found that life was duty .
Of life god sets in limpid gold --
They wondered how miss bourne would take it .
Shalt thou swift vengeance take
Maiden ! let us share each other 's kisses !
Taking love for her chief pleasure .
Thy tongue a tale of spring doth tell ,
What saved these states from britain 's wasting hand ,
More weird the scene had grown and wild ;
Then came the vision of the night before
What charming scenes attract the eye ,
Hair , that suggests the bible braids of ruth ,
In view of anguish deep we then must feel .
They with their father hold perpetual feast
Of expectation linger as it flies ;
The battle winks and thuds in blundering strife .
When sorrows come to one and all ?
A shower descends , and the sun , opening
When now the north his boisterous rage has spent ,
Without being to the same conclusion led .
To his faint body strength and vigor gave .
While she all her love discloses ,
How may we be released from memories ?
That the silent teardrops make ;
Still humming on , their drowsy course they keep ,
To god and reason left the works they made .
May swell the grandeur , or discharge the wrath ,
With water strove the approaching flames to chase :
The very leaves of the trees lay still ;
Lone nature feels that she may freely breathe ,
Yea , borne away by passion ’s storm ,
Nor was my hope that night made less ,
The meaner victims ’ bodies blazed :
The sad devastation that time has made there ;
Like whirlwinds dash 'd around .
And through the matted brambles found a way
An ’ crying can not bring her back ;
The lean shoal told to me .
The militant angels , whose sabres drive home
To buoy his spirits or sustain his nerves .
And england 's priestcraft shakes to hear
And yet they take least heed of bitter wind
Not other laws and other pacts to make .
Like forcin shutters ran ,
Is arachel , the which men note ;
Where death and glory a joint sabbath keep ,
The darkness came to hide my tears and share
Till the name of frost was given
White sails lean along the waves leaping green .
You gave me pleasant thoughts to dwell upon ,
In lonely trance by bliss is given ;
There do the hideous harpies make their nests ,
My soul remembers its lost paradise ,
Nor attend to the blast ;
Of world-wide empires , england stood alone .
There the tall forest falls -- that indian mound
What thy commanding soul shall put it to ;
The birds took the notes , on their boughs above
And dreams in storms its peace to find !
How will it fade with sun and storm !
To hear the judge give sentence on the throne ,
As comes to seamen when they dream of seas .
Fortune a double ball doth often throw .
Those unborn hours that surely follow after
The mountain road goes up and down ,
Contented each went to his daily cares ;
Red fox made a swing . she fastened
And his mother watched him hang for the felony .
Than when the name reproachfully was cast
An owl took , in a barn , a station
Thy hatred only wakes a smile ;
O realm ! whose glorious fields are spread between
In wanton frolic lifts the trembling veil ;
The fragile mist of fair deceit that lay
As everywhere it works in peace ? cabals ,
I gave the boys money to start in business .
The basest weed outbraves his dignity :
His hours , as well as practice , keep ?
And pour a shower of mellow kisses there .
Than cherished memories , healed every smart
What new columbus take the helm !
Thereon i made my moan ,
By greater gifts to come . for now the air
Whence came delightsome bodies , soaring minds ,
The man has found no comfort in the grave .
To find its meaning is my meat and drink .
This raging heat has kindled in thy breast .
Swept till over them sweeps the sorrow
And fill thy loneliness that lies apart
Black coats and brown coats thrusting and spurring
A single tear upon his eyelash staid
And more than a hundred spirits sat within .
The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
Behind me lay in shadows the sublime
To blood unshed the rivers must be turned ;
Her other arts exhausted all , she framed
In the little village shared .
As on the day her beauty brought to birth
Their happiness revealed .
Red rose leaves will never make wine ? "
I sing this song , borne all along
Her " man " the air is killing --
Whiffs of delectable fragrance swim by ;
Nae travel makes him weary .
I cherish his because in me it bides :
And to the holy spirit , " rang aloud
She made the conqueror pause : and he who seized
And balmy slumbers steal into your breast ;
As though they count past kindness of avail ,
The unborn child is given a dower of hate .
When , dangers past , the grateful tongue employ .
Lo ! turnus comes , and greedy torches brings
There came a tinkling from the waking fold ;
While of us franks but very few i count ;
And spring has given love a flower to hold ,
By thousands , angel on arch-angel rolled ;
Caught him , and crying threw her arms around :
There fell a hot coal ,
The wondrous ages pass like rushing waves ,
Of his breath with the waltz became blurred .
' evil only comes from evil ,
With trembling haste i execute thy wrath , --
To ride on one 's religion through the lobby ,
O reverence ! let reason swim ;
That told the wedded one her peace was flown .
A prophet 's words can never fail --
But the breeze of the morning blew , and found
The short proud lip showing thy race , thy cheeks
I stood like one that had received a blow :
The king held talk with his chief in war .
Therewith he passage made himself and place ,
While simple melody pour 'd moving on the heart .
Beauty runs virgin in the woods
Echoed the prophecy that sir john had made ,
There honour comes , a pilgrim-gray ,
Over the stones where the fountain broke .
A thrush made gladness musical
A car triumphal : on two wheels it came
The grey clouds flecked with orange are and gold ,
To fall and crush the tyrants and the slaves
When histories charm to think that histories lie !
At last one night it chanced
That the last post is given unto you ,
Fill empty gorge on gorge with echoes calling .
The breezes were so spent with winter blowing
But on the rigid beauty awe was seen ,
For each a stintless welcome sees ,
Light has been given you for good and evil ,
What help could hermes ' rod unto him give ,
Tell her the joyous time will not be stayed ,
While the kindling of life in his bosom remains ,
Without boor and burger skinning alive . ”
Yet rested not clorinda 's working thought ,
With what shall suit thee better , and the gift
But the best courage man has ever shown
When they come true , then i believe in them
And manners profligate were rarely found ,
And followed the flag till i saw it raised
Where no star of dusk has taken
For grief exacts each penny of its toll .
Make slow pursuit , or altogether balk
Like one that had been led astray
Love that holds high discourse within my mind .
They conjure strange tales , rarely read ,
And eased of unrest your heart shall be ,
Ah no ! achilles meets a shameful fate ,
Dire destiny laid hold upon the son ,
Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms .
" make room , make room for a faithful heart
Around his brow thick smoke-clouds rolled
Ye wake to feel your beauty going ;
He 'd make the music hum ,
And hollow whistled in the rocky cave .
Your flocks will not be straying .
That stone came rolling grandly to the tee
The which was made a happy bride
' thwart shadows that fall dim and dimmer
There came into many a burgher 's pate
Restlessly strayed up to heaven ,
Sweetheart , have i laughed lightly and made cheer ,
" who shall this marriage make ? "
Near to the hermit ’s home he drew ,
Mixed with the funeral is the wildered wail
The saucy surrender she made at the gate .
The quiet valley smiles beneath its beams ,
Therefore to weep because thy course is run ,
Drive home the blade . unless the slain be known
To meet the boughs not swung too high .
Filled with delight three summer morning hours .
Where life is withered by sin 's deadly breath .
But that enormous barrier binds it fast .
The baths at aix great companies attract ;
The feelings i would share ,
But , first , to make my gratitude appear ,
Till her tears rose up beneath his smile .
Confusion on thy banners wait ;
Was al set in an other wise .
Back to my mind my former error came .
On the thick gloom by sorrow round us cast ;
And froze the genial current of the soul .
The crane his homeward journey keeps .
Through light clouds flash 'd the fitful gleam
And when december came , fouling the ways ,
With a pint he washed down his discourse ,
A few false tears are shed , and then ,
One real pleasure that was left :
And expressed itself in this wise :
And by contrasted beauty shining more )
Misfortunes all his life attend ,
And cast a cloud of crimson , silently ,
Vain tears , alas ! and sighs that never find
And redly ran his blushing waters down .
Among the trembling firs strange ways it took .
And the shadows go ;
So far dissension ruled the pair ,
But life shall on and upward go ;
Melody resigns to fate .
Through all the round a vessel came in sight .
For o , my heart on this is set ,
With your minds on money turning ,
But that such helping grace from god was given .
As soun tofore the song is set
Here , where the mimic eagle glared in gold ,
To plunge the lustful , crawling fingers down ,
Be fate 's smile directed !
Above restraint the tide of sorrow rose ;
" and it comes from employing a quack ,
And heaven drew back behind the battle-clouds .
Where two fair cities rise with equal pride .
And very light that light discovers by .
Which with his teares were bred :
Onward the heaving citadels of spain ,
The firelight falls on your vacant chair ,
The thick leaves where their cradles lie ,
And the noose floats free for all ? '
My wretchedness could plainly show .
Through every ring the victor arrow went .
That flashed , -- and died away .
True hell , or light hath told a lie ,
And some made coxcombs nature meant but fools
Guilty and good may encounter the test ;
The flashes come and go ;
Instant to young telemachus he press 'd ;
Which ages thought of happy times ,
And passing rich with forty pounds a year .
The subtle bonds of death around us twine .
" the clouds are passing far and high ,
Proudly hath the orient sprung ;
Where filial love with virgin sweetness joined .
A sympathetic chord is touched that finds expression there ;
Let no tears or offerings move thee ,
These eyes had seldom shed a tear --
And glory that may make it heaven to thee .
Answered in the words which follow :
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn ;
He with his lord took on anew .
Whose open page lay on thy dying heart ,
Or where the sunny waters fall
Eyes were shot on her that froze
The chamber , where his hearts delight did lie ,
And snatch from fate a sinking land ;
Having with him stablished his tyranny ,
And , impotent of anger , finds no way
The preacher went and took his text : --
Had visited that troubled soul of thine ,
Never may from our souls one truth depart --
Saying my sin made father 's heart to bleed ,
Nor feared from virtue ’s path to stray ,
To get the killing-place transfixed ,
Filling the air with fragrance sweet .
Onward he flies , nor fixed as yet the goal
" ' voice that breathed o'er eden " --
Ripening there it lay beneath
A lovely devil ; a crowned lust that cried
Let us shake off dull reason 's incubus ,
Prove to thy weakness a sustaining friend ?
( which saw all western things with small surprise ,
To accompany the hag where'er she wound .
Detain from following thy illustrious track .
They stretch and turn and take their rest .
Where chitrakúṭa ’s heights arise
" now i take the tongue of otso ,
And fear to flow ,
Thus talking of that peasant we approach 'd
And poured forth what their spirits felt ,
On such occasions wine 's oft made to flow --
Of all her joy had stood few hours ago ;
His eyes still fixed upon the ghosts , he reached
To press his gory hands ;
Him , filled with such compassion and such grief ,
It flew , and a cracked voice his business there
Where life knows death , and where poor glory meets
The wind alone it is makes every sound ,
Let us make friends with the stars ;
" if she be made of white
It chanced one day , when the north wind blew
Who looks to them for help , a fugitive ,
Say , in the tasks reality has brought ,
Before thy days their summer-course have run ,
And thence the foreign radiance is reflected ,
Have you had a kindness shown ?
Till the darkness falls around us ,
And with him came the stock which grew him --
He soothed her ; but lest pity go beyond ,
Let the slow clouds and leaves above me float
Paling or flushing as fear raced
Shall i look to ease my grief ( jones )
Endangered states may yield to terms unjust ;
The great judge took his judgment-cap ,
The way led through a fragrant starlit park ,
The teasing burden of his foe to take ;
Of the old crime his hand had wrought ,
And all that mighty heart is lying still !
And her awful light around me breaking ,
And the great sea opened and swallowed pain ,
Some bearded meteor , trailing light ,
There taste that life of life -- immortal love .
Whence light 's golden presence throws his
Back to the merchant 's his way he took ,
And show my love by yielding him his due ;
The earth in shadow lies .
This man who loves , grasps hold of gold ,
Clouds will pass that fleck my sky ,
Thus the nameless fish made answer :
The morning stars the treble led
The fiend who made my heaven a hell ,
Fondly we think we honor merit then ,
And drew the wicked shepheard to his will .
A monument they 'll raise for glory .
First he made the holy cross-sign ;
An ’ chase each doubt an ’ fear .
He therefore should have wished to pass
Those trades which help so mightily her cause !
Into that shadow-world that lies somewhere --
There come a brief pause in the raging heat --
Pictured the bliss should welcome his return .
Vulnant she felt
Thus addressed the ancient louhi :
I see the constructiveness of my race ,
Gathering new courage as it found
But saw no way to what he sought .
Sat where a river rolled away ,
Of a love that once gave it ,
Would god show favour to an older son
Of justice , that doth macerate them so .
They dealt full many a wound ;
That this cup of grief might pass me ,
Love 's light summer-cloud sweetly shall cast .
Hear the cool lapse of hours pass ,
And , as i thought of years departed --
The flames against the kindlers backward cast :
And have i not his red salute withstood ?
And pegasus , too , is run by meter ,
Shouldered me pelion with its swinging pines ,
By all that wrings the heart of sin ,
His heavier arms lay scatter 'd on the plain :
Loving and confiding i hither came along ,
Might shoot a sweetness through her own !
That i should get sic exaltation ,
Out of the gale a fiercer fury spun .
Soul wearies soul , i find .
Come with fresh airs breathing the faint perfume
Set glorious rumors floating , till the ear
After armida false were followed hot ,
The sunsets flushed its western windows red ;
That second breuse sans pity did remain ;
Expressed the gravest doubts and fears ;
Upstairs there lies a sodden thing
From a kingly house descended ,
Then the black water as it goes crieth ,
How the melodious winged hours flew ;
Like april calling to the seed in earth ;
And jersey boats , though begged to land ,
Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll 'd ;
At the caddle she found herself in .
No hope arose of being freed .
Rose from their graves wild gestures making .
Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat ?
But if thy whimpering looks do ask me why ,
Did i with lust the fatal strife sustain ,
What is the issue ? let us see !
The marble spires of milan wound the air ,
I for my honour make this sole request ;
Stands the great convent .
Beneath cold ismarus our vessels bore .
By idle fancies led astray ,
Ye trees that fade when autumn-heats remove ,
For thy sweet priests to lean and pray upon ,
He clutched at emptiness -- she was not there ;
As it beats below on a barren shore .
So it went on with its life
Now he melted them to pity .
When all in mist the world below was lost .
All valiant dust that builds on dust ,
Thou art to all lost love the best ,
The blast may sink in mellowing rain ;
Far nearer here you 'll light upon the franks ;
Death 's eyeless sockets glared upon them all ,
You 've struck a spring of tears !
Into the windy dark where shines no light ;
The mighty shadow is borne along ,
And the daisies and violets beginning to blow ,
He challenged fate to race .
It passes . frantic , fleeing death ,
And put the sense of wetness in the air .
When grace to slay is given .
To unlock the heart , and let it speak ?
The place he found beyond expression bright ,
To carry far the colours of his queen ,
Hath got a great train of artillerie :
Ilk man and mother 's son take heed ;
“ her daring crime increasing , proud she sets
And having drunk , we raise a shout
Because the thought of avallon still clings
And the high race of which he came .
In the dark the river spins ,
And night brings rest when weary
And entrance gained to that strong-hold .
Open the books , for the judgment is set :
Earth shuddered at my crown of blasphemy ,
Even from its verge ; the mysteries opened there
These gaping wounds withhold us from the fight . "
In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes :
While round us , kindling into love ,
Soft human tongues that break the deepening hush
That give assurance of their own success ,
Lost in love 's great unity . "
The unthinking ploughman started and gave ear .
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here ! --
Give thee a better province than thy thought .
With bramble-roses ; and where autumn fills
Far as the day-spring shoots herself abroad ,
Bubbling runnels join 'd the sound ;
The drifting surf , the wintry year ,
It feels the fire of an immortal spark ,
That bore the shield and couched the lance
Which he kept for battle and days of need ;
Till not a woe the bleak world see ,
Water is taught by thirst ;
That frank , that open-hearted life which keeps
Her toil-spent hands and sinks into repose ;
As rocks resist the billows and the sky .
And learn they were not made to live alone !
For things to come her eye can see ,
Where none doo fishes take ;
Past doubt her wisdom , taking from mad war
Or a music that solemnly moves along --
Leaped from the couch and rushed upon her fate ;
Tremblingly followed the soft strain ,
His face directed , and large passage made .
Or her faults to me made known ,
From thy faith in justice flowing ;
And trace the river 's winding shore .
It made those guilty men grow pale with fear .
Since through the warrior half his weapon went .
" who in years that this shall follow ,
The sacrificer 's axe will serve thy turn .
Burdens that grew almost too great to bear ,
Fall and with dying shrieks roll on the earth ,
Till other 's tongue reveal them . fervent love
All cymri set its last undaunted hope ;
Did take his way in solitary guise :
Spring and daisies came apace ;
And its horrid smell released .
They call to mind the yell that woke
For its colors stay .
She raised her eyes in mournful mood -
To meet that baby 's look
The breast that feels thy purest flames divine ,
So i threw over that rich attorney 's
That tempts on desperate wing the soul to rise
Rise up to take delight in lute-playing ,
't was an honest race he run .
For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms ,
The nations shall take note . his unripe age
As the years went grinding by ,
For it holds the sea and land ;
Or sorrow will bring ,
Each friend , with kindly words addressed ,
Light feet , white feet , meet them merrily .
Of his great father . admiration seized
Yet i would spare thy pain the least renewal ,
The sigh that 's breathed for one to hear --
But soon those cheeks will lose their red ,
Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow .
Too long the world has smiled to hear
Tracking the lion to his dreary home .
Waste and consume the beauty of thy youth .
Flaps cawless , wrapped in hungry woe .
We owe it to you that our banner ,
What is there left to fear ?
To him who sees time spin the years around .
The crowd was prostrate ; still , i felt
With lighter probe or deep , touching the faith ,
Lost in his own horrific contemplations ,
And which includes not mercy . i would have
Tremendous thunders join 'd the hurricane ,
Or framed your thoughts in a well measured line ;
He warbles melody .
He felt his way along the mossy root
She buried its flame deep in the white sands ,
When next their wedding-day came round ,
The forest to the cave withdrew ,
It tells the conqueror
Could lose her image ; -- firm and bright ,
Thence southward turned its rapid road
Came the spring with all its splendor ,
That kisseth everything it meets :
The servant , who hath joyful tidings brought ,
And for to make the merry cheer ,
And ran to chase my fright .
And by all means for his deliverance meet ,
Began to cast lascivious eyes ; she him
The mountains belched forth fire on fated cities .
To scatter loving smiles and words of cheer
No sacrifice will he repent when made !
With eyes that tabernacled tears --
Though the poor gift betray my poverty ,
Mark , where ambition leads the adverse band ,
The sun-gleams came down from the heavens
And ere thou for my joy was given ,
Which from the earth rises into the breezes
The crown of england drawn from trouble sore ;
And found where idle sorrow lay
Has shown her how weak is the chieftain ,
No respite to himself from cares he gives ,
Pitifully blowing out his life 's little rushlight ,
It points the lover 's fearless brand ;
This plunder fell to menelaus ' share ,
He trusted to the sea to gain his wealth ,
Courage , if sorrow come , to bear it ,
Where flourish arrogance and pride ,
Once , when the year stood still at june ,
And sets my heart on fire .
The hour will come ( which let not me
In vain his nostrils clouds of smoke respire ,
But paid attention to the dough .
I do not count the hours i spend
Or two substances that their affinities found .
And welcome came or went at will .
The deaf made answer with their sneers !
But sorrow a step he changed , and his prayer
Still it told us there was fear ,
New beauty like flowers that are sweetest when shaken .
Until we reached god 's promised land .
Superfluous matter came , shot out in ears
This weary heart has grown
The hair lies smooth and bright and fine ,
By folly urged to senseless crime ,
As long as the sunflower sought the sun , --
To show how lightly life may glide away ;
The years came , and the years went ,
By shadows where murmurings kissed ;
There where the sinner leaves off sinning ,
Where the red sun sinks in the opal sea ,
't is not the frost that freezes fell ,
To think how her beauty is gone to decay .
Success is bitter when it is slow in coming .
The joy that in her radiance leapt
To lead the life of a fool ,
And true rehearsal made she of his deeds ,
Love of the father spreads to all the race .
And it was coupled with a sneer ;
Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen ,
Yet more she feared the daylight bringing nigh
Purest of motives , duty leads thy heart :
Three times round has the sun gone , jean ,
And of the woe my life should leave . ”
But the dire secret of my fate reveal .
Confiding in our want of worth , he stands ;
His arms flash sunshine back ; the azure fold
That swifter than the tempest flew .
Which love put on her , fortune too pursued ,
Like torrents when they downward dash ,
Farther on the little band went ,
This heart he can not find in heaven above ;
He formed a wily , plausive tale ,
Gathering strength for efforts yet to come .
The mermaid wave that would go out to sea ,
Stealing their sweetness from a heaven of love ,
And the sight of thine eyes shall be made
When eyes are blinded with sad tides of tears ,
To what the eternal evening brings .
That called a weary nation to ungird ,
With banners of mist that still waver above them ,
Then comes the tulip race , where beauty plays
Across sad leagues that sink and rise
The present is subtly welded into the past ,
And stealthily the twilight shadows creep .
Come wealth or want , come good or ill ,
The catching fire might burn the golden caul .
The smooth sea runs apace --
A _ moral _ roasting would have got .
Lord , set thy churches free
Butterfly wings came drifting , dreaming ,
The ladies sighed how fast the time had flown ;
Alas ! the storm hath rolled
Bringing the soul of great sebastian near :
Thy haughty heart thou wouldst not bend ,
And conscience gives no puncture for its pain .
Who grasps at shadows risks the bone .
Whiter as it climbs to god !
Within her heart there lurked a trembling prayer
And where giants ' carcants flare and sit ,
Yon rising moon that leads us home again ,
Then stillness , while a little cloud went drift .
Triumphal with triumphal act have met ,
To let the punishment fit the crime --
High state , the bed is where misfortune lies ,
To their conceipt , that others never see !
By that oath we made above !
Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life ,
A crime , her victor 's clemency withstood :
Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe .
Now saw the light and made it terrible .
On the whole felt a strong disposition to cheer .
New volumes came across the sea
And then a gentle breeze danced overhead ,
His glowing axle doth allay . "
" and all things work together for the good
What that name might imply ;
Then tears of anger from his eyelids fell ,
That shall echo forth the praises
Of heaven appear 'd to open for my flight ,
Next , marmion marked the celtic race ,
She went for water , as she had need ,
Which shaped its subtle curves , and ever must
One sire had met the sword ,
Ere even a shadow of night gave warning
Glory of youth glowed in his soul :
Of beauty that 's born for an hour ?
Who fears his sire ’s command to break . ”
Aloft he whirls , to crush the savage prey !
And in words like these expressed him :
The story knows not , or that praiseless king
Where truth in awful mystery resides .
That moves the mind to reason and aspire ;
In triumph issuing forth thir glorious chief ;
Who watched this fence till the seeds took root ?
And smoke of incense whirled about this portrait ,
Of that companion-thought . alone i plough
Would strive the burthen to maintain .
Love 's long lost golden rays ,
The unexpected noose , leaps here and there ,
To make a third at your tryst :
Save of a corpse , that silently they bear ,
For the bold task his soul has dared .
And take her walking in the darkness -- where ?
The storm the dark lycaean groves displayed ,
The islands feel the enclasping flow ,
And we departing left them to that broil .
That gives a man wings ,
The love that sought to brighten up the gloom ,
When asia rose from bathing ;
The friar saw the conflict from a knoll ,
And the old miracle in record told
That found the taproom of the mermaid warm
The words that dropped from his sweet tongue
Black with the strife that made it free
And the barley sprouted bravely ,
Through sorrows deep her path has led ,
There lies thy path : but ere thou go ,
Down comes the winter rain -
The victor 's loss who made the rough ascent .
" to bend in worship , lucifer was right !
A forlorn round of rocky contours made ,
No bird-song floated down the hill ,
Their binding net around us cast .
His onward course the hero held ,
Could measure its full horror ; the great jaws
Inexorable hatred thou maintain ' st :
To slack these flames wherein i fry ?
To till the old world 's wisdom till it grow
In one another , and had gone to sleep
Peace in a thousand fields of waving grain ,
You lose yourself , but find your self indeed ;
Where men put service upon her ,
To thy star that my soul hath seen .
A saving knowledge of the way of truth ,
Just to reach the dreaming
Great heart that sprang to duty 's call ;
The glorious saint his answer made
The leaping topsail thundered like a drum .
Dead mary , thy accusing spirit stand !
Then let me pass the night in tears ,
All time was gathered , and her panting chest
Awhile , though but a pensive ear ye lend ,
Still holds the freshness of thy grace ;
But as in silver trumpet nought is found
Anticipative of the feast to come ;
And freedom 's tide comes up alway
To make your heartes gaye and light ;
There where the lamp of cupid gave the light :
And filled with dew and gladness ,
Shall stretch his reign , that spans the earth .
We 'll go to meet the dawning ,
Their cries engulfed him like the night ,
Glory sought is honour lost ,
The barn of my childhood stands !
The trees stood straight against a paling sky ,
For many a year . his respite gave him time
And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade :
Death only takes a single pig --
Reveal god 's purpose , and secure
At last we find ourselves defeated .
Ye 'll get the best o ' moral works ,
Though mountains lay between .
Th ' exulting bird distinguish 'd triumph brings ,
The babe found sweet repose ;
Each wave springs upward , climbing toward the fair
To lose its life as it reaches the ground .
Where pallid ghosts dim-gleaming go .
And flushed with hope they grasp each rope ,
So long ago the cause was lost
Nor seek to shatter any plan that he might
Something were changed disaster would come to the nation .
To see that virtue should despised be
And then come fifty , and fifty-five .
When to the nearest verge of land we drew ,
Who danger and the dead had faced ,
And how his color came ,
True discipline met not with long neglect .
The wordless sorrow comfort in them sees ,
A sigh the goddess gave , and with a frown
The church has lost enough , god knows ,
Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin
He knows , who gave that love sublime , --
What manner of death should make their anguish loud ,
A week in quod has ruined lots of chaps
The doubts ye now can see .
There comes a smile acutely sweet
High in the dome a dire assembly sat ,
Could these into a thread be drawn by art ,
Memories of her that fragrance brought . forlorn
Then let thy virtue match the crime ,
And trained to labor , the gray rock mused :
Comes reverence , her features
And sorrow 's faded form , and solitude behind .
Stretching across the miles that sever you from me .
The young warm passion nursed no thought of shame ;
Some creed of which its prophets cry it holds
" beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root .
To kill , and generals turn it into jest .
Look thou my steps pursue : the margins give
And from us his noble form hath passed
And here was thrust upon me something devilish :
Dawn has flashed up the startled skies ,
The tread of sandalled feet comes noiselessly .
Bring back the friendship of the sun ;
Seems sent from earth to kiss the sky .
When aching arms reached out in fruitless quest ,
Was resting in serene beauty ,
The pulse and desires of mine heart shall arrest ,
Who finds himself , loses his misery ! "
No sin-stain had found you ,
Himself to sing , and build the lofty rhyme .
That , overcome my power , i turned my back
No stain from its breath is spread
And it tells the bird in a single word ,
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
The thread of life is spun :
He sees why nature plants in man alone
A lover ever poured through lips of mine .
Lilies with roses to combine their splendour .
Nor feel it shattered by the blow .
The preacher went and took his text : --
The quiet clouds lean down and rest .
A call of gold is floated from her ear !
Wherewith death 's shore is bound ,
The woman 's touch runs through our magazines ;
Was fixed upon the glowing sky ,
The voice that filled those halls with melody
They issued forth from underneath the deep
Of all that human art hath made
To wash away the bloody stains of war :
The bliss of being sad made melancholy .
Enraptured ; low she laughs , his woes disperse ;
" we feel very tired , " they said .
Thickening fog rolls up , and chokes
Of certain death where duty lay .
Marvelous darkness shadow 'd o'er the place .
Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist
Marphisa would not such a course pursue :
For the spirit had flown away .
My frame was shatter 'd , i betook myself
If truth and goodness have not been lost .
But out of these one shall not gather love .
The neck that made that white robe wan ,
To that silent isle , which lies
But what stern war announces . much the change ,
Deep the grief that settled o'er him ,
But from each side great succor now was brought
Probably to this group belong also the following poets :
Wakening the echoes of joy long fled !
No scathe from strife that man may make ?
While back to its kindred it flies to unfold
And your luck that has held its own ;
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave .
The midnight hour is sped ,
No pitying throe thy bosom gave ;
One finds that the average citizen
Thy word has told me
Philistia trembled as it whizz 'd along :
With such fell cruelty were seen , their goads
All my life long my language shall declare . "
Hope till the morrow brings the light ;
I will permit my memory to recall
How in this presence should his tears not come ,
But kept the vows that held him bound :
Truth must be sought with the positivists .
And though self-love would coldly say
So long as the hangman makes us dread ,
He drank until the flittering eyelids screened .
Since i gave him that first kiss ;
Alone can save you from eternal stings .
Who were her heirs , no record shows ;
The autumn wind goes sighing
Youth and love take playtime , playtime ...
Who kept the sacred laws , who swerved no step
And , balancing that with this ,
And every stream ran blood ;
His large obeisance puts to shame
This couplet follows in the ms. :
Only the echoes , which he made relent ,
Comes the mighty breath of love .
And set afloat the remnant of his loins ,
Has gone from me and left my bosom cold .
But bread secured by patient toil --
With lusty arms he cleaves the waves ,
What misery have i brought upon my head ! -
I leave this light ,
It stands alone and somberly
Where once had stood a happy home , and there
The hurricane , at thy command goes forth ,
Of labour that no gain can breed .
I found a road that ran through cloud
And dips the gloomy waters as they run ,
Just opening in their early birth ,
The calendar stands for a stone above .
Soon hurries me back to despair .
Love lay waking in my heart .
Her speech new fury to their hearts convey ’d ;
Might blush to hear it and feel half offended .
No triumph shall attend the dame
He said ; and with such forceful prayer appealed ;
Farewell , fair day , so foully spent !
Again his glorious seat sublime he took .
Tears stand upon the lashes of thine eyes ,
And when sweet mercy 's name he bore ?
And the best of foals have harnessed . "
Ideals , its emotions live among ;
Sent from my soul to pomona had gained
But from this object sinking back amazed ,
Nor pleasure only gave the finish 'd robe ,
And high in air the liquid mountain rose ;
And from the stern gives signal . we obey ,
Gives him warmth , and food , and shelter ,
While darkness quickly gathered overhead ,
From it she raised such flame and smoke
And no rain falls and no waters run .
Sparkling , flashing in the sunshine ;
In the hours that remain ere we part .
And out we 'll sail where the treasures lie .
Rich gems around them as they go ,
Our hearts now walk a secret round
There rose a noise of striking clocks ,
O'er all the man conflicting passions rise ;
May it turn happier than my doubts portend !
Albeit those purple grapes hang high ,
The groaning trees untimely shed their locks ,
Within his arms and gives him what for love
To cleave the rift of difference deeper yet ;
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers ;
I shot a hawk perched on the top
He keeps his eye on her .
Take on velocity anew , anew ,
His pulses sway . is she not passing fair ?
Close shall i hold my memories and my madness ,
As his wife the spirit holds me ;
Our hearts went with him . back we swept ,
But he had felt that in life 's dance ,
But it strove often for to sink ,
The rites of mourners render , but in vain .
All six at anchor on the crawling tide !
Hast thou found a joy completer ,
Hermes the prophet , twining in one power
( the easy mark was stuffed for fair . )
And with the forward ones his arms it seized ;
And this same flower that smiles to-day ,
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds .
And catch the burning sparks that fly
Of lands historic ; turning dusty pages ,
So cruel to bear ,
There is a memory stays upon old ships ,
Of belial , flown with insolence and wine .
They ring my bells of victory ,
Which do support the feeble life that else
To-morrow brings more dangerous toil ,
It speaks a tale of other years --
Those other conflicts placed himself , that where
But longer in that paradise to dwell ,
Half hid the centuries ' decay .
Strong in a fate set free ,
That color every drop they hold ,
Onward the pageant swept , and as it passed ,
Such light as never heaven let through
Since the waves rolled over the old gray town ,
This with angry murmurs the men of gunther bore .
The windows and the dials gazed ,
Sore did he cumber our retreat ,
And i first got a pledge of promised grace :
Fit for the young affections to come out
That shines like a star on life 's wave ,
A music entered , making passion fain :
That bears the form of a hunted deer ,
That sends you into slumber when you read .
Ye mariners , the night is gone . "
The direful penalties his oath hath laid
And gave , all glowing warm , to thine .
And scorned those idle blows they struck in vain ;
And gave good offerings that remove
All my heart is buried with you ,
For something happier still to come .
The adjustment , and meanwhile , inspires the strife
And chastity the name she bore .
So many good people find fault with god ,
Comes the honey of all sweet ,
In time to gather an enchantment thence .
Then the dripping clouds divided ,
How slowly go the lonesome hours !
But thereon every god stood up
That makes me fear . when you were telling how
Yet virtue in the paths marked out by fate
Mourn the keep-sake thou hast broken ?
Two tedious days and two long nights we lay ,
Here lawrence rests , his country 's pride ,
Spring wraps its transient scarf of green ,
And priest for marmion breathed the prayer ,
He gave a groan , it was his last ,
Here let the sunshine softly fall ,
Faster than the hunter 's eye could follow ,
And kindle anew the senses almost gone .
And trees and houses hang in air .
Work as a seaman , and be kept or cast
What can match a lover 's speed ?
The mighty shadow is borne along ,
That sat upon his victim 's downcast brow ,
Where time , by circling bliss we measure ,
The stone , the canvas , animated , stand .
Earth feels the grateful influence from above ,
Congenial hearts shall greet with kindred love ,
Nor can i miss the way , so strongly drawn
And like a memory 's vague recovered trace
Then nuzzle round and make your final sweep ,
At his behest who gave my sire command ,
I lay no claim on priesthood , but have told
His heart be stirred with any foolish heat
He felt his foe was foolish to dispute .
Of eve , whose eye darted contagious fire .
I 've heard you oft eternal truth declare ;
Its black wings spread , shall up to heaven ascend
White birches danced in frills of green ,
_ so wide thereof the story goes _ .
Where shadows spoil the beam ,
They saw where , urged with fury , far
Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
These riches therefore here securely lay ,
To him the dame had given the chalice dread ,
Which from the sun receives a sparkling light ,
But whoso takes his cross , and follows christ
Where lie the dead lips that thirst to kiss ,
" ethereal limbed the lovely sleep should sit ,
The news that pity would not break ,
Time swiftly flies , while each enjoys the walk .
When love or honor 's weighed with death .
Shall bear your song eternally .
Which for their son these parents made ,
I thought that grief might gar her quit ,
The rainbows , give us air and cloudless skies .
Didst make thy triumph over death and sin ,
Fled sudden , as the night had fled :
Sweet day , whose beauty never fades in night ;
The flames that burn within the heart , the kisses
Let fortune lay on me her worst disgrace ;
And mortal vows take on immortal worth ,
Are already admitted . oh mabel , my wife ,
My tingling ear is filled with still repose ;
The snow fell hissing in the brine ,
Was it last summer , or ages gone ,
Followed his bow . but often she would sit ,
What act like his of days gone by --
And left him alone with his shame and sin .
Is almost choked by unresisted lust .
A lone palm leans in the moonlight
Or all enjoying , what contentment find ?
The grace that turns life 's water into wine .
Which brought the distance near , he thought it out
" never , never , comes tear or sorrow ,
And such joys as these she 'll bring :
The light in which was smiling my own treasure
By toil and famine worn to skin and bone ,
Whence is my line and lineage traced ?
It was that answered me , the voice of guile
With ample walls that all mankind might hold ,
So vague and varied , come
Its worldly striving , its greed for gold ,
That the lost scholar long was seen to stray ,
And find the lonely harvest of the night
Tho ' it should serve nae ither end
All which some examples more clearly will show .
And wealth has filled his halls with mirth ,
And from the charming rigour thy muse brings
Death strikes the hero to the dust . he falls
Since that would give me freedom from the thought
With error in ambition justly charged ,
The fire is whispering , " marjorie mine ,
Warm butterflies float in the sun ,
I trace the lives such scenes enshrine ,
Round me the thunders of battle are roaring ;
The grief that can get leave to run
Grief , with a glass that ran ;
And through the football rumbled .
Till the last heart 's drop fills mine eyes .
Broken and stained by disgrace ?
I took her dainty eyes , as well
And so the seasons kept their round ;
And golden autumn passes by .
And draws the spirit most unto itself ,
Then naught is left but memory .
And within it came a people
A rustic bier of sturdy branches spread .
Thou sever not ; trial will come unsought .
And kind attention paid to these
Mists roll away ,
" my love is laid on you ,
My words were waiting for a calm . her sobs
Vain is it that your science sweeps the skies ,
Though hope were mixed with fear ,
And cool air gathered with a trembling fan ,
In vain our pitying tears are shed ,
Where have they borne my love away ? "
Them quick resentment stung , but him the most ,
Upheld by truth the monarch reigns ,
Break the magic of the tale
Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades .
Like vases that hold no flowers ;
Their sofa occupied three parts complete
And through these sweet fields go ,
Down went the royal george
With her eyes cast down she passed by
Stem we the rolling surge of chance !
The _ obligations _ on thee laid ,
Lost the prize that paris gave ;
A suppliant , refuge seeks with me .
For in my grief god 's care is shown ,
Goaded by jealous rage , the laurels tore ,
Still hamish hung heavy with fear for to go
Yet ship by ship steals through the mists
And little birds break out in rippling song !
That constance held affection to the veil ;
Suns may shine , or the rains beat chill ,
Religion lay the way she went ;
Each evil one came --
Hunger that craves immortal bread and wine .
No fretful whims appear 'd to tease ;
As brandished at the eyes of ignorance .
" roses in the spring i gather ! "
The gray twilight shades come attended with gloom ,
Following the guiding hope of life ,
Imperious prudence took with sparing thirst .
Into ixion 's wheel to turn all heaven .
Nowhere appeared the art which all this wrought .
Which made the people laugh .
He gave , and roland received , the bow .
The sketch rests on the easel ,
Where the living water runs ! --
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes .
And music trembled through its happy rooms .
The world thus is filled with confusion and strife ,
I placed my trust in rank and fame ,
Then untamo , thus made answer ,
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave .
Little of mortal life remained to me ,
What geologic periods hast thou seen ,
Think what a life of woe is left
Where hearts like thine have broke or bled ,
Desires to bring that duel to an end .
To find what sense or reason might apply : --
But serve him well , the honor of the field
Remember days of bliss gone by ?
Now unto her all due obedience swore ,
Can wisdom be put in a silver rod ?
Nine years kept secret in the dark abode ,
His heart seemed bursting with delight .
Upon her cheeks her former beauties spread ;
An hour of sweet release will come ,
_ the dust of forty centuries has buried babylon ,
No bustling trader showed his wares .
" thus the information reached me ,
These realms that lay the nearest to her heart ,
Pure as the white stars sweeping through the sky ,
But snow-whorls which the wind shall roll
His seat was filled by some no better clerk ,
Joyous the carol that rings in the mountains ,
Till it grows joy to you .
While his darts lay nations low .
Once gave wild sweetness to , as to a tune
In borrowed glory , -- spreading flame ,
" england shall find that every man
Moon-beams play upon the scene ,
We launch a bark to plough the watery plains ,
Shadows of things and veils of ages riven
For our day is dead and has left no traces
I felt that the immortal tide
Which heaven planted us to please ,
While yet the expected tempest hangs on high ,
A little ghost , whose steps have passed
With the eye 's spirit running forth to meet
Intenser feeling and expanded thought ;
Founded on truth it will forever shine ,
He added also . last , twelve gallant sons
And faith becomes a knowledge fixed , eternal ,
The redbreast warbles shrilly once and stops ;
Thus cycles vast will find our names combined . "
Dead seasons quicken in one petal-spot
With thee grones , terrors , furies dwell ;
There came the shuddering that the twilight sends .
The shrieking fires that struck the sunlight pale ,
Blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend
And to his parliament the matter sends .
May fortune on thy labours smile .
And dauntless courage lead to leap the fold ,
Hills , that almost seem to drop ,
That makes the world we mortal beings tread ,
But never a favor you bestow .
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread ,
Of paris , choked with slaughter ! europe flamed
And the next day he made good his word .
Small thanks they gave to you .
A home where heart and soul may rest .
Gleaming lilies bathed in moonlight .
That bears the cross of war .
If chance so takes them , it is plain
Felt harold 's loss amid the host 's dismay
( warily young rogero answer made , )
They drew the sunset-clouds into their bosom
To call a sort of eastern parliament
Unearthly melodies were born to make
Nor give thee any love -- which were unjust .
Still the mighty wonder came ,
Many have weeks and months together spent .
This fashion that our fathers gave
And let him feel that mercy now
As promachus his slaughtered brother draws ,
Your hours pass with laughter and song , dear ,
Wet hills , hung heavily with woods ,
The cord with mighty force he drew .
And knowledge , god , his mind went reeling back
No tears should stay my flight above ,
Out of the book that chronicles the past .
And torch brightly flaring ,
May innocence for ever lead me here ,
My shepherd 's cloak will serve me for disguise .
Preluded those melodious bursts that fill
Rest a little , then set to sea ;
And thereto bind myself by oath and word :
Bright shines the flag of day
In the garden of our love , summer still goes
That in its depths may lie .
Upward from chin to nose my finger laid .
Low lids that cling to the last of love :
To stir our hearts in spring !
With an eye always lifted toward the west
What though no sacred earth allow thee room ,
Our intellect is to such depth absorb 'd ,
Shut in her heart , a blossom closely curled .
Strength to bear it will be given ,
And worthy thou their might to sway . ”
Before in their fury they fell upon him ,
The fever held him -- the captain said ,
To meet lifes daily toil aright ,
With only her tears to guard her .
Nor fields of flying italy to chase :
Then said i , " what is there to bound
' so many herds are put in each division .
And his glorious memories only remain :
This humble offering made by truth to love ,
And bring the scenes of opening fate to light .
Ask god who knows . for frequent tears have run
And bore to see the sight of pain that yet
That ebb left naked to the stars .
The gladness of the earth is shown .
Which makes hot pulses beat ,
The cow jumped over the moon ,
Vain tampering has but fostered his disease ,
And chastened limbs ride round athena 's shrine
Exposed to hazard of so far sought war ,
Some twine about her thigh to make her stay :
An altar in the midst , and laid
I crush each moment , with its sweets to stay
Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung .
And the sun hung like a red balloon ,
" united you must stand ,
Every morn is the world made new ;
Like harmless thunders , breaking at his feet ,
To what oracle turns with attention each head ?
Nor fate his calm and humble hopes beguiled ;
Heaven 's clouds like radiant islands float ,
Swift , by the maiden 's charms subdued ,
Until the issue come . will it disclose
I follow but my star :
Thus love will nevermore grow old ,
And fix thy brave blue english eyes on mine ,
He sought the opposing powers to blend .
No motion felt in the dark ,
With chanted word your voice lets loose your soul ,
Swift follow 'd by avenging , smiting brands ,
And the beautiful things it learns before its birth ,
Where the vision led ,
Whence like a bee it found its cell ,
To hire hath alle his scales lent ,
Read o'er thyself , thy talents scan ,
For i go some words to seek for ,
And his soul leans out to the sweet wild snatches
What peace they find who there fall fast asleep ,
Time will make her prove more kind ,
She gave to flow her maiden vest ;
Thou hast shattered into ruin ,
Of the great shield , wherein the lion lies
Quick with words that rush to find them .
And the sorrow that hides in a smile -
Of one another , so to sink ; but learn
We share the liberty
For on his soul a heavenly hope had dawned .
Some vanished raptures that you miss or lack ?
And purple even sweetly lead me on
From which the virgin 's blood alone can save ;
The lone and level sands stretch far away ; "
And now she gives a cry of fear ,
Alas ! if following the tumultuous flight
Time looks on pomp with vengeful mood
Lost in a desert of unconsciousness ,
Full closely to the fire she drew ;
The rose said to the grave .
To raise this fainting prayer :
Wrong , followed by a deeper wrong !
The oak leviathans , whose huge ribs make
To guard and keep the one true faith
For the april rain has wept over them ,
Come wind , come weather :
But still he fluttered pulses when he said ,
Sending forth murmurs as it flew .
I fell in love with nan ,
But truth severe shall dictate to my tongue :
Will o'er you his protecting hand extend ? "
Gladly i gave to speed the dardan 's flight .
Where shadows pass that have no sight ,
Till this stormy night be gone ,
Tears shed ,
Then nature bids . survey such when they write ,
And surly winter grimly flies ;
Through rocks and caves the name of delia sounds ,
Their ranks had passed , epytides afar
Who for fresh nuptials joyfully yield all else ?
But noble things remain ,
And there made known their tale of fear ,
Fair came the falling wind ; a seaman said
And whatever led hither those proud steps of thine ,
Stretched into longitude ; which having passed ,
Up to the moon is cast --
Like little birds that followed on swift wings ,
One trembling sound to break the depth of silence .
He like a father shares the joy .
And where the wild waves beat ,
Sang a song filled with tears and wailing ,
And the curse i take for my own ,
But though discretion oft had fail 'd him ,
And little shadows come about her eyes ;
Here i am in his favor found ,
Say at what age a poet grows divine ?
And left me the life that is hard .
Receive and take a newe feith ,
I can not bring myself to drop the quill ,
She pat but little faith in :
The antique prow goes on its way , dividing
From whence your breath you drew ,
Bind the sweet feet of mercy : poverty
Proud though in desolation -- which could find
To the doom that death will bring .
From revelation 's path , what tricks she plays ;
Sway men from sinful ways
A breath , a touch like this hath shaken .
And breathed the stifling atmosphere of streets ,
And cuff in freedom , went his way .
Never to living ear came sweeter sounds
Still , the hovering voice unshed ,
And springs ran nectar , honey dropped from trees .
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
Discovery of a visit made by stealth .
That lifts to song your meanest knight ,
Christmas comes but once a year .
As soon as sleep his brow came o’er ,
How she came stealing to the wayward boy ;
Age that can find red roses sweet ,
And hid by night the fair spring blossoms lie .
So 's he could make an honest cent .
And it filled both mist and dream with pain ,
Was turned now to dismall heavinesse ,
And the dogwood blossoms hang over you .
With his debut , which made a strong impression ,
Till swayed by smiles from thee !
Might yet have spared these mouldering walls ,
Short the journey that is left thee ,
I stand . the waves beneath me run
It stayed as black as night ;
And storms like furies pass remorseless by .
And early hath he gone to his reward .
And found his whole good-breeding scarce enough .
And there we 'll take our pleasure .
His purposes will ripen fast ,
But we left him alone with his glory .
An odorous mist had stolen up the hill ,
For talents mourn , untimely lost ,
My troubled soul hath found repose ,
While friends he 'd known long since had grown
With equal force of lungs their titles try :
To pour the odyssey out .
That tumbled death upon him like a stone ;
Worth being rich to hold in fee .
I was n't built to play no lofty part .
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
Still run on poets in a raging vein ,
Cold tears must fall upon the lonely field ,
With all the roses summer never brings .
Although we missed the summer-time .
Had from the altar led an able wife .
Midst which they found that they indeed must die ;
In rainbow colours that dazzle and wane
The plague destroying whom the sword would spare ,
And fill thy leisure with an earnest prayer
And found no light ,
But death , who feeds on tears and woe ,
And shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds .
She warbled handel ; it was grand --
That on his crupper sank each staggering horse :
Forth : all about them swept the giant waves ,
Three summer days to take , --
The creeping gloom that settled into night :
Touch the crude line with fear ,
Shall feel your ruling passion strong in death :
Where once the light foot went .
Slowly across the chequer 'd shadows pass .
Hangs like a pall of death above the soul ,
Where glozing parasites hold sway ,
Smiled into life where they were set .
That tell too well the thoughts that hidden lie .
A gilded hook that holds a poison 'd bait .
And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds :
The battle and my hopes are lost ,
And i , who have been lying in this pain
Reflex , his ineffectual weapon stay 'd .
A pretty babe all burning bright
In one full tide through all my senses flowing !
( i wonder who gave it that name ? )
Each glance that on their forms he threw
Forget the heavens from which they fall .
And oh , we feel thy presence here ,
That iron tongue , made to speak sentences
His long hair makes on the earth its track ;
And with his gaze fixed on the symbol said :
Sweet stillness reigned ; and there the angel found
With foes such treaty never should be kept ,
Thus on each part the sinners stood , but soon
Incensed for pristine evil wrought on him .
And lent him fancied charms !
But when dull speakers strive to move compassion ,
To bring back comfort thence unto that faith ,
Oh , bring beauty , bring roses ,
Shall quite extinguish , and the chilly air
Which some pretend to trace in ladies ' smiles .
Whose helpless nostrils drink the bitter sea ;
Which warns the touch , while winning the sense ,
These wounds of life in no mean part are kept
( an ' providence ca n't beat the devil )
To give thy utter weariness a rest ?
In peace below the gentle waters run ;
Not proof enough such object to sustain ,
Whose ready heart brought flame for flame ,
To follow their slain monarch 's hearse this night ,
Things that steam can stamp and fold ;
Wealth sought and kings adventured life to hold .
Of coming eloquence , as firm it stood ,
The spears that knew the way to victory -
And hooded ; and her hand which held the hood
The form of freedom will alone remain --
I know he waved to life ,
How she had freed that passage from the foe ,
Even so you fluttered , followed , floated ,
A heart that stirs , is hard to bind ;
And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
Nay , by and by comes another spring ;
If any power assist achilles ’ hand .
That calls the wretched gay to dark delights .
Yet this were to give unto god the eye --
The laughing flowers , that round them blow ,
And the succeeding age shall see them join
And summons all his strength to meet the charge .
God put the wondrous volume by .
Unearthly was the hymn , which then arose .
And spring has given love a flower to hold ,
No subject there we find for joyous strains .
Both light and shadow with repose were filled ,
My eyes have told my love , maud ,
And chestnuts fall from satin burrs
Young liberty gave her libations to flow ,
While countless generations pass away .
And every flower that sad embroidery wears :
Sending forth piteous shrieks and fearful cries .
Where breeze and pilot drive us through the deep .
Sweet milk that smacked of mountain thyme ,
The frail white stars moved slowly over the sky .
To trial bring her stolen charms ,
By magic and directed by the fiend .
While solace rich came in thy train .
Have swept the woods and dimmed the plain .
Is emptied more and made a void , forthwith
A trembling fills each dark vault there ,
Breaking the light , revealed that sevenfold arch
My courage prompting me amain toward
That over the valley hung ,
With the people filled with witchcraft . "
The tears that follow fast ;
His chords were playing .
To bring good luck to all creatures known ;
While he softened o'er his outlined angel ,
That laps and laves his body bold
His frothy slaver , venom 'd bites ;
It lifts fu ' mony fortune ' boon ,
With shrieks strangled by wind and wave and terror .
Gives added fragrance to the summer flowers ,
The grief away that stops his answer so :
Who money has , on him is favor poured ;
Which passes through the veins itself to make them .
That fear of taking cold was past
And hours passed in dreaming
It nestled in my dreaming eyes
That smile ! it never came of being gay .
That loved the light of song to pour ;
The rifted rays they gathered , and immersed
Of linked sweetness long drawn out ,
" and at last when death draws near you ,
Grief that a song is stilled ,
Then came the evening ’s twilight shade ,
Than beauty here on earth has given ;
Or lured by thornless crowns of fame ;
That gives and takes a long warm kiss
Faintest odours around them straying ,
So flourish and wave in the mind of man
And thus with gentle words addressed :
In bitter bitter woe will pass :
Joy sprang into my heart .
In him found shelter from the street .
With what they bring of joy and bliss --
What friend to put trust in ,
A couplet is added in the ms. :
That tyranny is slain , --
And recall our songs and legends ,
" or leave a kiss within the cup
To go seeking sorrow .
Or if thy fields must run with roman blood
The peace that lay , the light that shone .
Hypocrisy , flattery , and who deals in magic ,
Surges the heat of lovers to and fro ,
And sorrow many they did feel .
Cheer follows cheer through all the elfin ranks ;
Of all white things dreamed and vowed .
A nation proudly keeps his deathless fame ;
The atoms , as their own weight bears them down
Find beauty in their bells of every hue .
Fearless he was , and scorning all disguise .
The cruel frost encrusts the cornland !
Short respite ; it is all that war allows .
A little unto laughter moved my lips ;
The secret with unearthly shrieks confessed ,
Like the bow that guards the tartar :
Kind , simple souls that stab and slash and slay
Away from us the moaning flame did glide
Youth and love take playtime , playtime ...
There passed a thin cold blade with sudden smart
Through deathless voices answer to my strings ,
Springtime , alas ! has no balm to impart .
No more this supplication urged by me .
The soul , are laid beneath that spell ;
But he wished a flame and made it ,
Each christian nation shall take upon her
For faint his dying love , yet coldly stirred
The flame of love will yet be growing .
And from his fatal courage finds his bane .
Is gone wherever it goes -- for good ,
And the old crow shook with laughter .
And told the hope thy soul has nursed ,
Sending forth murmurs as it flew .
The little stars beat time .
That it made the devil start and stare .
Growing into a nation , and now grown
Kindness to any one to show .
Which passes through the veins itself to make them .
That comes to warm you with its ray ,
The waters have ceased but they run for ever .
Gloomy and narrow , lies the little town ,
Upon her cheek the red rose dawned , --
Or lost in the love it gave .
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
High in air the clouds then follow !
The white lake-blossom fell into the lake
Can hold a winking light o ' love
He runs to find his errant wealth again !
Commerce extends as far as waves can roll ,
Her eyes already have sped the shades that flee ,
Hermes , for cunning subtleties unmatch 'd ;
Are bound in slavery 's fetters still :
A bright rose stirred .
And lit her face with exquisite swift fire
Remotely , plays on the misdeeming sense ,
One love with golden pinions caught .
And give his vows a blissful end . ”
Battle-cries -- the drums are beating .
With burning rage , and thus exclaimed :
I see thine hooded shadow glide along .
To find the arms of my true love
That chastity shall take no harme .
In setting forth an armado
The ground-pine curled its pretty wreath ,
He only feels the freshened air ,
Yet saw him wipe out slavery 's blot ;
Beneath her thought climbed upward , to the bound
Follow still my soul ,
The bridal vestments waited to array ,
To claim a portion of their solitude .
How many heads thy mighty plans pursue ;
Their urgent billows pour ;
And weakly yield to passion ’s sway ?
From tears that bring no healing ,
The signal was not given twice ;
Because we felt more lonely in the vast plain ,
Vengeance , not treason , have i wrought . "
Now christmas eve returning ,
Parched the flowers they bear along .
Youth has fled and we are old .
And fill 'd each pause the nightingale had made .
Daylight brings the living phantom ,
Of others woes he shares a part ;
The seed you 've sown with patience ,
I was moved by minstrelsy ,
They called for quaint old measures , which they trod
The pale which held that lovely deer :
Their fitful howls were borne upon the midnight air ;
And covers all their beauty with his wings ;
The sad procession moved ,
And make us happy in the darting bird
Encamped philistines lay upon the plain
The listening winds received this song :
His heart was breaking when she died :
And fills the town with tumult and dismay .
Anguish that straitens the breath ,
His crime demanded ; nor by savage beasts
Might ease the wound of warlike olivier ;
Still with his soul severe account he kept ,
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
His circuit round this globe shall seem to run .
It passed o'er him with mighty shock ,
Asserts his rank , and rises into man .
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore ,
With other children takes his place ,
Fast through ' er mind sweet thoughts were flitting --
Governor , he would take his orders from me .
There came a blue envelope in the mail today .
Soft , pleasant , filled with every pretty thought ;
Bleak inexpressiveness had leveled all .
There beneath the dewy hillside sleep the noblest
Nations are made the sacrifice .
So leeches stick , nor quit the bleeding wound ,
The waters broke my hollow trance ,
The leaves first fledged have lost as yet
" to bear my lonely lot ,
His life , till to the enchanted palace brought .
Those wings , whose very rustling shook the world !
From this day onward , which i feel begun
They pass as passes the wind in the desert .
That runs its silvery scales on every stream ;
Heaven with earth is banded :
As thus he filled his high exalted place ,
Must come to one whose suffering is acute .
Makes three strong roots creep around it ;
And feeling he the sword no more can guide ,
Of parting friends in close embraces bound .
What shall we care if our burdens be shifted ,
And gladly my improvements traced .
My lips went wandering on her face ,
Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark ,
Like liquid fire it ran through my veins .
Old sisters of a day gone by .
All europe felt that fiery blast ,
Of lofty praises ; for there came to me
Where ragged ditches ran
Bring youth and love to that deep summer-tide
No sweeter than flowers suddenly found growing
O the passionate tears that spring !
To the fold the shepherd drove his flocks ,
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore ,
The rest complains of cares to come .
May he his health retain aye .
Southward i turn my longing eyes ,
Nobler grave than that which held his brother .
Come and be made ashamed of thy renown !
Dilating so it finds not room therein ,
The startled fawn leaps swift , her glance dismayed
Softly we shake into the gulf of blue ,
And made him friends of mountains : with the stars
That gave their gifts , and went their way ;
When breakfast came with bottled beer ,
As the engine 's echoes rang ,
And to repentance and confession turn 'd ;
Life one eternal instant rose in dream
Therefore i pass to what time i awoke ,
Roman empire created a political unity which reflected in every
Which heats those ravished souls above ;
Have faded away like the grass that we tread .
That make it precious to its inmost core ?
Who , to secure pious content ,
When i to spread my feeble eyes begun :
And go with the hour .
Along the landscape lay
This cause made him who in his fury shared ,
Have found the fame your shores refuse :
The stain upon his silver down will stay .
Come share their leafy solitudes . grim death
Their mutual greetings duly made ,
For ony wife i see ;
The deed remarks , or notes the slain
Though the wind hath fallen , they drift along ,
Since this fair work was fashioned by the lore
Some pirates steered that way .
Must evil at his hands endure .
Its compass , widening the attentive throng .
The consecration has designed . ”
More benefits remain , and claimed as rights ,
And golden reins the immortal coursers hold .
Contented when thy bliss i see ,
Which make the sacrifice complete .
And joy and endless glory win .
That each should bown him for the border .
But unto them a true foundation gave ;
The heathens fly in rage and dread ;
His proper soul in kinship there is bound .
Yet , seeing there , chilled in her loveliness ,
And the rope that dragged him down to hell .
Shall always see !
And echo wafts the faint reply .
Sound with the music the sunshine is playing , --
Towards him , up the swerving road , there came
Up , your banner leads the van ,
But , to make very keen their appetite ,
Of love , which the men assoteth ,
Of yore her eagle wings unfurled .
Of the clouds about him rolled ,
A mellow , measured , melancholy sound .
With darker horror shook the conscious wood ,
Who touched with honour 's sacred flame ,
And thick gloom gathered , filling them with fear .
And the world 's victor stood subdued by sound ?
Straight the sorry tidings to every hunnish chief
Long from out my song will leave him ;
And wear a shape thy mood to fit ;
Save that in loving you my soul still soared .
To crown a seraph for the heaven it builds .
Swift rush the spectral vapours white
In many an orbit wheels , then lighting sits
Memory 's paws remain for sucking .
To pay the debt they owe to shame ;
And find that wisdom 's ways are pleasantness ,
No charm to wealthy pride will owe ;
Words of scorn on our franks he cast :
And the sooty faces , they try to recall ....
And find strange beauty mirrored there ;
And withered famine urged the work of death ;
A moan of music from the darkness sighed ,
Be found more chill and still to him than i.
By entering soon into the marriage state .
Into a constant harmony , and found
Drink , and fill the night with mirth !
To follow up the worthiest till he die :
They mount -- how short a voyage brings
Crumbs of bread among it throw ;
Shall unknown nations , touched by western strife ,
Caesar , with strength increased and gathered troops
For so thy wisdom saw that it was best
Destroys perhaps the strength that time would spare :
While cycles unnumbered their centuries run ,
This ranks all other lore above --
I wish to god i could pluck it out --
Tenfold precious the vengeance that comes after lingering years !
A thrill that trembled to her petal-tips ,
For sickly souls the priest was made ;
A year has gone , as the tortoise goes ,
God and the mother of god have dropped asleep .
" all that day raged the war they waged ,
No help in any face of them she found
Where scarlet dyes bathe torture 's womb !
We draw our life ; a sense that makes
The hearts of homes beating true to duty .
The beauty it resolves ;
And came back crowned with wealth and power .
Here where the summer stands , her lap of green
Here spread the fields that heaped their ripened store
Dread thoughts which rose within her faithful breast .
The king of the swedes his followers leads ,
Now to her task the milkmaid goes .
The trooping of prayers lost upon the void ,
And bring good tidings of my daughter dear !
But not a sound comes from his lips ,
But folly has raptures to give .
She drove at once . so fell the overthrow ,
The heaven unexpected came ,
All summer long , which winter fills again .
Th ' angelicall soft trembling voyces made
Take all the rest the sun goes round !
Until the iron latch bar hit the slot .
To break with life the circling spell of death .
And sigils framed in planetary hours .
Nor grasp the present with pitiful , mortal hand ,
Oh , say , where goes your love ?
To nature ’s will , their course pursue ;
But follow me , ye cavaliers ,
Your lif and ek your good to save ;
His final hour brings glory to his god !
That came to my ears three suns later :
Give water to our fevered eyes , give strength
A sound must long remain ;
For him my soul was sorely moved :
Awhile she sits in cruel thought ,
Your waking eyes , which never grow
The sun went warm from core to rind ;
The outward beauty fed their mental mood .
Where autumn 's leaves are lying :
A date-palm throws its heavy fronds of steel
The whistle sang like a bird when he blew ,
Hard was the heart that gave the blow ,
So maggie runs , the witches follow ,
Fast silent tears were flowing ,
The mustering storm betrayed :
If i the power possessed ;
Next these , a youthful train their vows expressed ,
Shine through my hopeless tears . my drooping sails
Then asunder went their helms ,
The charm that the great spirit gives you .
Taking some spark to glad the hearth , or light
That faced my three-plank bed ,
And gentle words that mother would give ,
That silence makes
For all this came a ruin : side by side
And incense veiled the rood .
Her going is good . our conditions mend ;
With drifting clouds , that trail the shadowy shower .
The skill of law to aged folkes belong ,
While now and then a growl came from
Far away the waves would wash it . "
The paleness o’er his cheek that stole .
Only when peace prevails may we behold
I know where erring passion leads ,
Who would not follow her whose glory sits ,
Drag me with life that keeps death shadow-near
Now rosy may comes in wi ' flowers ,
Autumn comes , her prospects glow
He had chased the unfaithful people in their fear ,
That unto these dread rites belonged , was done ;
This swells the tumult and the rage of fight ;
Fear 's clammy hands clutch at my heart !
The ills that man on man would throw ;
So cruel to the child who brought her aid .
The cross , where all our sins were laid ,
To see what my black hen doth lay .
Met his , and this reply was made :
That speech so fine should be so thrown away !
Who nobly fell for athens or for rome .
And heaped up mountains high of christians dead ,
Who thus could form a line and fight again ;
Around him next the regal mantle threw ,
The forms of fancy come and go .
Though all the waters that upbore it then
The terror of her eyes , but drew and sped
No soul could sink beneath his love , --
Give their last days to solitude and rest .
For i fell asleep , and dreamt three hundred ,
Great fleecy ones all filled with light ,
And other wonders cities bring to pass ;
And her ears keep the whispers of many lovers ,
The first of persian lands he shines upon .
That shook to golden throbbing all the sea .
The lamentation , heaving many a groan ,
Saw to their passions that mankind were slaves ,
The great ontario -- and a steamer take .
When shall my muse , transported with the theme ,
To scorn his power and be it therefore seen ,
There , far as the eye could scan ,
The lightning of her eyes to form ?
Showeth its incompetence
To them i hold that we are bound
In laws by human artists bound .
A mortal sovereign holds her dangerous throne ,
That emperour calls on his franks again :
All parts there made one prisoner .
Which conscience gives , and nothing can destroy .
' i 'm fighting to defend a lie .
His youthful curls , kissed straight and sheen
Who of his faith gives goodly warrant ; they
My soul that 's lost in babylon . ~ "
His pleasures with thee wrought .
I must not give to common fame ,
Boldly place the poet bryant .
Brings from the dust the sound of liberty !
Thy mirth lay aside ,
In one dread crime a twofold virtue seen ,
Was such fair glance as comes from virgin love ,
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy .
For nature includes raffael , as we know ,
But custom cries : " disown it :
And only tears give weight unto my words .
In which god 's truth and love are shown ,
Life waits till the heart has lived too much
When glimmering waves shine through deep rifts
On brows of prayer a blessing pour ;
But he went on : -- an answer came ,
And to her logyng went her way .
Then thus to hermes the command was given :
Accidents will come to heroes ,
May not remember , much less tell the sound .
And stirs the green woods that it wanders through ,
As thro ' the pines the breezes play ,
When the soul loves tumultuous solitude ,
Till the swift sun his annual circle made .
Thus hermes in the dream ; then took his flight
Where weeds had pushed , and tiles and broken glass
Active it finds , to its own substance draws ,
Whose light hands once held the reins of france .
Her marble wrought , her music breathed ;
Of verdant boughs composed to place a bier ,
Lean as the shadow cast by a church spire ,
Of feeling touched , has made me think --
When nane on earth can ken .
Of grace hath come , without baptismal rites
And flush the features when the soul hath fled !
With that large wisdom which the ages teach --
Make an end of thy deception .
I think that i am drawing to an end :
Now with the almost finished task make haste ;
A trail of following flames ascending drew :
And light is mingled with the gloom ,
The dream on which religion rests .
The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet
And they are rising through the hollow world .
This makes thee blessed peace so light to hold ,
Sorrow and i would share !
Why waste the time in dull delay ? ”
His ashes make a horrid noise
And the sunlight warmed and softened .
Hear and regard the caution thou hast given ;
I ask whence draws my breast the noble fire ?
That soon our time must come
Whose modesty hung out red flags on each cheek ,
Her rippling laughter floated through the room ,
From which the prophets drew , and none beside .
A countenance in which did meet
It in her heart there lies
No sorrow we shall find :
And all her sunny hair lay free
Of retribution fiercely works in me . "
Whom nature hath made apt for every change !
Soon a heaviness came o'er me ,
Which gives the semblance of perpetual spring
Is but ruined by his witchcraft ;
Our years enjoyably have sped .
But o light body love should soon restore ,
Where is the scholar whose clear mind can hold
A little chapel fits a little choir ;
Each trojan bosom with new warmth he fires .
Worn , and with watching , gentle sleep subdued ;
The soul foreknows its eternity .
To the heart whose pulses elsewhere measure only
Often sung when i was building ,
House of them to whom the twilight calls .
Such fierce assault , was taken by the foe .
Who , stabbed with pangs too sharp to bear ,
Among the forest greens , vaulted upon him ,
You 'll turn it to such capital account !
To carry that wonderful nose .
All the words the sign-post tells .
In the stream of life that wandered bye .
The clamour of carts goes down the street :
Could other offerings leave except her tears ,
Still shines the truth that for the pilgrim shone .
And to the work his thought applied .
Beauty of form and life and light , and breathes
To meet its stare so dread .
That when the light falls dimmer ,
In which thine altars ready stand !
Want gave tongue , and , at her howl ,
( such as make happy days and restful nights )
( that dreadful oath which binds the thunderer )
Or , winding through the vallies , gay ,
If ever the day came when he was rich ,
His nature with her shivering faith ran yoked .
A nice and subtle happiness , i see ,
While the river flows to meet the sea !
He gives a rare pinch when he likes . "
And by that laugh the willing fair is found .
What interchanging hints between us pass ;
They fought as foes -- gave blow for blow .
This art would waste the bitterness of death .
As it pass 'd me flying by --
She has hopped from spray to spray ,
Of the ruin of knossos goes there .
Patroclus sprang like mars with fierce intent and a terrific
If still the paths of lore she follow ,
Fresh october brings the pheasant ;
The direst of divine things made ,
And you may find in love these different parts --
But never give them cause for jesting .
All the offers that they made her ,
Nor yield to anger ’s mastering sway .
And they take comfort in the same
Bringing upon its rainbow wings to me
Now turned his thirtieth year ; when he arrived
His living temples , built by faith to stand ,
O'er-leaning leaves temper my languid heat ,
And angry thunder grumbled through the hills ,
Between the ships that followed and her light ,
Came a broken murmur of voices .
Where in the grey church still her people bend ,
Are those who looked to christ already come .
With a full peace , that never can depart
The lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven .
The frost had set him rigid as a log ;
The fire of poetry within him burning ;
Blithe as the wind was bitter , drew
The ship that brought them sails this very hour ,
Nor does fatigue so short a toil succeed , "
On the morrow stood to challenge ; in their strength
But fortune 's gifts if each alike possessed ,
O did it speak of hearts estranged ,
Except the heaven had come so near ,
For possession feeds the fire .
Nor any breeze made murmur through the boughs ,
From what fair fountain mortal life arose ,
No pity then her heart can feel ,
And gives no rest to his distracted heart :
So forty , fifty , sixty passed ;
Who give themselves and give the city no peace ,
For other hopes , and thy proud fortunes claim .
There is it seen , how he his blooming age
Answered in the words which follow :
And when they lifted up their songs of glee ,
That wrapped him like a funeral-shroud .
Nor what wild tides thy beams control .
Those mighty limbs that felt no pain .
As it came softened up the hill ,
So sad a sigh has brought ? '
Fortune changed made him so ,
Westward on the war-path met them ;
And it spoke the words which follow :
Nor cast one longing lingering look behind ?
By all that beauty going as man bade ,
No longer the warfare , ungodly , would wage ;
There he dwelt , while years passed over ,
So for a brief space , clad in ecstasy ,
But my body caught up in the whirl and drift
A glorious voice came singing from the sun ,
Pouring the wine . their hearts beat high with hope
The road she chose to-day was run
Lone wandering , but not lost .
And away it proceeds ,
To life and strength my friends recall ,
Spoke the very words which follow ;
The wavering flames rise high ,
Where my last milestone stands abide
Brings back the swelling tide of memory ,
Severed from us , can neither feel nor be ,
Full in his face their wings expand .
The victory gained , again you 're blest ,
For on the centre sore the battle lay :
The echoes are left to their slumbers ,
Sets earth at distance ; casts her into shades ;
My heart goes back to wander there ,
Their fate proclaimed as fortune 's smile or frown ;
The night in dancing flew :
Against the painted wall . my heart threw wide
To show that it was ill .
There gently lay the roots , and there
She held a psalter painted green and red .
Many a kingdom sought he in his manly mood ,
Blind bartimeus , hold thy peace !
And made it send its flickering shafts of light into
It leaves you broken hearted .
To war and arms i fly .
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high .
And heaven puts on the blue of may .
To feel a fever always in your breast ;
With fury as his voice he raised :
With far faint hues of waking loves first hinting ,
To deale for composition from the king :
They spent their all repairing baseball fences danny broke .
And as all love doth live again
And left their music lingering on its strings .
Treading the dark with challenge and reply .
Ere the soul of man had risen .
Which youthful dreamers see ,
As round ev'ry world it goes --
He giveth songs in the night .
Their faults i will discover ;
She saw the future . susan price was there .
The car tydides to his comrades gave ,
Heaven send your heart-strings aye in tune ,
Through shadows passed to his crown of light .
Their mead of praise from some may win ;
And then a sickly sun peered in
That ran beneath that ladye 's bed ?
To all a splendour seems to cling .
Enjoy thy youth , it will not stay ;
For the deceitful counsel which he gave .
And fading hang their mourning heads ;
And earnest thoughts within me rise ,
Pass through ten gates , across four bridges run ,
Itself unseen , yet all things by it shown .
And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall
Has waved o'er freedom 's land !
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
That with me then an equal fortune ran ;
_ to be forming good habits up there ;
Now seeing him thus to good humour inclined ,
Examples may be found of such pursuits :
Each day brings a fresh reinforcement --
And the clear lake reflect the fairest hues ;
Who so well all that makes up good poetry knows
To paint , this picture that thyself hast given
Thus , while with joy his pulses beat ,
Here i should faint , reflecting on my theme ,
Who spends his lifetime in heavy sighs , --
Has joined m'durmer 's gang .
Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits ,
Hath come on her , a chilly fear ,
Into court his brother came
And filled with my affection .
The western tide crept up along the sand ,
Will form a constellation ,
Of a new rainbow ere it fret or fade ,
This earthly comfort find ;
And the danger hovering near .
Can not find the words of magic ,
Of the virgin mary , filled with grace .
Like winds that rest upon a rose ;
Arrests them with a charm 'd surprise .
That which before us lies in daily life ,
Or , if they see , the shortening days
This ring the grateful monarch gave ,
Were forged the things that make us great ;
This gives you a safe pint to rest on ,
More strong and strong her terrors rose ; --
Came the roar from the southward that night .
A broad flower blazing with light at noon ,
That fans the grave whare julia lies .
The blazing fire , and forth there came
Your word of faith my courage doth inspire ;
Radiant with tin and gold the chariot ran ,
Right always comes to take the place of wrong ,
Which the midnight hags went sailing through ,
New realms of beauty waited for his rule ;
The lonely mansion lay ;
They come from beds of lichen green ,
Shall sleep to rise refreshed and strong
And over all a mighty change had come ;
All of them filled with spirits miserable .
Far distant again they each other confronted .
The nightingale shyly took
Fronting the day 's descent across green slopes ,
Here -- where the summer breezes waved the wood --
And the waves lie still in the sun
The robber goes to plunder what he can ;
And yet you wonder where the years have fled .
And snatch the groaning world from civil war .
That here no solace of rest may find ,
That darkness is about to pass .
Are those , which make thee beat thy wings below
And o , before the daylight goes ,
Till the river runs a banker ,
As far as the whale-ships go .
For ever , where such grace is given ,
I breathe my native air , and tread the soil
Where ideals float like clouds , we owed to france
Or shall there come at last desire of waking ,
Then they gain them glory : they are given rewards
Shall liberty follow
As made my childish days rejoice !
And each firm breast devotes itself to death ,
And shed a bitter tear .
With twice the aerial sweetness it had brought !
And there lay them safe and sound ;
That stands all fame beyond ,
That the voice moved , but sooner was extinct
Is wildly beat by winter 's icy flail ,
While thy stars made mirth ,
What words remain to speak will not offend her .
Of emerald flecked with candle-light .
The ties of love more firmly bind ,
Where greece rolled back the persian tide ? _
This prayer had lived to save again
In the snow was nearly sinking ,
To make the listener feel the truth divine
The animal spirits , that from pure blood arise
Prodigious power had shown , and met in arms
And gave a letter to this one and that ,
That kept the violets blue .
A consolation gleams through blinding tears !
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow ,
And every tear would turn a mill ,
_ his faith forbade with other tribe to join
Upon thy brow that time may yet erase .
Lonely through life , but looking for the day
And ward the firebrands from her sacred fleet .
Through its ensanguined openings made lament .
And the waters lay smooth as a silver shield ,
I went my tranquil way .
From the cares which keep us still in prison .
I see the peach-flowers bearing crystal rain ,
With startled faces . voices rose and fell ,
And his measures are as follow :
Whose railing heroes , and whose wounded gods ,
King charlemagne , had raised another force .
The very beam in which the snow-wreath wears
And heart from soul draws grace ,
That followed died upon their lips
And here the trembling needle sought the north ,
And from them shone a gleam of crimson dawn ,
To stay the fierce flame where it came .
They 're only wishes sent ter god ,
And then as coroner merival takes proof
The frail white stars moved slowly over the sky .
Moving but as the feelings move ,
Ere yet was lost the art divine ;
Marvelous darkness shadow 'd o'er the place .
Some , when the springtime had grown to december ,
Still makes it more , still fills the golden bowl
Through life goes joy , exchanging joy with all .
The wondrous clay from her own spittle made ,
To light the spoiler on destruction 's path .
A fervency that would not harbor doubt ,
That gently shakes the silver trees
What wealth the show to me had brought :
And lead him through the various maze of taste .
Never a burden that he doth not bear ;
Following from world to world intent i seek . "
To give rebuke or death , and if ye wail
And mighty joy his heart possessed .
To hear the glad earth sing .
The song runs round again .
His stature reached the sky , and on his crest
The lancet was by blisters follow 'd ,
Of my leaving you menaced by poverty . "
The sweetest anthem autumn ever made
For kings should use the sword they bear ,
Memory , like a fiend , shall follow ,
That scoffs at human prayers ,
He made himself to be the son of god .
That cradled in their folds the infant dawn .
And take the legacy i leave to you ,
His pluck told its tale , and his strength ,
Winds blow south , or winds blow north ,
That old restriction , murmurs reach it still ,
Tongue that uttered such a lay ?
Where love lies waking with the fragrant stars --
To dart at every thing that flies .
My courage won thy love . so well i fought
The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed ,
There 's a path that leads to nowhere
The curse had fallen upon our heads -- the sword
Onward comes the battle line , --
The hues of death assume .
" to make the dark world bright ;
Along the deck the festive board is spread :
When will return the glory of your prime ?
Comes with a troop of demons to conduct
White in the moon the long road lies ,
The wind comes stealing o'er the grass
Break away as a dream of pain
There , pallor o’er his features spread ,
The violets said the eyes were blue ,
And overcome by memories that could brook
Than ours , holding hearts so light and glad .
He leap 'd amid a murderous band ,
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought :
His light like a smile comes glancing
I knew my home where i had choice to feel
The glancing splendours as their sandals play .
Cruel echo mocked at her wild alarms ,
And ere the wrath paled or that sunset died ,
Elate for freedom leaps the starry power ,
But the years come and go ,
His virtues walk 'd their narrow round ,
And the anemones that april brings
We held that we could not abide a week
Thy virtues in my mind shall ever dwell ;
Close in their cold and narrow coffins pent ,
Grace of the soft ideal , seldom shown ,
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears .
And each had shown how light we far 'd along
These gestures of the past they shew .
With sense enough to grasp a law
Till you have made their saddened faces bright .
Nor stands thy wrath deprived of its reproof ,
Finding but emptiness everywhere .
They fanned me with impetuous sighs ,
And fills each crevice in the world with day .
The rising tempest puts in act the soul ,
Which that tradesman scattered then ,
There go the carriages , -- look alive !
To crowd thy various gifts , the sage assign 'd
If the conqueror takes them by storming or gold ?
The sunshine seems blown off by the bleak wind ,
Ogier was grown content to live and die
Having your rents to prey upon .
Then from the breaking clouds fell torrent showers ;
Through these my waves advance your fearless prows ,
Her tears and kisses fell in one :
A scar -- brought from some well-won field
The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet
That makes the changing seasons gay ,
With their fiery breath made answer ,
How such as he are made to smart .
And knowledge still extends the golden chain ;
That lay in the house that jack built .
Till death puts a stop to it .
With wings that dip beyond the silver seas .
Lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air ,
Her meaning and devoutly serve ;
Making the whole earth warm .
That grieved and doubted , it came to pass
But then my courtship days come back to me --
When mary stay 'd beneath . but not to deal
Back to her early home once more will turn ,
As may with envy swell the neighbouring stream .
As now i recall it -- is gravely severe ,
Where spices breathe , and brighter seasons smile ,
Less doubtful , as that worthy shade complied .
And made them the text of his sermon ,
Do cast reflected multiples , and try
As i lose myself in the infinite main ,
Her memories go foraging
Regions they passed , the mighty regencies
That painting has attained its uttermost ;
Where our harbor reaches seemed
O , let me share thy cross of grief ,
Of love that comes to this !
But clutching brambles stayed her flight ;
And would you fare this lonely way ,
Echoed the bacchanalian din they made .
Taking wit in her anger , and courage beside ;
No nerve twitched in my face , although i felt
She shares the eternal calm .
The rugged knobs blend into heaven 's own hue !
The riotous companies melt to a pair .
A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw ;
O cruelty , the insight barred me then !
Until god 's sword destroys this monstrous curse .
The figure which the spirit lost , its skin
" and fell into such fit of deep despair ,
The lily 's withered chalice falls
That strength which once in boiling youth i knew ;
The homage paid him had been less ; you see
And my young heart knew hope without a fear .
Enough of that ! thy love sits lonely yonder ,
But when did kindness fail to find
Soft pity to infuse :
My pool a gentle ripple sends .
So flows the good with equal law
In golden chains the willing world she draws ,
Of charm that had capped all nigh ,
The wind sat in the poop ; rinaldo good
Such health do my fountains bestow ;
Grow saving stars to guard one hopeless head .
On him what various gifts did heaven confer ! --
Dreads not the storms that lash the sounding main :
And so reach heaven and thee at length .
The soul selects her own society ,
His wish by hers was echoed ; and her knights
To catch the last _ too _ tender glance
And the moon gave no light !
Winter shows us
The wicked cavaliers did run
Thus addressed the flame of ukko :
The thunderer seated , from the gods apart .
A coldness seemed to strike , and now each limb
The dead leaves fluttered round her , and she sate
And scornful hisses run through all the crowd .
Truth without love its mark must often miss ,
Through clearest skies might take united flight . "
Having got the wolf , by the same high law
In sumptuous apparel , wafted upon the flood .
“ they feel no fright for faulchions ,
Of those high words of truth which search and burn
As the doomed darkness backward by him rolled ,
From thee the son of mary came ,
I took my bannet aff my head ,
To keep the glory of the empire bright .
And found deep plunged in gloomy thought ,
And all in flight their safety sought .
My kiss would not hurt thee !
The scent that issues from the apple-tree ,
And the ebbing sea-wave sighed .
God controls the fate of nations ,
Thy magic art deceived and stole :
Then many a wound the ruthless weapons made .
There kept my charms concealed from mortal eye ,
Arrested and suspended at god 's word ,
I stand in adoration ,
Consider what you do , and whither go .
Shall pierce the foggy cerement
And scorn to spare the life that shall return .
Fought and battled for a title
Everything tells us to expect nothing more from
Foul language at the elder throw ;
A monarch passes , without a crown ,
By that self-doubt are shadowed and undone .
Lost in the irrecoverable past ?
What death lay on her breast ,
With them the seed of wisdom did i sow ,
Dank his weeds around him cling ;
And in it so much poison lies concealed ,
The world holds hate in fee --
Virtue early finds sepulture ,
What each day means itself will say ;
O sweet-passioned spirit , shining home !
But silence spreads the couch of ever welcome rest .
It brings before the eyes of faith
Of wrath on lebanon . before we see ,
Great spring came singing upward from the south ;
By the fount where love was plighted
Beat balm upon our eyelids . hither came
The deep gorge stretches to a night of pine ,
Though saturated with all forms of crime ,
Embracing held her , yielding , subdued ;
So kissing and crying kept company .
And whose soul lost in that one hour
And longing flows in the trickling , fairy notes
On love 's burning altar lies ,
And earth shall give thee all it can bestow .
And dying see no child succeed .
Of his great crime made him wish to commence
“ close by his throat the pointed mischief stood .
To timeless night and chaos , whence they rose .
No soothing potion needs to take ,
And all the busy factors come
They never grieve at all for sands that run ,
But this with gratitude we note ,
As men from jails to execution go ;
The turkish monarch sat with juda 's king .
The good from evil to discern ,
This night shall bring completion , and shall give
The heath has lost its bloom ;
Ambition sighed : she found it vain to trust
And lift me from the drowsy deep ...
Because she makes the whole world sweet .
Wouldst make me mad beyond the daily curse
No wind blew -- only the wandering air that grows
This day will go an exile hence ,
Nor yet more comfort brought the gloomy night ,
Here , kisses fallen upon earth from the mouth of
And beauty , all concentrating like rays
Than glowing coals , that give them light .
I spoke of the sunshine caught in her hair ;
How the young bear kept his faith
Your lips shall press the sweetest song ,
Where filled with terror and despair ,
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal ,
To see what rare delights they yield ....
But fear comes not where duty is ,
As it drifted through the gorge .
While the dream of the past stood before him ;
No days are wasted half as much as those !
The shattered idol of our love
And captive chains the rageful leader bound .
The worth of what our follies leave :
The arrow drew ; whereat sharp anguish shot
When first life trembled in her limbs and smiled ,
Which evermore is given them for a grief .
A divinity shaped his ends .
There all that art has taught to bloom ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
They sank down in that flame -- and slept
And the winter comes to stay ! "
That faith , hope , love , may flourish there
Change was wrought on all about him ,
Of tossing waters wild and unconfined :
For she lovingly poured out her blessings in streams
We bleed anew in every former grief ,
But i could frame a wish for thee
" give us a song ! " the soldiers cried
And the charm of the carol rapt me ,
This brought her after all her grief and fear ,
She fell in love with an irishman ,
As a school let loose to its errant will ,
Was cold for scent and brought hounds to noses .
To calm their passion with the words of age ,
Here vainly shall my fates upon me call .
The kind of woman i should take to wife ,
Sarga the sixth -- krishna made bolder
And phoebe half her nightly race had run .
Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed
Mourn perish 'd hope , or pour remorseful fear ;
He caught the vision of a face , --
Far and wide the tidings spread ;
This word did mahomet say unto me ,
Now are your wishes come true , come true !
Is going full split for a win .
I felt the brave persistence of the grass ;
Yet in one breast the spirit of freedom rose
Or he must fall and sleep without his fame ,
With burning passion of stretched eyes ,
It marries music with the human lyre ,
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
Whose limbs take root and spread forth constantly ;
He took flight and rose high away .
Him only since great hector met his end .
A worldly heart within his frame made new ,
Till the fierce din to pleasing murmurs fell ,
But draw the golden drops from weeping purses ?
This the red flag that burns above our strife ,
The horrid shock . now storming fury rose ,
That breaks his magic chains at curfew time ,
Ears strung to palpitations of heart throbs
Then light is laid upon the peaks ,
Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure .
Then coo-my-doo took flight and flew
To make thee doubt his faith and lay
That from the breast whence such a cry escaped ,
Shall they not wear one hatred out as well ?
The winds shall bring us , as they blow ,
Some music still wand ' ring , unstrung
While poseidon 's trident their power shall own ,
And that might lead from duty 's path astray ;
Out of the night of death arose the sound .
Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage .
The tears that down their faces rolled ,
And when they shake their wings ; alas !
A breeze came wandering from the sky ,
But unity stands next to nil ; --
The happy winds their timbrels took ;
Your words sustained my courage ,
Nor feel the blindness , stain , corruption , more
The summer like a stranger comes ;
Where hopeless anguish pour 'd his groan ,
Suffer if one of modern mood steals back --
Bewitching charms bred all my harms ; --
It makes me long to sail for lands unknown ,
Pensive he eyes , before him spread
Would also cross his mind and make him sigh ;
A face so gentle and so passing fair ? "
The western breezes that spring is bringing ,
Their shields they smote asunder / that the sparks began
Of passion which hath made thee venture here .
To show that one heart was loyal yet .
To wilderness my steps i first addressed ,
Within them met and blended with the blue ,
The little stars sat one by one ,
But no objection could be made ,
As brighter ladies do not count it strange ,
And shall i make known your honours ?
A supper such as gods might share .
So passion 's dreamings fall ,
For christ can protect thy life , reflect ,
My same old sorrow comes creeping out .
But found no answer in the smoky roof ,
With reverence when their names are breathed ,
Give me but what this ribbon bound ,
Which holds three persons in one substance knit .
A soul reclaimed , an atom born anew :
Fire to drive thee from my presence ,
From mars ’s arm the enormous weapon fled :
And take for quite reverse this medley farce ,
Then conscious preference rose ; then northward turn 'd
All haste , and wholly leans to kind accord ,
Long hours flowed by in silence . now the night
Pale wavering reflections rose from out the city ,
The scourge is red , the spur drops blood ,
Who held four years the papalist ?
Holds keener anguish in its orb of brine ,
What nations subject , and what friends he brings ;
The care and pains this somehow stole from me )
In his breath finds life .
The threatening billow comes with hollow roar ,
The memory mixes with the vision , spoils
And their heavenly voices rang
And , day by day , within thy spirit grew
From the meadow brook steals in ,
And , all mutation over , stretch me down
And power and strength from the ten horns received ,
't was idle glory moved thee there :
Therefrom the sweetness only found in thee .
And his heart smiled within him ,
With horror ever deepening from the first .
And the waves make room for it .
With a faithful heart i 'll keep .
Where with his wife he late had converse held ;
My double treasure death has filched from me ,
Every hope is fled ,
Stain our immortal birth :
That here upon thy path has risen ;
Which cease not till he sees his duty clear ,
And shook the ghostly jasmine . a great moon
There was a voice which sang about thy spring ,
With sweet flesh patterned where the cool turf pressed ,
All scythia 's fame to thine should yield
Of conflict crowned and drowned in olives of peace ;
To give a wide sail to the gale ,
And the fair night the rosy horizon invaded .
The shadow of our fame is growing !
To lean in joy upon our father 's knee ;
Gods ! shall one raging hand thus level all ?
Which made my heart to glow ;
There fell a war in a woody place ,
Her eyes are full of light and fixed on something
Too soon to lose that everlasting hope
The oak leviathans , whose huge ribs make
I cherish his because in me it bides :
That gives them back their fathers ' heritage :
All brings a picture tender .
That lay in the house that jack built .
Here and there the fire has caught him ,
A beauty death can never take ,
Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew ,
The man who hits my fancy .
The firmament breaks up . in black eclipse
The power which in forbearance lies ,
Rides on with victory leading him .
There came a voice , that needle to the star
Such torture he felt he could scarce endure ;
To proteus every day should one be led .
Cold from the spring the waters pass
And so i got preferment .
First as i loved her when the darkness passed .
While amorous breezes linger round ,
And to heights of rapture raised ,
Till checked by death 's congealing power ,
Lashed with terror , leashed with longing ,
Those qualities upon which friendship lives .
To doom the famine , yet proclaim the bliss ,
The radiant beauty shed abroad
To these dire ships the british monsters bring --
The lazy summer hours were wont to pass ;
And the tulip tricked out finest ,
Which tired the heart and brought no gain .
Great gifts of countless price she bore ,
And the waves drive on the vessel ,
The end we sought is not attained ,
Peace charmed the street beneath her feet ,
Nothing but rusty bones as it lies
't is a brother 's hand that 's lifted
Then , rolling back , the powers of troy opposed
What needeth then apologies be made ,
His breathings came so fierce and fast ,
Where once they made their haunt , was emptiness .
Would give you more pleasure than any thing there
Found favour , from her it was gathered most .
And find thee knowing , not of beasts alone ,
And should dirt its original purity hide ,
If what parts can so remain . '
At bagley , where the rustling bluebells come
My soul can reach , when feeling out of sight
That thou art altogether fixt to leave
Each finds a different fate .
" descending hence unto the lowest powers ,
So hardie as to proffer or accept
To hear what fortune is approaching me ,
And the low valleys dipt in sunny sleep .
And helen 's lovely daughter sought to wed ;
Thou standest alone as the nightingale sings !
In came the flock : the fat weary woman ,
Aim to extend their empire o'er the ball ,
As the crisp north wind comes bustling by ,
Three things render us strong ,
Held by her own apart , some impious tale
The dull stream slowly creeps a shallow thread , --
Nine fathom deep he had follow 'd us
Where tuned to praise is every sigh and prayer .
Whose sweetness doth excel
For the world 's progress what was ever made
And hope and doubt alternate seize her soul .
My answered prayer came up to me ,
Blinded by the light that glared ,
With tears his eyelids pressing ,
The nightingales breathe out their souls in song .
And here exactly follows what he said : --
More than one heart could hold .
I feel thee near once more !
Was formed for all the miracles he wrought :
And she reduced to beaky skin ,
In mary 's church to hang on high .
Duly as friday comes , though press 'd herself
But isabel was glad when sunday came
( this metaphor is freely taken
To name the bubbling hope that he is bringing .
Straightway draws his blade of battle ,
Simple simon went a-fishing ,
And keeps the fame our sons shall keep .
Our feet shall catch the elastic bound ,
So loose abroad that virtue 's self is sold ,
When the prized objects it has raised for prayer ,
Thus vents his anguish to the fleeting air :
An gives one leap from april into june
" but thou canst turn a face of cheer
And feel a martyr through and through ,
He 's dead alone that lacks her light !
Pure soul , possessed by ardent love ,
With mercifull regard give mercy to .
With the hurt of the wounds it bore .
They caught and rode , both silent , while remorse
High on the seat the cabinet they bind :
Their hearts , like shadows feeling for their rest
Everywhere the old sad sins find _ room _ .
That kindly providence its care is showing
Alas for love when love goes wandering !
And fix the eye firmer on heaven .
Which same could stand a buryin ' ,
He , fondly clinging to his fancied sire ,
Was laid upon them by their lady gay ,
The calm of tyranny that can not change .
There let it lie , a thing of naught .
Like to a falcon issuing from the hood ,
The stern breeze , and the hour invites repose .
For bringing thee into this misery . ”
And give it a place in my diary here ,
A charming picture , there you stand ,
Bade the waves sunder and temptations fly ,
And the purple sunset sets fire to the sky ?
Delights that slip away as fish through water .
Man by transgression lost ? -- the noble thought
There to get the lid in colors ;
Voluptuous july held her lover , earth ,
All those from mortals sprung , --
The green graves rise in silence near ,
The wanderer breathed his last .
That belladonna made the glance ,
And earth that streamed with blood was strown
Peace and esteem is all that age can hope .
Till the last , last flicker goes
And gray hairs coming , fortune slip like sand .
Since first the use of syllables was granted .
When not a soul would comfort my distress !
While my inmost soul is stirred .
His pure devotion brought ;
Stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief .
Thy prison-house , raised one imploring cry --
It made me light and gave me wings .
The dull cold river broke in sparkling foam ,
But thus our fortune casts the hapless die ,
The footmen throng in close battalions pressed ;
My heart seemed full as it could hold ;
And the wind for ever rocked them ,
It holds shadow-canes and umbrellas , and all
My sorrowful lute hath haply brought
" i pipes my eye as the rope goes by
Of existence . all evils the world ever saw
Its gauzy , splendid wings had spread ,
Here lay the child , with life 's warm essence
Thine own sunshine dost thou bring ,
My heart of thoughts that made it ache ,
The phantoms of a battle came to dwell
And the sixth heaven her lovely form receives .
As oft looked forward to the solemn day
Of vices thy worn spine was hurt to follow .
But night was crowding up the barren fells ,
On weak , clipped wings my wishes fly .
Between her breasts that never yet felt trouble
The neck that made that white robe wan ,
Is all that nature meant for men :
And valour as a guide before him goes .
The treasure of the tomb brought wealth to us ,
Then others , following these my mightiest knights ,
And the sacred incense rose .
If this belief from heaven be sent ,
My poor heart then break it must ,
Are your sorrows hard to bear ?
She taking care of all he chanced to get .
In this is seen imagination 's guilt ;
Where haughty tyrants once bore rule
And now the gates where evening sol descends ,
A stream of sad and solemn splendour lies ;
Flowers expand their light and soul-like wings ;
Summer shed its shining store ;
The noise of water dropping filled the air .
On earth arises .
His love hath set on eolen ,
From whose rough bosoms sprang imperial rome ,
The pulses flying through my frame , died out .
And with this tribute paid to knightly glory
The death that makes ethereal life would bind :
Hallowing the human wrath to war divine .
And the calm moon rose , lighting up the flowers
And leave the people desolate .
What music tune them , what affection fire ?
But what thy own foot makes betray thy home ,
Now this and now that care upon him wrought ;
' neath the pine trees ever sighing ,
That was bliss to make my sorrows flee !
With smiles that like red bubbles shine ! _
When sunday comes , he will again be here !
The way to vanquish or evade ;
Whose conduct prov 'd , whose goodness told ,
So grand a reputation could boast before ,
What verse can sing , what prose narrate ,
Thou shalt spread the woodland cheer ,
Where the sea flower spreads its leaves of blue ,
Where we find the joy of loving ,
And pity the sad things that creep below --
Seemed alien to my thoughts and held no part .
While snow flowers frail on twigs and branches lie .
Cry , as the wild light passes along , --
Nor he his nature changed by changing ground .
And when the battle fell away at night
On winds of passion my heart was blown ,
That never air or ocean felt the wind ;
And each hid radiance there ,
Because adonis ' heart hath made mine hard . '
The voyage will not enter :
One kiss he lays upon her lips so proud ,
From the highways dust rising in our view ;
To falls of acrid tears ,
Than all that went before . "
Rich with the flowery load they bore .
Which we pointers consider as part of the fun .
While the air like elysium is smiling above ,
As from a lethargy at once they rise ,
To tempt him into sin . did he regard
The highway of this world is set with thorns ,
Each hour prescribed by ráma ’s vow ,
Pressing our hands and nerves against warm darkness
It moved and moved , and took at last
Framing all heavens gave such as should them guide ,
Until we feel a match once more
When this blest thought of rapture moves us --
The hare has still more heart to run
And pours his life through each resounding line ,
That hue which the dun shades of hell concealed .
And then , ere i would answer , silence falls
All seasons could control ;
Can such a trifle turn you from your profit ?
Give to the winds thy fears , 193 .
That gives the happy chance of doing good ,
But the saxons were keeping christmas ,
Though deepest shades o'er outward nature roll ,
As it played lover over your sweet sleeps ;
To michigan , florida perfumes shall tenderly come ,
And , missing still the royal sire ,
Has come a lustre of crimson ,
And pleased remembrance builds delight on woe .
His tail froze one cold night , you see ;
But they got what i could give them ,
For spring shall return , and a lover bestow ,
Through sweet flowery meadows continually stray .
And find no punishment ? yet fortune oft
New loves are sweet as those that went before :
Where green old trees their branches waved ,
Of heroes , saw him like a thriving plant
But awful silence followed . then a hand ,
Tired hands will lay the folded magic by .
Coaches drove up , pages sprang down ,
Yet truth can tell my heart is hers
And not a mask went unimproved away :
Spring 's offerings at my feet to lay ;
The threat ' ning lights he bore away ,
Your soul lay open to my view ,
Tell who gavest thee thine evil !
And ere the seasons round their brief career
Who 'll pass her memory by .
His course intended ; else how had the world
I bring my tears to you as wine .
Of palm that fell like fountains over cliffs
That beats within the virgin veins of spring , --
Herself with this the long procession leads ;
Such as quarrel , and give slaps --
An humble suppliant should be seen ,
To step with into light and joy ;
All joys lie waiting on his winding stair ;
Than hidden brooks that murmur in the dusk ,
The militant angels , whose sabres drive home
Whose eyes explored yon starry field ?
Still your service to him full warrant gave .
So far the poet read his pleasing strain ,
Comes the christ-child clad in white
Her thousand impulses , like torches , coursed
Four years ! -- and didst thou stay above
In a sob and a smothered moan ,
The smiles , that follow shine more brightly .
Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
He fell in love with the chickadee ,
I will give a just decision .
Nights , whose feet flash with dew ,
But from which they now bring sad faces away ,
How sweet to mark the pouting vine ,
But the distance did not widen
Drawing its filth as doth an evil soul
Albeit the sum is seen to bide the same ,
Love the cold , dead hands that bore it ,
Tend the game of thy dominions .
Wan as primroses gather 'd at midnight
To meet thy kiss at morning hours ?
But what just before him lay ,
If the goblet made thee suffer ,
And checker 'd shadows dance upon the flood ;
' who blood and plunder for their trade pursued .
To cut the rooted causes where they hold ,
With larger sums at diff'rent seasons brought ,
The throbs of hopeless anguish to control ,
Which made them every one suspect
Full work secured , yet liabilities
In this beauty speaks to me :
Of mightiest grief may wear a heavenly hue .
-- but here the lay made sudden stand ,
His voice is cheery , his heart expands ,
When infidelity stands lowering here ,
Now ran the river calm and clear
From wave to angrier wave that sought her wreck ?
Her feet disperse the powdery snow ,
Still pass , and still i scatter flowers frail ,
And where their smiles have rested there came forth
Above the black tempest his radiance is pouring
Holds close where all the south lets go .
Beheld i issue forth a fire so happy
And mute and rapt attention held
And the dread verge still gains upon your sight :
_ and when the evening came he fell asleep ,
For he who " bore in grief a part "
Of paradise by might of waves be moved
Has hector tinged with blood of victims slain ?
Shadowing downward came dusky evening ,
Though dynasties pass .
Sadly my heart one comfort keeps ,
There moves what seems a fiery spark , --
Would put an elephant in passion .
Peers of the gods , my steps shall guide ,
Muffled sounds rose hoarsely on the night ,
Life was in him so passing beautiful !
White faces seemed to peer .
And one through fear to reverence grown .
The radiant spoils to sacred ilion bore .
As putting thunder-questions without cloud ,
Must rise with hope and sink with fear ,
Pale stands the monarch , lost in cold dismay ,
And happiness too swiftly flies ?
Take thou comfort . we will fairly
There 's a light passed from you ,
On the hill the daisies springing ,
With a charmed life you passed before us ,
Dim in the parlor 's gloom it showed ,
The strong life that never knows harness ;
Whose fate inquiring through the world we rove ;
It trails with royal rhythm its broad verses ,
Never lose heart , but baffled the straight blows
Thus went she lowly , making a soft prayer ,
And wondrous lyrics , felt but never sung ,
And reson torneth into rage ,
Then , issuing forth one foamy wave ,
There with him to offer battle ;
So vile a price no gentle heart can gain :
Who cheer his steps and ease his heavy load .
Shifting her side , short respite seeks from pain .
Were framed to cheer dark winter 's lonely hours .
Of solomon he led by fraud to build
On me old time has marked his flight --
Thus would it say -- by sad experience taught ,
Is left to hold his solitary state .
I had not marked the plot he laid .
Taking love for her chief pleasure :
A bishop came
Like young pigs whipt to make them tender .
Fear holds dominion over mortality
When the sweatin ' troop-train lay
With my mother keeping time for me ,
Because his very presence made them grave .
Brings sadness to my heart .
Reaching at length that light , i saw --
At oor grand game should bear the bell !
Till the dark clouds fled before the sun ,
Can find place in the providence of god ,
The burden of woe that his spirit was breaking ;
Locked in its arms some treasure ,
Nor show your georgian ignorance -- for shame ! '
That salted the sweet of her kiss ;
With tears o'er hapless favorites shed ,
With anxious looks some kept the score ,
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
Just in the niche he was ordained to fill .
Had it brought my son beloved ,
Hearts that own the heaven of love ?
While others still their meshes spread
To thy brief bound , and oft-returning chime
It breathed his last farewell ! the sword
And where no wants , no wishes can remain ,
To find my heart 's delight !
And they fell to battle on a day ;
And kings the forehead on his threshold drew --
They fled to bliss or woe !
Which tears of agony was bathed in :
Which comes athwart my destiny
Could raise a coin , though it took their last
A memory of easy days gone past ,
The tear forgot as soon as shed ,
The night that flies no more returns :
As through the wood her clear tones rang ,
Since every sound moves memories ,
Or barren praises pay the wounds of war .
They shall lead a life of endless glory :
But froward fortune still to follow mee ,
They help it to forget .
And below roared a brook hidden in trees ,
It is folly to fight with the infinite ,
And love , that once such bright songs gave ,
He plunged thro ' the last rich light .
Do you dream some day to fill the sea ?
The shadows gather ... what comes after
I did not know what life meant till i felt
And whatsoever wealth he could convey
And our malice goes out with the star ,
She brings me blessings of maternal love ;
Winds came howling from the south-west ,
Nor braids of gold the varied tresses bind ,
Her musket shattered the moonlight ,
Sun-smitten alps before me lay .
These bore the dear departed .
Such word alone were fit for only thee ,
Late to bloom , or soon to fade ,
And feel a loss not ages can repair . "
Who made it his study to banish our fears :
And sweet words soothed the mourner ’s heart ,
In fear some newly loosened truth might break
Song brings us union , while gently beguiling
One dim retreat a flickering torch betrayed ,
That clothed the valley with clouds of fear
That beats alone for glory , and for art .
As something superior , one must repine ,
And i followed a path that a stream had drawn
From rainbow clouds there flow not
For naught that sets one heart at ease ,
O blissful mouth which breathed the mournful breath
And leave the poet 's craft to men !
Triumphal with triumphal act have met ,
With fires that nothing can quench or tame .
These are the things which make you know .
The picket levelled his piece to shoot .
Of frowning tyranny or death 's dark face .
Flying southward clamored hoarsely ,
Ida 's long ridges sighed , sobbed clamorous streams
And bright the sunshine streamed in there ,
But they themselves jove change , we see ,
A bubble of pale fire it flew
Deucalion once with hopeless fury burned ,
From which the life-blood , flowing ,
And when the granite road of anguish mounts
Eyes that seemed to ask a question ,
Glad thoughts and birds take flower and flight ,
I took it as a gift that buddha sent
So from his lips his words and speeches fell ,
The brook crept silent to our feet ;
Will never doubt you , for the world believes you
Blinded by clouds the sky sinks .
The october night comes down ; returning as before
Who thus his friendly speech renewed :
Entering where aldus might have fixed his throne ,
And brush her azure mantle , which shall swim
Still sought it , for their destiny prevail 'd .
They saw their wealthy rulers get : --
The maid , whose virtuous ring assured her sight :
A bitter cup each life must drain ,
Round the lake light music stole ;
Where different talents find their different marts ;
Whoever flees , and unto him that shows
Out they burst with their singing ,
Then meriones shot forth a deadly shaft ,
And rent apart my scoffing heart , --
Breasts that a sighing world inspire ,
To give me light to see her face ,
Æneas rousing as the foe came on ,
A conscious slumber seems to take ,
Lust am fallen down to raking
And for that glorious home it longs .
Truth still is truth and is not vexed ;
Why not join the firm and share it ?
Cast his eyes upon the sunrise ,
Lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air ,
There shines the face i have not seen ,
In icy silence leaves desire congealed .
When from their chain its wild wings go ,
And still the maid went slow and sad ,
One lonely day -- another came in sadness ;
And there the sons of virtue laid
Like unto that which minos ' daughter made ,
Which grew in suffering , when it overspread
The wild king flushed with pride and shame ,
Thy lily-white body filleth me
And fiercely for their freedom make .
This oak will shift its roots before i budge
Then came a calmer mood , and far away
From that relation which you share ,
I would not make thy pleasure less ;
The various planets in their orbits roll 'd :
For the structure that we raise ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Julia was -- yet i never could see why --
Sins , as the seas , about me surged --
He gathered round himself the pressing tide .
Of sweet came sour , of day came night ,
Why do you put me to shame with a look
Forfeits that glory should outlive his dust ;
Then i found three words were wanting ,
For he lavisheth gifts that seldom fail ,
His trusty bow he bent and plied ,
The lake grew proud and claimed each star
Come the undying thoughts i bear ?
The bending body of my active sire ;
Famed sages lighted up the pagan world ;
And give thy soul to mirth and jollity .
The gentle moon , smiling amid the wreck
That sing to greet the day , my love ,
" no mortal face such beauty could supply ? "
And now a meteor draws a lilac line
But there surged to me instead --
" time takes the third bar off for him ,
Far away he drove the anguish ,
That bharat on the throne be set ,
To bring all things into confusion ,
As dawn shows day while seas lie chill ,
A frightened glance turns to her drowsy grandmother ,
No outlet found ; the grecian elders then
Poor law a law was passed about this date
And the swiftly circling years can ne'er erase
That through the marble met my kiss ?
" no warning given ! unceremonious fate !
Flowers beaten by the rain ,
Then again silence reigned ,
And by her pangs these resolute ghosts are stirred .
" twice i essayed to pass .
And heroes are but made for bards to sing ,
They bind the victim to the statue 's base ,
In true repentance spent will be
And without word , a sign her finger drew on
That makes her heart ache with this hungry pain ,
That honor might duly be given .
As that his will man shows .
Whereon no human mercies fall ;
Thy features fixed with suffering , the dry lips ,
Thy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won .
To humbled force the chivalry of thought .
For stubborn frost still lay upon the land ,
I will not bring thee grief or care .
And terence left his latest rhyme
It lies beneath -- my time has come at last
How to fame to ascend ?
And wade in liberty ?
The violets made a field one mass of blue --
Benign , and of our merit take no count .
The waves stretch their phosphorescent arms
That i might catch that smile divine ;
Much i owe to the land that grew --
The pallid waves caress the paler sand ,
Which finds no natural outlet , no relief ,
And draw temerity from hearts that cower .
Now autumn closes on the fading year ,
Wild unrest , like that which cometh
As quick a growth to meet decay ,
Where freedom holds her sacred standard high ,
That on the throne of pleasure hold their reigns .
Where the other dares not lend his eye ;
Her golden brooch such birth betrayed .
This their saddened song and echo :
You never know when war may come ,
They quicken to a timely glow ,
Than of thyself , thou -- rather than apply
Health is failing , wish you 'd die --
This through the gardens leads its streams around
That thou art made a child for wondering .
And with the blessing seen is satisfied .
Its tearing noise so terribly did shrill ,
With leaps of fire sprung
The silent blow fell .
In at each mouth the spirits pass ,
The midnight brought the signal sound of strife ,
Strength i have borrowed from the outward show
Shall round their spreading fame be wreathed ,
Then one her gladsome face did bring ,
But by the time the dewless meads reveal
And all the graces , linked with love ,
Join the triumph of the skies ,
Spoke no word , but shouting tossed up
And moves the sorrows to enhance the joys .
She gave the sense of smouldering fire .
As made the governor hold his breath ;
Would i had fallen upon those happier days
You need not put on sorrowing faces ;
And the winter comes to stay ! "
Two hours passed , then a dim lightening came .
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
Gave at my order what the wars denied .
The bee will make its bloom a bed ,
And the times , shaken by tumultuous war ,
In crushing down the prussian . for i knew
It cries , " beyond lies god ! " ~
Of hurt , though tongue and lip were bound .
I follow tao -- the seasons are my friends ;
Fairer than that which ruled thy temporal birth ,
Put life and mettle in their heels .
Where once the river ran .
Which even will shakespeare only found at last
Such fulness of delight the list ' ner feels .
Which indicates the mind within ,
Twice hath the windy summer made a noise
And in the balance lays their fates , to try
Nor feel the latter kisses like the first .
Again , sleep follows after food , because
And in sweet peace his spirit softly fled .
But those were the letters that lived for years .
Their prayers perform ’d the chiefs the rite pursue ,
Athwart the law he stood for sovereign sway .
Thieves dread the searching eye of power
The word i gave you i 'll fulfil ;
As it came , unsought , uncherished ,
Confusion on thy banners wait ;
He dropped his position , his algebra and all .
Mist hangs still on every hill ,
His death at least we both can share . "
That honour too wherein she holds him -- this ,
Could you make it whole by crying
And half regret , that , finding fortune fail ,
And joined my company . she took my hand
That came from the heart of a saint ,
My heart 's turned back to dixie
Right the wronged , and raise the weak .
Where three great rocks rise bleak and bare
Those are our children 's songs that come
And every heart leaps up in singing fire .
And whistling , called the wind that hardly curled
Of this i bear from day to day ,
Ere ye give heed to the rash partisan .
I break that which she made with you ,
Will bring the sport we hold so dear .
This very day , now a year is run .
Simply smiling , as i see ,
Winter was gone ; the myriad shoots of green
And on the foremost seats their places took .
Simple simon went a-fishing ,
To give assault against that fort in vain ,
Grand structure soon will take its place .
That spun the thread of life , give heed :
Who all things made but for a purpose wise ?
Thy presence fills my solitude ;
Old days come back to memory ;
Give the vengeance due
One equal course how guilt and greatness ran .
Wilt thou , monimia , shed a gracious tear
Back fell the trojans from before the face
I cast my last looks up the sky ,
" how will come to an end
And the slow spring came back .
Blackened wreaths of smoke came rising
Fair february came ,
With me to share your pride ,
No man can ease the cross i bear ! --
A moment staied the fairy there ;
That can make him glad !
For every man this tale hath told
That thou make no denial of awaiting
To catch the summer breeze .
And her lips drawn with terror at the cry
And set lord beichan once more free .
Unthinking as they onward go ,
The banner which a soldier bore ,
A century lonely hast thou stood
Had blotted all earthly fortune from my memory .
Aeneas hurled his spear ; it found the waist
What guilty hand this sacrilege had wrought ,
Which time has saved from ancient days .
But secret unseen threads went floating out :
With dreary dogmas , or rites priest given .
And his longing , still withheld !
Where the jaws of death stand open ,
Luck 's turned a bit with me of late ,
His car which tawny coursers drew ,
Some reason to suppose that moon may roll
Who made my acquaintance while painting the town :
As they take their fearful flight .
What those tartars had determined to reveal .
To the light that holds the days ;
The fragile leaves which on those warm lips blush ;
They pass , the rapture and the grace
Purged not from her veins the warm aztec
" waking i found my weary night a dream ;
The blue hills melting into gray ,
A bitter sigh i drew , then scarce found voice
From want of money , heaven defend !
Under their colors stand displayed :
That lay in the house that jack built .
Wealth sought and kings adventured life to hold .
There , soft extended , to the murmuring sound
Eat of this fruit and quench your thirst . ”
The blood of christ does their stains remove ;
Here grows lavender , here breathes england .
The silver lamp ; the fiery spirits blaze :
Gives the loud signal , and the heavens reply .
Headlong , impetuous , see it pour :
And the blood burned in each heart beating there ;
Therefore make haste and come along with me ,
For their power from his must spring .
White souls whose beauty made their world divine :
( small wonder that my footsteps went astray ! )
Red of heat , its shape has passed .
From the hope to which passion had clung .
His pity gave ere charity began .
Here runs the highway to the town ;
Making the gloomiest day worth while !
From valleys where her slumbering fathers lie ;
There hateful envy her own snakes shall feel ,
She drinks in all his words with ecstasy .
And not to fall asleep .
The angry north to wage his warres .
Wherefore then comes thine annoyance ,
The brave meets danger , and the coward flies .
The english army that oppos ’d alone .
False are the smiles i see ,
Soar up to seek the sky .
Their shouts rolled to the rafters ,
Which in thy bosom make so hot impression ;
The winter rose must blow , the sun put on
And silence follow 'd , and we wept .
Let the wretch go festering through florence ) --
And his eyes i turned to north-west ,
One while the little foot-page went ,
For which the human race keep such a coil !
A plot to ruin her , which has succeeded .
A king might wish to hold in fee .
The throats that twitter , the wings that beat ;
The song , whose gentle voice was given
And fill 'd her life with day .
Mourns less for what age takes away
That follow 'd him day and night :
" my heart has flown to join thee , "
To save the athenian walls from ruin bare .
In a great spasm of passion mixed with pain ;
He looks through life and only sees its end !
They made an uproar in the meeting-house
She redresses every wrong . "
In heavenly might secure ;
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
And made it sluggish as old acheron .
To bible teaching , they might share the fate
Once more , and truth before them fled away .
Which made me both to weep and smile ;
Round the bright board where darkling centuries wait ,
But they feel the sword of hodeirah ,
The rain and dew never stay dry .
Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang .
And takes no thought how wind and rain by fits
And mike he slacked that grip o ' his
Who tried all things in courage , staked her heart
But when this alma bell affair came up ,
The gourd is tagged with points of fog .
The bit that goes for christ
Had given unknown the subtle powers that wake
Let the war go rolling on alone for awhile ,
Which credit gives him upon sight :
What act designed our freedom to defend ,
These it had been your lot to bear ,
Till in one common carnage heap 'd we lay .
Why , buried hopes are dismal things ,
Then nigher drew the sound of footsteps light
O'er karl the flood of sorrow swept ;
And the whole matter rests upon eyesight .
But the memory brought her only bitter grief ,
He looks through life and only sees its end !
His worth , like health or air , could find
These charms shall work thy soul 's eternal health ,
There for a year his visit paid :
And always , always , with each soul that comes
Where the wood-grape 's clusters shine :
Could we stand with that old moses
Whose forests deepen and whose moon goes down ,
When the eastern conduits ran with wine ;
Long through the hills their way they took ,
And the first and the third may go unscathed ,
And wrings a blessing out from tears
So fierce he ramped and reared ,
And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set ;
Angry words soon turned to blows ;
Fresh currents through my frozen pulses run ;
Dreams of the dead years gone astray ,
To spare its innocence ?
They two must sin to keep their vows .
The shore i long to gain ;
And gave a friendly invitation ,
Pass measure of excess , and war is cain ,
Cried all , " before such things can come ,
Life goes by like a rushing river --
But a fleece to shield him from the cold :
Old ocean hides , their daring sails they spread ,
Till notes of triumph bursting round
Come , for you left me taking no farewell ,
Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm ;
To gain one little moment of delight .
Bearing miasma in its scorching breath ,
Thou hast arranged wisely the whole concern ,
" then added , how into the gallery came
No blood would i shed ,
Its freshness and coolness thou equally shared ' st ;
Since our poor prayers yet reach thee , lord ,
That has passed over : so this may depart !
With joy descending on the cretan shore .
Although in following the promptings of their nature
Curses on my tongue they shower ,
The bounty of the grandeur there contained ,
So wide a vision made there
And summer win thee to forget
Drake gave the word , and with one crimson flash
Can scarce our _ english _ awkwardness endure .
And caught their subtle odors in the spring ?
And to the sea the timber drew .
Are rare . with this distinction take my words ;
And bursts of laughter shook the flood .
And robins fill the air with sweetest sound ;
Let fall a word of hope and love ,
That brought the fog and mist .
They caught the jury with that argument ,
Than with eight wounds fell my love to earth .
Tam did na mind the storm a whistle .
Their native air , nor take a foreign law !
Like some green fabric , shot with myriad hues ,
The music stopped and i stood still ,
And scorching with its heat the grass !
And with a flame that rose up silently
From rose to red the level heaven burned ;
And the bridges often go .
But this i know , and this i feel ,
Let the wretch go festering through florence ) --
The death-charged bullets fly ,
A glimpse i caught of that abode , by thee
Ye storms , that round the dawning east assembled ,
Nor shame thine eyes subdued .
On which my endless tears were bootless spent ,
That man through them might his redemption find .
While him apollo thus lured to the chase
So may the soul that warmed it rise !
The maid gave chase , the lambkin ran ,
His breath he could not draw !
A life that can not last me long . '
And watch 'd the wild waves rush on ,
Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows ;
With joy they did pursue their themes ,
And thus lay alison and nicholas ,
Around his neck their longing arms they cast ,
Rebellion rising , saw in whom , how spred
More strong and strong her terrors rose ; --
How does this boldness come , that you would be
And makes it calm and tranquil as thy own .
And found our glory after mortal pain ;
Within my heart wilt hold thy station .
To make inquiry of the nation 's wealth ,
Or with them any discord bring ,
Reverent he made in me my knees and brow ;
Take thirty winters from my frame ?
And it told to a little sleeping child
Where the veiled demon held his feast accurst ,
To joy in peace the conquests thou hast got ,
Where human foresight fails , the dire intent ,
A knave , who foolishly has lost
That to marry the couple he felt inclined .
Through western skies his course have run ,
There came -- not great disasters which might crush
The sunlight draws them to its love ;
Thy bharat to his presence bring .
The year your cares that 's fled and gone .
I will be bound to make it plain
Quick deaths that grow
Have caught the altar with a flickering flame ,
Words may not paint our grief for thee ,
And storms and years have worn and reft
In mournful cadences , that come abroad ,
In agony ; even as pity seems to wear
Melted the snow and warmed the sky ,
Where dies the border more than half away .
Heavy with death unto the ground , yet made
Who formed this frame with beneficent aim ,
Where only merit constant pay receives ,
Thir deities to assert , who while they feel
' evil only comes from evil ,
And seems to wish to reach the sky .
Shalt thou give law to god , shalt thou dispute
The mighty realm that earth and sea contained ,
Thy creature , whom i found so fair .
Of grace hath come , without baptismal rites
The western garden lay lonely under the hill .
To buy all else that the world can show
For fashion or for warmth his pate , goes forth
That views his bright home , and desires
Shall human eyes alone dissolve in tears ?
Of yore the gods and demons made .
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew ,
And a hush sinks down o'er the weary town
Nor yet alone , beloved , shall we see
Who scribble stuff to meet the public need .
As tell a youthful heart , by anguish torn ,
To me revolving with the eternal twins ,
There live the memories of my early days ,
And gives the consuls royal robes to wear .
The awed loch lay black and still
Or whether we shall lose the precious time ,
Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish 'd me ;
Then , grant we that sejanus went astray
Next broke with jocund laughter in ,
Needing another stoker , being homeward bound .
Of sorrow to come with a coming day ?
Concludes the soldier 's final story .
That lay in the house that jack built .
And make the law a friend to peace :
My silent thoughts are echoing from these shells ;
The frenzy left her and she speechless fell .
To whom all eyes are turned in expectation .
And godlike labours on the surface rose .
And glories shall bring .
For they who would find peace must conquer fear
Thy beauty holds the spell that wakes to life
Shall bind my heart for evermair ,
For giving love and getting love of thee -
Follow the desultory feet of death ?
Those thoughts that wander through eternity ,
May make the copy , justly pass for yours .
To speak and childlike tell of something fine
Her heart was troubled yet comforted ,
On chaliced flowers that lies ;
But there is something moving in my heart
For his strength allied to goodness .
For though not given to weakness , he could feel
That this cup of grief might pass me ,
I press to bear no haughty sway ;
But kept its secrets . wild birds flew
While every breath of eve that chanced to blow ,
This lusti folk , that make it gay ,
Into stone had changed their waters .
Shall singing swans bear upward to the stars . "
All the day 's brightness gone ,
You know that i have got no power ;
My soul returned to haunt me again .
To bless the tomb that wraps thy clay ;
Backward i turn my course to learn
Dismal and low its accents came ,
A reckless fire which struggled for a vent ) .
And distant pastures send the bleat
The trees are trooping hither to assail
To what the number of the flock may mount .
How this withering heart would burn ,
With far reflections -- as the stars suggest
The figure which the spirit lost , its skin
That wakes the love of beauty in the soul ;
They give good gold in babylon ! "
To tell me the stocks could not rise .
Loved and made the world his lover ,
And illness , too , its miseries combined .
Light have ye still to follow evil or good ,
Anon from heaven a sad reverse he feels :
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat !
Thy sword kills not our pledges ; civil war
The ticking clock , which told the hour ,
Will the green hills lift up their sunny heads ,
A lullaby that i have made to croon
Deep in the woody wilderness , and gave
More hatred from leander did not suffer
Of a dream that comes to me ,
That hand which royalty has shaken
The hands of holy promise , finds a throng
In large white flakes falling on the city brown ,
No laughing throng , no lover goes ;
That pushed down into the common loam
And conquest shifting to the trojan side ,
And spread its joys around .
On which the gathered horror hung ;
Yet not the less did suffering nature feel
With joy from out the hollow wood they bound ;
First enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls
Like a flame went soaring straight
Phoenicians battling with the sea brought me
Naught gives such pleasure to our sight ,
Roar as they fill with rushing floods , and howls
And on the foe his fury turned .
And put an end unto your joyous life ,
When joyous harp did there resound
Stands for divinity -- sounds much the same --
Not for the fortunes at your fair feet hurled .
No conflict in himself is felt ,
And all alone went she .
That rest or intermission none i find .
No gentler sorrow falls on all than this .
Being happy ; and the cliffs took up her cry
How they point to the persian abodes ,
If the red-eyed lantern made no sign ,
Behold what blessings wealth to life can lend !
That sets all ears on fire .
Was tied to rosy 's triumphal car ,
And eyes with tears are aching .
That in youth used to favor him so .
This evil came on william at the first .
For unto both abruptly came the hour
No star that kindles in the sky
But i , with naught to lend relief ,
Where sunbeams play , where shadows darken ,
The dry bush leapt into flame ; --
Who ride the hurricanes of fire that roll
For kisses which i gave for love : how cursed
In summer 's lap with flowers to lie .
A passion as that which kindles you . "
The servant , who hath joyful tidings brought ,
Now with the almost finished task make haste .
Where voices of children once merrily rang ;
Three pines strained darkly , runners in a race
A glass , earth ’s mysteries to unfold ,
It comes first with the stream , and goes
Too late betrayed the cloven hoof .
Which his old master pointed out to him ,
Or makes exchange of hats with friends .
Who formed this frame with beneficent aim ,
Which sends , and swallows up ; treasure of worlds
The cross she brings , nor doubts its shining pure
With strength given to endure .
On this strong ground he took his stand ,
A weather-beaten wanderer sad and worn ;
To weave the dance that measures the years ;
Against the trojan warriors burned in wrath .
The dark fields wait to take the harvest in .
Whose singing can make thee eternally blest ?
And make the soul as bright as they :
Just how he tapped his brogue , and twitched
Her rippling laughter floated through the room ,
To seek excuse , but make them few ,
But , softer than the summer rain is shed ,
The light in a thin blue veil peered sick ;
Though dread eternity has sown her seeds
There came an angel shape and offered me
When teague soon felt a secret wish to roam :
Thee the third day shall to a hostel bring ,
The wise men traced their guided way ;
Fills the hush with wonder there .
Were squared and raised to the power of ten ,
When a voice rang sadly through my soul ,
Thirty years have come and gone ,
A bulwark that no foe can break .
Where her great brother gave the grecians aid .
The great reform act doth appear .
That love which lifts the heart , yet leaves
Time here can never close .
The gay enchantment was undone ,
And the flame will light to heaven ,
We 'll have to cut ptolemy .
And feeds on sad misfortune 's bitterest tears ?
From imminent peril that before me stood ,
The ram goes through , an irresistible rush
His silver tresses breathe perfume ;
To pass the desert to a throne , --
And tear-drops that for pity fell ,
And rule our palace with an equal sway .
Behind , the rising earth in ridges roll ’d ;
Where all christian sects might gather ,
The scornful glittering ages wane :
And drank the morning air .
The rifted wood roars wild and dreary ,
Youth may wither , but feeling will last ;
At early nightfall cleave the air serene ,
Its fairy gait attends ;
Had set to work as briskly as their brothers :
Keeping time with skip and hop .
Lost in death their baleful light .
And crooked shapes of terror crouched ,
The flames that burn within the heart , the kisses
The young life comes , bound to the cruel rocks
Is it thy voice my spirit knows ,
To hint at a life to come .
And let me add that i intend to :
The play is done ; the curtain drops ,
Their flags to follow , and their arms prepare ;
It crept till it kissed a cheek so pale
Joy that makes all things well ,
Might well have rendered vain their faithful care
Take flight , and thou art free to roam ,
And scattered the hail with maniac zest
For days we could not catch a breeze ,
No whisper comes across the plain ,
The strong , pale faces looking upon death ,
That told of arthur ’s bitterest foe
But whispered news there came ,
And , day by day , within thy spirit grew
And the eve falls chill and murk ;
Beneath these monstrous suns that never set
While life remains to it prepared to outface
His lips that scarce remember their warmth , now
The day in marmion 's journey wore ;
A little over us his station took .
As life is copied in the form of death :
And found his promise true ; she was sustained .
Answered in the words which follow :
Not following christ , by the experience
Think hannibal did laugh when carthage lost .
The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry ;
Ah , worldwide nation , always growing sorrow !
They also have hearts that ache when stung .
Time has revealed with bitter clearness
A precious plague ; a fury sweetly drawn ;
Leading afar past wild magnificence ,
The passage lay across a straight , he came ;
The cognizance she gave me : here i dwell
Shall not be left despairing .
The ancient poet turned my steps , reflecting
To stately trees by breezes rocked :
Where hopes and fears the soul engage ;
Sudden there came a change : again i saw
But whence the sudden beam that shoots along ?
When the clock struck the hour for retiring ;
The " senate " will together come
She shines on thieves on the garden wall ,
The menial train the regal feast prepare .
And , moved by love , believed him slain .
A bright glow spread when dipping in the waves ,
And then will come the conquerer 's song .
After long time and trouble spent in vain ,
A year when nations ventured against us to combine ,
That chamber built . he framed the solid doors ,
That these lovely spirits bring ?
A general object of attention , made
A kitchen will admit of no disease .
I burn with bitter ire ,
And murky clouds veil those bewitching skies !
When clouds frown dark and cold ,
't is passing wonderful that they ,
Crimson with roman blood yon stream shall run .
That my soul it keepeth apart .
Where heroes find a haven and a rest .
O mellow lights that o'er us slide ,
For in thy womb rekindling shone the love
The house stands : love and youth
Though thou couldst turn thy rays to gold .
But sleep will not come to mine eyes .
Because they make it their delight ,
Working its own undoing !
The snow rose , the last rose
And windows glaring with a blood-red stain ,
You are my highest hope made real at last ,
In this way they screw into second-rate offices
That comes at the end of the awful thirst ;
The gods assented ; and around thee lay
By the great future 's dazzling hope made blind
Delight that lives an hour ,
And quenched the fearful weapon fell ,
The shapely limbs of venus hid from sight
God slays himself with every leaf that flies ,
Grace and shifting beauty float !
From the course the tarred boat follows .
Of black that lay on naples .
Cry , as the wild light passes along , --
Its fame o'er the whole world resounds ,
Two weeds which pose our economic catos .
A comparison of the two stories shows some differences .
In silence reposed the voluptuous bee ;
But got thereby his death wound bloody .
And london now it justly claims
Now not a joy has life to give ,
Thy flesh was tempered . behold in thy body
Put life and mettle in their heels .
Set the standard of god on high ;
't was well enough when summer came ,
Beneath the sky that burning august gives .
So let extend thy mind o'er all the world
' dying thou shalt lie in nothingness , nor of
Ingathered self that made her night .
Not coming from himself , it were more dangerous :
Virtue that bears the sacred shield of truth ?
And while with fond attention shown ,
That only serves to make us grieve
Forth into the village went he ,
Of the evening coming soon .
When an immortal passion breathes in mortal clay ;
Hast wrought an act of sin and shame ,
There came a dream so fair ,
Shall i bring these songs together
Be content to yield your sway .
Day passed ; the shades of night drew on ,
Yet meet my flames ! and thou shalt see
Which lit her lifted brow . )
Like thunder clouds that spake to babylon ,
Land of the lotus , fallen from the sun ,
Think now upon your grievous things to bear , --
The vision of it watered thirst .
No certain news if like the rest it run .
Rivals they were , to different faith were bred .
The restless heart forgets to crave the moon !
But that which most his courage stirred hath ,
The war is felt on high ; the nodding crown
In visions deep , when filled with holy awe ,
The throne his fathers held from age to age ,
Albeit the wind blew fair for their intent ,
And apes in westminster give judgment and sentence ,
Balmy night appears , by sweet love followed ;
Easily got , and held in light esteem .
Then the good minute goes .
My soul intent allows no other thought
At first the silent lips made no reply ,
And joyful feelings rose which she could scarce control .
Tired i was ; my head would go
Invisible to mortals , we may see .
Who gave us all untimely birth ,
Within the crystal , which records the name ,
And into an unhappy sleep she fell .
I take in penance of my bitter sins .
Or prove from scripture what it never meant ,
But we are pressed by heavy laws ;
Thy sweetness scatters sweetness everywhere ,
Some are an offered prey that passions take .
The roses are resting upon her brown cheeks --
Victory crowns the just .
To quench the fire of anguish in some eye
The finest language can but faintly tell ,
That takes you now ? night wraps itself around
But she leaped a shape of light ,
And over his dead face fell fast her tears .
Whene'er a noble deed is wrought ,
As deeply rooted in a soil of love ;
That slew our sorrow and healed our care . "
And lend to the rhyme of the poet
In front deep ebro rolls its mighty waves :
That all shall know achilles swells the tide . "
Pondered deeply and reflected ,
Shall find his avarice there and cowardice ;
Saw the smoke arise to heaven ,
And neptune holds a mirror to their charms .
Great shadows stretched along the rocks ,
To all he felt a father 's love ,
Thee i beheld , upon that highway drawn ,
What weakness see not children in their sires ?
A party to have made thee by thyself .
His voice rang strong and true :
Shall lead thee to thy grave .
The nightingales made vocal
The works the wizard time has wrought !
Upon this poured its radiant warmth pervading
Can have of beauty . you will see it bend
Parted , alas ! i carry from its source ,
For the apparel oft proclaims the man .
That stands in place secure ;
Such future scenes the all-righteous powers display
No verse had shown the poet half so well
Lost in effect , while science seeks the cause .
Of a race runs not for ever ,
I know what their white lips would say ;
When you shall read the testimony given
Till his pain the gray-beard banished ,
A chance but chance may lead where i may meet
Already budding in this pact of peace ,
Upon the vanquished knight no blame shall fall ,
That , whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain ,
The petals waned paler , and shriveled ,
What wisdom in their needles stirs ?
Know by the thread of music woven through
It makes you overlook there are two hours :
Touch the notes of joy and pleasure .
To make your merry blood run slow !
That grieved and doubted , it came to pass
For the love i bear to thee .
Stands the revelation of his love .
To attach blame elsewhere ,
The name , that springs forever in my breast .
Thy love 's constraint i feel ,
Thy soul walks now beside thy beatrice ;
My head unturned lest my dream should fade .
And leaps from dreams to hail the coming day .
Where mighty saints have led :
And sun leans forth to his brother-sun .
The night my girl was led astray ;
Till pausing at the last her breath to take ,
His thirst in puddles laving ;
Let your heart speak , minnehaha ! "
With white wings beating flitter-flutter ,
The wood 's a subdued power gentle as
To feel as cool as a strawberry ice
Such , if on high their thoughts are set ,
The purple blazes , and the gold stripes shine ;
In leaving verse more free from the restriction
" make room , make room for a faithful heart
On deathless glories fix thine ardent view :
Thus forced reluctant to the fight anew ;
Teeth clenched as visors where the fierce eyes made
Praise him who sendeth joy and woe .
A flame all undefiled though it tremble ;
As flame can rise anew from unseen fire ?
Drawing his dagger which he ever bore
" and may the pox devouring make thee smart ;
When fall those locks that on thy shoulders play ,
Because the law compelled it . took this time
The sense they humbly take upon content
An absent hero 's wealth they made their spoil ;
Faith tottered ; thousands saw their gain in war .
For the spent waves of the symphony of freedom
No ! even now , my glance prophetic sees
If you repent not he will bring you low !
But safe in southern , gave the fleet repose ,
Of her a gift , a task that tires :
O simple spirit , guided from above ,
Is in high heaven pierced with darts of gold .
No , let him search his heart , secure
Who gave for thee his noble life .
What hours had flown .
And what is it gars her greet .
All space would ring and echo with my rhyme .
Had left the job and was following his carriage .
To sanctify the vow i make .
The storm of hissing javelins pours behind .
Deeply shares the general gloom ,
And to grim weapons stretched their eager hands .
Had given a tone of prophecy .
Where the hot road dust made grey thy feet ?
Wrapped forms that moved as melodies move ,
By fits the sun 's departing beam
It came from the heaving breast of the deep ,
Than join those old thin voices with my new ,
Our intellect is to such depth absorb 'd ,
Fine feathers do not always make fine birds .
And a great cry rang round the sky
The surface upwards left the depths unmoved .
The hunger of the years is stilled ; no pain
Sped the boat and made good progress ,
I bore the cross thro ' pain and loss ,
“ nay , through thy might each queen will share
And froze the genial current of the soul .
To waste and pierce me with its maddening goad ?
Poor mamma 's baby allows her no rest ,
The moonbeams trail their shrouds ;
Patroclus , give the gods their honours due :
Or from the clouds their blended chorus sent ,
Ask what a face belonged to this high fame ,
Unerringly where her love for me led --
Be all thy life in music given ,
The train that ran till it ceased to pay ,
The beaded usqueba with sugar dashed .
To leave the haunts of men
For in thy womb rekindling shone the love
Along the path which , stretching through the years ,
And long had fed his youthful appetite ;
O race of humankind , take shame !
I 'm up . go on .
But they who master allah 's mysteries ,
Her happiness , however near it stands .
Has drawn the terrible lightning from its cloud ,
From whom the answer came unto these words ,
Here johan 's unsteady laugh rang out once more .
And to his crew , that sat consulting , brought
It hurries all too fast to mark their way :
But wealth without beauty _ makes _ fair ;
Which beat at his call when france arose
Another 's wealth on his to lay ,
And makes us rather bear the graves we have
Hath swept at last the shadow from her brow
I am so sunk in solitude , so wrapped
On both our armies hath this turmoil brought
The house would _ not _ fall in !
Below me drifts the shimmering light --
Then to consult on farther methods went ,
But shame in me his menaces produced ,
With blindness linked , did on my vitals fall ;
With startled faces . voices rose and fell ,
Happy is life as the long days go by .
Shout ! let it reach the startled huns !
That daily they would follow :
That graced the sable strath with green ,
Is now returning which a while was gone . '
Their day of liberty for ever set .
Fast to the spot , such root she took ,
Decide not rashly . the decision made
Only , their words like music seem to play ;
Than ever yet in court was served by liege ,
Impatience , soon , their faces tell
Eager steps that were coming .
Ached with the dreary void lost love had made ,
While the limpid shadows slip
Beneath his tread his way he took ,
Less doubtful , as that worthy shade complied .
There shone one woman , and none but she .
To ease the heart of its human ache ! --
Soon as my soul had outwardly returned
The pastor made to him one more appeal ,
Between them they will lay this farm as smooth !
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss .
On the plain will the trumpets join chorus ,
Who laid that home in ashes , he endured
For breaking heart or broken spirit .
So art thou broken in upon me , apollo ,
Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy ;
And all with as much ease might taken be ,
Rose -- where thought rises when it follows death !
And all his beating bosom claim ’d the fight .
No tree could ever bear them twice ;
But for the issue of the fight attend ,
A poisonous mist , touched by the wrath of god
To our dark world thy shining page is shown ,
As much in value as it wants in weight .
At last they found that they were cheated .
And down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears .
On their shoulders held the sky .
Well " posted " in theology ,
As is the circle that around it turns .
For the stern pass that draws it to itself .
The mystery did explain .
While the river flows to meet the sea !
Into the shape she breathed a flame to light
And there had sunk his golden crest .
Seems to add summer to the wilderness .
For the old jealousy in the marble lives .
Birth comes with travail ; all these woes
Another half-score milestone passed , and then
So , through the thunder comes a human voice
Does the self-same weary thing take place ?
Smiles chase tears away to-morrow .
The clouds suffuse with leaping light the lands ,
For joy of one wild demon burst ere quelled ,
The traces of the chariot showed ,
That no more , whirlwind , follows thee .
Even then , sharp lightning quivered thro ' the gloom
No pledge can hold , no promise bind ?
Found ready ; but what greek would stand to see
The wild confusion struck with fear
Ideal made real past all reality !
She gave you all that madness could propose ,
Who sees the error which he can not right ;
To an impossible thing , which needs compel
Of fifteen steps he made but three ,
Or raging fire had o’er it passed .
Mourns less for what age takes away
Softly with music his wife led him in
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain ,
Serpentine stood by chance before the two ,
And desolation rages all around .
Years of unbroken victories balanced down
Yet , by unconscious fascination led ,
And that deep vow , which brutus made before ,
The third said it was a house ,
Of genius still divides itself from yours :
And suddenly there came , as a great joy ,
Still sadly to my memory rushes ,
There the strength of the heathen lies .
And all the air a solemn stillness holds ;
The cold black fear is clutching me to-night
White faces seemed to peer .
Still of preferment let her shine the queen ,
O impious act , including all foul harms !
Who had no voice nor vote in making laws ,
Marvelous darkness shadow 'd o'er the place .
In the end , when you got your divorce --
But never bind a moment yet to come .
We bear the penalty for others ' shame .
And made a glory where she sate .
And growing fear .
Till into stately-gated troy they poured .
Princes are princes ; and god made the world
And loud the praise of the spinner rang .
Her face was jerked by little , nervous twitches ,
Can die , and can not change .
Of happiness to put away their trouble .
Mixed with the masque of death 's old comedy
The dawn the rosy east has kissed ;
He smiled , and thought it passing fair ;
Like lightning round the ruins it had made !
The present meets the past ,
Juno dares not give her odds :
Where the tall seaweeds rise and never stir ....
The pope he leads a happy life ,
The light of daisy 's lost love made
To hint compulsion , and secure from flight ,
With him there came forty ships .
As each sweet feature made it stay --
Eyes of my soul seeing perfection ,
Hope builds for love , -- with faith ; --
A laugh of the heart which was echoed around
Built by the hand that fashioned the old world ,
Like two rose-leaves drifted
An hour of rapture where it came to me .
On lamenting wholly set ;
What was that shadow o'er thy sunshine thrown ?
Thou art to all lost love the best ,
One hasty plunge -- it loosed its hold ,
Some dream of danger to her young hath stirred .
I took thee not for treacherous fire ,
No circumstance the voice of fame relates :
The dreamy isles that the immortals keep !
Shaking beside the brook , and grass comes green ,
And looking in his face saw anguish there
In this faith i rest secure ;
Still their new rule and council is well meant .
Should scan such secret truth ; for he had learnt
A thistle 's flashing to a woody rise ,
His utterance choked by tears that rolled
Winter had ceased in sullen ire to rive
But yet the moon-crowned night could bring
" should thy frenzy come upon thee ,
With thanks to heaven the gift i took ,
Sifting the nations ,
Of thoughts long gone .
His pattern he 'll follow , his gentleness use ,
Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view .
My boots are torn , d'ye see ;
To this dim sphere by god 's indulgence given ,
Of fashion , hails what lady proud ?
But from the clouds of earth that lie
Oft has thou bound in durance vile ,
And the dreams that keep the gates of sleep ,
No heart have i her life to take :
" lo , thou hast broken the sweet yoke
And i stopped and looked at the shifting shadows
That swelled my heart with mad delight .
All her tender limbs with terror shook .
To lay their just hands on that golden key
Here , contest grows but interchange of love ,
Where the winds can never find them ,
Huge cities for ages laid low ?
My weary fingers wandered round
And all my thirsty tissues slake .
And what do mortals in thee see ,
Her face revealing every mark of stricken woe ,
Where rugged voices cry ;
Is sober virtue seen to move her sphere .
The lights went out , save one remaining star
This want that builds the world !
Poor buonamico , shivering , crept .
Then my heart is filled with sorrow ;
" a scholarship would nicely fit him ;
While gorgeous hollyhocks sway to and fro
There they stand , to ask thee thy career :
To fold the fleet in of the winds from far
Because it was grassy and wanted wear ;
That all our joys are felt with mutual zeal ;
My self stood safe meanwhile within this town ,
And they shall come full of their tenderness ,
Then one by one the numerous laws were made ,
Th ' enormous weight from earth could hardly raise .
Like a fierce dog that takes his angry course
Whose footstep stirs the rustling grass
And back there floated in his oral ken :
Panic seizes the herds ,
According to their judgment , all suggest
The rising tumult ran .
To escape the impending famine , often scared
Spake in haste the words that follow :
So passed the sun from that fair summer day .
The far-fetch 'd diamond finds its home
I took her for some scottish muse ,
Of winning with his humor , and he went
Where nature wore her mildest grace --
Jamie telfer has gotten thirty and three .
Here michael ceased , and to the fields went forth
What throes , what tortures passing cure ,
And katherine 's hand the stocking threw ;
The sacred hush of death comes none too oft
His travel he took ,
Though hid in gray ,
That apollo gave heed to all he could say :
They never can shake my trust ;
And patriotic . buffers catch from boys
When love should ripen to maternity ,
The very thought still makes my blood to boil --
Seest thou whose step , unwilling hither bends ?
Is this the triumph ? this the promise sworn ?
To the practice of virtue he knew they were bound
Are frae their nuptial labours risen :
From battle ? " but he sinking found no rest
Wonder from whence my love of freedom sprung ,
Like ducklings to water instinctively taking ,
" but different far the course his glory took ,
A big , broad smile came to her face .
Sweet to make others ' happiness one 's own :
For finest fish they could not well go wrong ;
It does not vent its loathing , does not turn
It makes the people oft them hate ;
Now rise in marble , from the roman sway .
Within his bending sickle 's compass come ;
As the doomed darkness backward by him rolled ,
A moment 's worth of wisdom there escaped him ,
They made a grand attack ,
And watched the bubbles go
And give it utterance with that sprawling tongue ,
Just see -- they all are here . "
With flying fingers touch 'd the lyre :
The melancholy waters lie .
Love still can find the way !
Based on notes made while witnessing the fighting .
The very curls of smoke that rise
And filled the worlds with fear ,
And the moonlight fell above her ,
Sure thy bosom holds no care ;
Our lives went by together
Besotted thus , and some that bore till death ,
At noontide they flow
That made thee stoop to such a soul ,
Death ? i 'll take it laughing !
A commonness to desire that makes unchaste ;
Wished the jolly holidays came twenty times a year ,
I knew quite well my luck was gone ;
The ear which time the immortal framed for him
There honour comes , a pilgrim gray ,
They took in joy , reproach , surprise ,
Over a street where sorrow sings ;
When one sweet image dimly came .
Thine eyes shall light dark danger 's path ,
Slighting regards cast on my father 's child ,
The president rolled in splendor new ,
In gracious words his answer gave :
Year by year , like milestones placed ,
They surged about me singing of the south --
But now the cross our worthies bore
Their gentle rule next owned and shared ,
The rites , more sacred made by heavenly song ;
Of inspiration gather 'd from distress ,
Did he wear purple in the world he saved ?
That fluttered round the jasmine stems
Their beauty might declare :
Wealth sought and kings adventured life to hold .
Where song-birds made melodious chime ,
Staggering to take the pledge of brotherhood ,
Is famished -- finds no music in the song ,
The courteous speech that passed between .
But jest set down , resigned to fate ,
Of priam 's son the stormy weapon flew ,
Who hath seen joy , or who shall ever find
Be lured toward the love that yearned unseen .
The onward path pursuing still
Then from the royal tent they take their way ;
The burden that it always bore :
Are opened to admit the " lullaby "
Mind can not follow it , nor words express
And she reduced to beaky skin ,
" but even though such days endure ,
The proclamation made for may :
Where first to fix the meditated blow ;
Thus , kissing every limb they tie ,
And royalty to crack his joke , --
When tender tints have turned to gold
So fiercely leapt these sons of troy to meet
Of scripture hold supreme authority .
So quickly changing grew the maiden 's charms ,
Which he presumed had sealed my fate .
Pray , shall i tell your fortune ?
And if my dying words can move ,
What death could ever yield thee more content ?
And mark you where the ivy clings
And on my soul hung the dull weight
Well did she know sweet wiles to take
Their pale prows wander to and fro .
Where at noon-day his prayer he made
" who gives his heart to love ,
Which priests have always found to compass their abuse .
When shortly to her ears the tidings flew .
He sought to gain no learned degree ,
What light can dispel the gloom ?
From the dim landscape slowly steals away ;
To see laughter rise from tears ,
As will partly appear in this very short history .
With widening retrospect that bred despair .
The hope , the trust , the purpose stayed ,
The span allotted for his life be run .
Between their horns the salted barley threw ,
Guided a necromancer where it lay .
And all things are made young with young desires ;
And pride and power pursue the raid ,
The heavens fell , the hills were overthrown ,
Happy love is come to woo
Glimmering clouds of bloom you stand ,
And by the blessed nightingale which threw
A knock was heard that made them run .
Death comes in a day or two .
His mate wormed up the tilted yard and slashed ,
It conquers all men , like her ,
That brought them to us , have gone by .
" splendour eternal , piercing through these folds ,
The flame that lit the battle 's wreck
Which tasteful toil and hourly danger give .
't was thus his murmur 'd musings ran --
Have made a happier world for me .
Whose death had waked my pity ;
In thy childhood where flourished the city of god .
In saying this i feel that i rejoice .
And with christ take salvation .
Our souls were bathed in bliss divine ,
The midnight wind came wild and dread ,
Idly the music from thy mother caught ;
And all that raised the hero sunk the man :
With neck aside to draw in tone ,
All tangled together like dreams in the sleep
And snatch a fearful joy .
It 's leaving thee , my bonnie mary !
Her honor and truth to maintain ,
The souls in torment came ,
Their blossoms spread , great albuquerque , for thee !
" here vigor failed the towering fantasy :
Which lays both men and women on the shelf ,
Add loss to your losses and triumph for ever ;
And ek the lawe of god observed .
Black thoughts be stilled beyond recall :
The low winds moan for dead sweet years ;
Came twelve ships .
August brings the sheaves of corn ,
All our doors stand open for you ;
Proclaiming life to come :
With the deluge of summer it receives ;
For lurking dread this speech within her stirred ;
I lost my safety when i made thee great .
Who feel by reason and who give by rule ,
' twill come -- as night follows day ,
In the street a shadow lies
And melted , and the silence grieved anew .
The paths they fashioned year on year .
And i to science gave these simple facts :
( although his harem would have shocked her ) ;
The gale may whistle , the frost may come
While locks of gold had turned to grey
The trees are green still , but their branches bear
Grown calmer , stronger , mind returned , that found
I do not ask for earthly store
And in the chambers laid apparel fair ,
When the clock struck the hour for retiring ;
From nuptial kindred came the fatal blow .
Wilson 's warnings wasted , world war wild ,
The tears blinded her ee .
Who sought to make his willful lady hear
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me ,
Our eyes will close to undisturbed rest .
The great are kings wherever they are thrown .
Turns to sorrow , shame , and pain .
Outworn by more than many years gone by ,
And the fool builds again while he grumbles ,
A flood of tears gushed freely from her eyes ,
“ from gildish race if thou be sprung ,
And flattery , then to the lure they come .
These ask no love , these plight no faith ,
Men in their loose unguarded hours they take ,
Anew , this loved and scourged of angels found
While i tread this vale of tears !
She was more fair than words can say :
If wealth is gone -- then something is gone !
You go a long and lovely journey ,
Which feeds it as a mother who doth make
The land of shadows wilt thou trace ,
Sorrow therefore fills that home .
Had touched the deep , mysterious chords ,
But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes ,
The shining structures raised by lab ' ring gods ;
As love were all that life could give ;
And all the torture fires were laid asleep .
Can move my heart , contented with mine own :
No treason should her spotless person stain ,
To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore ,
And make the writer on a fairer leaf
The image back to memory brought :
Rich prizes wait for those who do not waver ;
From all the puddles went swilling ,
Ye 'll get the best o ' moral works ,
Which sent them forth as freshening showers to save
What i suggest , thy wisdom will perform :
Which a grove of myrtles made ,
Feeling and music move together ,
The scarlet vine creeping and clinging !
In trees , whose waving branches blurred
Forth from his mouth the bright blood sprang ,
This pious use keep sacred , thou and thine ,
My soul has oft a secret pleasure found ,
A kindred presence i had found , --
Till god released her of her pain ;
Now the rainbow humbugs soar .
Years have lightly come and gone
Those words of cyrus , which he made to stand
And the bears ' paws passed above thee .
Woods have made way for our cities of ease ?
Flashing leaped into the sunshine ,
With balugantes leon 's race comes on ,
' ow they creeps on unawares
Since michael and his powers went forth to tame
From the path that god has given ! ' "
Where freedom and his god may lead ,
To execute the vengeance of its wrath .
From all the south comes a wailing moan ,
To raise to heaven the face that never lied ,
And gates of branches green arise around ,
There came a noise of someone entering ;
Whom nature hath made apt for every change !
For dreams took shape in pure jacinth ,
To make it fair and fragrant .
Behold , the wind of the desert rose ,
Voices , confused , and faint , arise ,
Here go about for to recite
And working tongue , and danger in the eye ;
' my homeward journey i would take . '
Shall safety to italia 's plains arise ,
These silences our brothers , in they glide ,
Her anguish they assuage .
Ye see how i am , day and night ,
Grief grows a shape of light ,
Am worthless and feel as sear ;
The truth stands now revealed ; she has been false
Ye wake to feel the cold december !
And drank delicious passion from her eyes ;
The air is filled with some unknown perfume ;
So unaffected , so composed a mind ,
They gather all good things ,
The thoughts that arise in me .
And a winged summons came flying to the city .
Anticipative of the feast to come ;
Alas , old spring 's gone with the rose ,
Would on receipt immediately go ,
And as if satisfied , he held his peace .
In the " threesome , " some maintain ,
A vault , a tomb wherein was laid to sleep
Through life one mutual aid sustain ,
The course of life he had pursued ,
Our love for thee grows day by day ;
Strange oils and perfumes strained in indian vales ,
There lay the glade and neighbouring lawn ,
Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe
The hour before the dawn is breaking . "
" be mine to read the visions old ,
And caught the light capriciously , like wings
With feeble steps , supported by his friends .
Such lies that you spin .
Where mail , which cased the trojan hector 's breast
And i 'm taking the trail on trust ;
My young life to me now given ? "
They 're in their glory , mark their elevation !
Miss susan s. who hast my fancy took .
That always shows great pride , or little sense :
Old days come back to memory ;
As one in slumber held . not long that mood
It scatters abroad forthwith to all sides round
God keeps an open house for you .
Where once had stood a happy house , and there
In freer volume swifter currents show ;
First the landlords take the rent ,
Look as if heaven changed thy face ,
And the house that i love makes four .
Sore peril to thy realm will bring .
And round his heart one strangling golden hair .
A splendid image built of man has flown ;
None to give the hand of welcome ;
Nor would i move but to thy praise .
To the halls where my love lay dying ! "
For public fame said that bertoldo 's heir
Making us crave thy cloudy state no less
Is left to the exile to brighten his dreaming .
They challenge truth . a people makes reply ,
Till it touched the top of heaven ,
A douglas followed to the martial strife ,
Both armies urges to their mutual fate .
And all their country rushes on the mind ;
That cast it like a serpent from their hold !
Brief absence joined anew to feel ,
The trees around have lost their lovely green ,
The pure clean air came sweet to his lungs ,
And call you blessed while they shine .
Where clinking sheepbells make a broken chime
Then give them both the lie .
On each side , to meet anguish everywhere ,
The theban band leads up the delphic feast
Last summer i passed where the palace once stood
Nature-ally hold 'em in scorn .
From the hard season gaining ? time will run
Thy mastering music walks the sunlit sea :
O thou , whose bounty fills , 140 .
And hopes and fears give conscience all her power .
In hope of resurrection to meet with reward ,
Where parted souls with kindred spirits meet ,
Bitter , but one that faith can never miss .
With life in trifling service spent --
Of written joy , which wants the smile
On each side of her smile and lay
Such a haunted look his visage wore ,
Lights tip that mountain cavalcade ,
Could pour my secret heart of woes ,
But give to me the snoring breeze
The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes
But bend and let it go o'er you .
Who was suddenly seized with the plague ;
All hatred from my heart , but can not keep
Your thoughts should chance to turn to me
No angry clouds frown , nor sky darkly lower ;
Those that twist the churrak fastest
Thrice happy loss which makes me see
The faith i hold
But wisest fate says no ;
Of deeds heroic , wrought at duty 's call !
From where he stood to preach and pressed a path
For life thou must look to the little crook ,
Rolling far distant , as the crowd sent forth :
Then one by one the numerous laws were made ,
Neath the calm beauty of her forehead bared ,
Shall thwart the future where it lies in wait ?
Whose eyes the silken carpet did but meet ,
The hun swept over the plain ;
A fever seized him , and he made confession
Or break thy sinful vow :
( there they alike in trembling hope repose , )
Her brown hands clung -- her face grew pale --
Lust is the smallest sin the sex can own .
But i with mournful tread ,
Tryst . ye shall be set at such a tryst
Nine days they fell : confounded chaos roared ,
For the memory of many prayers clung to it ,
But when his worth my hand shall gain ,
To render marriage holy and divine ;
Take not the merit of it to yourself ;
Through the flowers they conquering glide .
That time bath not yet come for me .
His hives upset first met his eye ;
And where the streams swell to a gathered lake ,
He rouseth up himself and makes a pause ;
And in words like these expressed him :
In gracious fostering union garlanded ,
For thus went life : to lead the herds
The splendid car roll 'd slow in regal state :
For well they now can spare their wings ,
The years shall come and pass , but we
It was , she set to him for mark .
Till the dark power made firm the crushing spell ,
Take heart ! the promised hour draws near ;
Life and death he drew as circles ,
And in the song it mingled . and the dame
Blossoms of bright truth we bring ,
In the gentle voice that echoed ,
O that those lips had language ! life has passed
To tell their anger at this clash of swords !
Up from the sweet south comes the lingering may ,
Who is yonder poor maniac , whose wildly fixed eyes
To us , behold , all paradise reveal 'd !
By means of these , and the whole cause reveal
Some say the scheme with love stands luminous ,
( no reason given her ) she could cast aside
That make the dewy zephyrs their dim haunts .
Has found his upward way , i answer thee ,
The piper 's face fell , and he cried ,
Through me are reached the people lost for aye .
The carnival 's great sport takes place ,
My love bound me with a kiss ( jones )
That can meet this blade ancestral . "
And the rocking pines of the forest roared --
And horror stilled the rising gale .
Bright banners floated in the air ,
Nor held my life in less esteem ;
And passion , grown too tender ,
The tidings passed of servitude repealed ,
Through the house give glimmering light ,
Merrily , merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances
Found his crop of barley growing ,
And catch the glances of the waking morn .
There shall come a great convulsion
And each to th ' others breast convey ;
Sorrow would flee and weariness take wing ,
When the other firms show dizziness , 284 .
By which he had drawn from nature 's visible
The deadly battle pitched in line ,
From valleys where her slumbering fathers lie ;
Dive again my tears to gather ,
The hermit from his task they drew ,
It is not in this form i see
Floated around me , filling all my soul
Faces that loved once , forever they go ,
The worship of that love through thee made known ?
Whoe'er may venture to oppose thy will !
Many who once had shone as monarchs lay .
The portraits hung of father and of mother ,
And the swan 's stately crest assumes .
Which leaves the fierce necessity to feel ,
Against his liver heaved his bowels ; his heart
Save what pure love imparted .
Long burning sighs he slowly heaved ,
And satan carried his soul to hell .
Save that which cometh from the pure serene
And what makes a ' this courtesy ? "
To seek in foreign lands a happier seat .
From hence the maniac 's horrid rage they view ;
Where winter still did tread .
Beheld and passed that inner door , which gave
That heaven to life may render .
What spell , what magic raised her there ?
But the rich man reaps the gains
They crack a childish whip , drive puny herds ,
She feels who milks my favourite cow ,
Sparkling , flashing in the sunshine ;
Pipes his sweet note to make your arches ring ;
About the moral these verses teach :
From everything but make-believe , come true .
The streamlet , as it murmuring fell ,
Till billows rage , and gales blow hard ,
To break with life the circling spell of death .
The sparks fly from the crackling thorn ,
Raise to be beautiful , perfect , and holy .
In scripture , till the night had fled ;
How she bore or flower or bud ;
And weeping , thus his mournful message gave :
The heart would come into my throat
Then , after anguish , came the supreme bliss -
That makes things as they are the real divinity .
But science shows what results may be ;
Its empires may topple and fall :
And turn to blessings watched by heaven !
From nowhere else the light of day might come ,
Kabul town 'll go to hell --
And from his reverend face such glory beamed ,
And of war 's horrors thus obtained a view --
What wishes rose that death might take his wife ,
So much on their minds there lay .
O well for the leading that follows the law
A first edition worn with age ,
Comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears ,
That keep the seas in wild unrest ;
That made a garret of wholesome herbs ?
The crude reality of things awoke
Give back my book and take my kiss instead .
But his fierce wrath with fearless grace sustained ,
And the myriad roar of a great crowd rose ;
Will you not help to hold our battle line ,
The holy vision hovered .
But comes at last the dull and dusky eve ,
Yon rising moon that looks for us again --
The loss of her whose love looks through
Thus came enclosure -- ruin was its guide ,
So spring for them passed on to summer .
When the pine-boughs yielded round you ,
The flames ascending from the blazing ships :
Strongest of men , they pierced the mountain boar ,
That would bring gladness to your eyes .
And certainly he show 'd the best of breeding ,
The thrall in the darkness plunged with his knife ,
With honour , which he haughtily had sought ?
With mingling blazes shed a flood of light :
But the spirit grasped her arm .
Giving sweet odors to welcome the may .
I needs must deal in strife with thee ,
Which many people take for want of heart .
His weapon stood , -- and all the iron head
We turn to catch one fading ray
' she found me roots of relish sweet ,
By the darkness wherein grew thy sacred forces ;
To eat up errors by opinion bred ,
And joy shall overtake us as a flood ,
The sound of singing goes .
Now far the night advanced her gloomy reign ,
As some wild animal that gets a wound ,
I have drawn on your love as a garment .
And though his tyranny did proue so vile ,
Withdraws , and falling stars to sleep invite ,
So maggie runs , the witches follow ,
With trenchant steel they made the way ;
By the new factor , then combine anew
The good stars met in your horoscope ,
None left but by submission ; and that word
Her garter i recall anon , --
Wrung from his children 's agonies ? --
Till life 's last pulse shall beat ;
Care ne'er shall reach us more ,
Wide from the timely word with conquest charged ;
With joyance bring her and with jollity .
The waves are breaking on the shore .
And calm and deep the waters grow ,
This calm retreat possessed .
Keen regret and grief for the pain i gave him
The wounded oyster draws its laboring breath .
Eternity was made for them ,
But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself .
There is no room for passion -- strife would blush
Water its living strength first shows ,
And there take root an island salt and bare ,
How oft the sadness that i show ,
May not remember , much less tell the sound .
How many days we spent together !
On pleasure 's wings she fix her brain ;
With that perverseness born in man ,
Whose petals tremble o'er the shadow 'd streams !
Merely to show your worth ,
Leave thy troubles to the elk-herds ,
And added courage to the pagans most ,
Till the mad vapour mounted to his brains .
Surprised his heart , and flashed across his face
Divine on human , pleasure came from heaven .
Nor by demerits of his deeds is cast ,
Her lips with happier blood ; the pain lay meek
As when the living music swoons
The mother hides her trembling fear ,
Radiant as lilith given from god 's hands .
From the centuries that are gone ,
Or was the hunger that had made it hollow
That pleasure flies on rapid wings !
A noise of running water whispered near .
A coward cringing to an iron fate !
Borne on athena 's bosom closed the war .
And distant empires own his holy sway .
The light is gone and winona dies .
Black smoke rising to the heavens
Fail somehow to set me ablaze ;
For arrogance noted ; to his memory
To ward off wrong . for psyche of the greeks
Of a summer that lived for us ,
Nor would have trusted in his host combined .
What time the moon was lost behind a cloud ,
No league of nations scheme can make her gay --
That if by artifice thou move to wrath
And in her pearly ear hath poured the breath ,
That overright was seated at his oar ;
The golden chain they round him throw ,
Long centuries have come and gone .
However satan may rage and roar ,
To win success though foes assail ,
Would keep the promise he whilere had made ;
Which made my heart to glow ;
His name , at least , did not go down
We see not now their like again .
Draws from the portals of the east ,
The caster sits far off from any fear .
It caught the reflex of the sunset sky
By age and sorrow left upon her face .
And forward spurred his steed and gave the charge .
As forth it went with merry song ,
" might to their fate all foes pursue ,
The clouds are broken in the sky ,
Such sleep as pure contentment ever brings ;
As color into flowers when they unfold .
Each works its end to move or govern all :
Clasping each hand about his waist to bear
Then blazing torches rolling pitchy flame
Broke but the bond of love which nature makes .
Striking its pearly harp of mystic sounds ,
That drank the current of my heart ;
The tall trees bend their laden boughs ,
And immortality but make it less !
But heaven 's free love dealt equally to all ?
Were sprung from hugh , high prince and lord
Dark with the sad looks that it bears along ,
They spoke of progress spiring round ,
It shall stay and cheer the end !
And , ere one flowery season fades and dies ,
To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality .
The joys of past years to renew .
Upon that word the franks again make yare ;
They made , and the ridiculous grimaces ,
I will throw by my book . the weariness
Broadly to rest upon the ruins grey ,
His eyeballs flashed with fiercer flame .
And leave no traces where it stood ;
Blood-sullied , and his ringlets wound about
Content , but how to savour hope deferred .
Then beauty showed her youth and grace
And the landscape spreads more dreary
The gradual uncounted years go by ,
To point his duty ; he was glad
The brave barbarian was put to rack
Or resting from the dance 's pleasing toil . "
And own they gave him a lively notion ,
These attain the mighty life you see . "
Choose whom they please to bear their great commands .
Heaven breathes through every member of the whole
With bitter words his wife addressed
Shall venture to give laws to thee ?
That free love with bondage bound . ’
Four ample measures held the shining frame :
From all their glory , she had caught
To catch an after-dinner nap ,
Bright tears dimmed the eyes of nell .
In haste the prince arose , prepared to part ;
Like the once glorious hopes he blasted !
Which from my bosom seeks to flow ,
Nor can the rapid sight pursue the flying horse .
I shall drive thee to the summer ,
Thy belted first-born in their fast embrace ,
The dawn comes cold : the haystack smokes ,
Thy spirit caught no taint from earth ,
Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred .
Then all the concert sang with such a shout ,
May have diverted from continual watch
So that from me the shadow reached the rock ,
The malice by kaikeyí shown ,
I closed and drew for my love 's sake ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
To rally a handful and to hold the height :
The pulse that beats in nature 's bosom
Prayer for all who lie beneath .
And roar unceasing ; so a dread sound rose
And all distaste from frail affection takes .
My truthful father thus addressed
She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair ,
Quick folded , thrust in envelope , addressed
Upon his cross , with head sunk low ,
Then up she took her little crook ,
In each lead and iron shower that they send ;
The heart clings fondly to the last faint hope
List to my words thus interwove with sighs ,
Quite melted into tears for thee .
The love that he once in his mercy gave ,
The lowliest duties on herself did lay .
To crush the fiends in human masks , whose might
Into the depths of ages ; we may trace ,
Nature , suspending lovely toils ,
Unable to resist , he took to flight ,
Gives to each mead a neat enamelling .
And spring returns to stay . . . .
That peace may be regain 'd .
Thy longer life i scarce can bear ,
And at its limit lies eternity .
Or make themselves but wells of tenderness
And leave to truth each noble name
And make it serve the purposes of men ,
That precious fruit of sons may bear . ”
That orison can bend decree of heaven ;
As her strong cliffs hurl back the streaming seas .
Which made the room resound like thunder --
And last night merged into perpetual night ;
The place thou fill ' st with beauty now .
Should scan such secret truth ; for he had learnt
At length from that cousin an answer there came ,
Where nature reaches her hands to men ,
Shall earth yawn open and engulph the towns ?
And the blood of his fresh young heart was shed
Virtue may unlock hell , or even
That lay in the house that
She loses all her influence . cities then
Then shed dim tears in sorrow 's pew ,
What nature naturally most encourages ) --
For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth
Her virgin fancies , pouring forth more sweet ,
Yes , bound to win .
But of his light the beam , must needs attract
The bargain struck , -- few cares his bosom move
Could show the dearest love :
' to blast the fury of oppressive might ,
Fly with the leaves that fill the autumn blast
My home has lost its light ;
F is the fan it peeped wickedly over :
By the life that leads on to the bay .
All things appeared to share my saddened mood ,
Whence rang or flashed no hint of lurking peril .
The first art wont his great authentick will
From you diverted , and elsewhere bestowed .
At foot of russia 's throne to lie ,
And then the feelings bind the intellect .
And therefore in danger he freedom brought them .
Lies still and takes no heed .
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it .
By suffering is not dearly bought .
When trembling night-winds whistle
Then round him heavenly voices rang ,
It is so broad it covers the whole sky .
And softened pity steal in dew ,
That your love would never lessen and never go ?
As that which conquers life !
To send life flowing somehow through me ;
Then sank they to sleep . with sorrow one bought
And all round the candle the crooked shadows come ,
We 'll let the pun go , anyhow ) .
Woman to bear and renew .
Usurping brunswick 's pride shall lay ,
And god , if he pronounce upon such life ,
( led by a providence that makes all things
Pour 'd forth its bitterness and wounded sense .
As without learning they can take degrees .
His world was made anew . strangely his voice
He paid his debt to nature . his exploits
Now straying beams from day 's unclosing eye
“ with winding current through the land you sway ;
That told of some sick child 's treasured wealth ,
And gentle breeding went with gentle birth .
The love of thee makes labor light .
Sang glory to their heavenly king :
And since it was coming up had to come .
The din of battle and of slaughter rose ;
This echo comes to me .
And replied in words which follow :
Weary men find rest in its bowers ,
Where much hard labor stared them in the face ;
Where bullets whistle , and round shot whiz ,
But tenderer thoughts within him woke ,
And thinks peace bought and sold ,
But sleep hath given a silent sign ,
Each year , as chill november brought
At first the silent venom slid with ease ,
These rich regalia pompously display 'd
Too great for prison which he breaks with gold ,
And meeting hour they noted down ;
By the sky-frozen elements fed ,
To all its puzzles found some answering clue .
Death 's shadows crept over her face ,
When withering blasts of error swept the sky ,
The brook crept silent to our feet ;
While the chilly winds are bearing
And the autumn breeze sighs tenderly .
Where never a cook of refinement is seen !
And the beauty it wears will never grow old ;
To keep me happy all the day .
All coming fate , close hid from human sight ,
To make of nought reason sentencious
How soft the hours steal by ;
Nor what pursued them in that fearful chase .
Ranged in a line the ready racers stand ;
Of toil the crowded city moves to lay
And time 's unsparing ocean swallows all ;
Her conscious tail her joy declared :
To ask our counsel , or our orders take ,
As dreamily i gaze , there seem to rise ,
And thus again his answer made :
Future shall rise and be free ,
Finding excuse of no avail ,
Then fell on merlin a great melancholy ;
Time steals from love all but love 's wings ;
Such wrongs religion in her train doth bring .
Pope 's manuscript supplies two omitted lines :
And the months enter on their mighty march .
And gainst enchantment huge complaints he rears .
Which is the life of nature , shall restore ,
Soon came a third , your love to win ,
Thence there comes the shining moonlight ,
To give it sunlight , starlight ; while is blown
Can hurt that noble memory . think of him
That catches but the palest tinge of day
Sentiment sighing will not help you there .
Sages cast down the gods , to change the void
The stars would shine in how much better heaven ,
What lies beneath of young or fair
And to its lips thy story tell ,
Ráma went foremost of the three ,
Which is a name they give a ' orse
Of faith still onward takes its flight ,
Has turned old fable into modern fact
Do n't let them send it cold .
The dame made a curtsey ,
As some old oak whose crest a forest clears .
A maiden ’s dreams might frame her knight ;
The burial office read ,
And my bright hopes lay ruined at my feet ,
Is taken by an elfish choir ,
Could show the cause and mystery .
So still , as life itself were fled ,
To me are known the various woes ye bore .
Fain would our souls feel all thy kindling love ;
Another grave was added . -- he had found
Draw forth the monsters of the abyss profound ,
Then in his wrath arose
Have set their sober impress on his brow ,
Of light , to follow the divine
Which shines upon a landscape , snowy-white
A faith , that shines by night and day ,
This tragic story cheered us ; for it speaks
Is seared with weeping and watching in vain .
The sunshine seems blown off by the bleak wind ,
Often treachery lurking lies
Nor waves nor breezes murmured there ;
Still your singing led the way . _
She stood up in the meekness of a heart
To grey the long perspective goes ;
As the military comes .
Queer freaks of vision weirdly wrought were seen :
Her chill hand fluttered like a bird in mine ;
Or moisture lies , though doomed to die they lap
Shall to-morrow find its place .
Should thy hunger still impel thee ,
And burned a way for love to enter in --
And teach thee how the happy shores to find .
And thus the blood went dwindling more and more ,
Which bade the series of events extend
Laughed , and shivered , and fell into darkness .
Clouds carried with a tempest , unto whom
And the barons that service to him vowed ;
Nor flattery 's self can pierce his pendant ears .
Now both together die . the soul flies forth ,
No thing that claims a tear .
No ; guided by our country 's laws ,
To which i turn a wistful face
While the hours , all gently bound ,
In the other chap 's hold , you see .
How low when angels fall their black descent ,
For his agony to pass ;
With amorous steps pursue the virgin light ;
Where stretches into mist the severn sea .
Findes something there fate can not overcome ,
A hope that hath with my affections grown ?
This night spoke in the rocking of the winds !
By drinking the first he took
And it makes his heart rejoice .
At random , sometimes hit most happily . _
And half the skies descend in sluicy showers .
To whom the lord of islam bends his brow ,
One strange barge that snowy tapestries enfold ,
With fame that name he bore ;
How he in france should find the warrior bold .
_ when old winter , creeping nigh ,
And o'er the vision swept the closing wave .
Great overseer , i make my prayer .
Than what i felt on finding i was brought
Bringing to mind the burning time
Now that peace once more was settled ,
From our fate a lesson borrow :
Columbus -- ha ! -- their motions he directs ;
Leaving imperial web to those who wear
Again the sabbath day came duly round ,
I can not bring myself to drop the quill ,
Whene'er a noble deed is wrought ,
But in my speech was naught could give affront ;
In vain this anxious search is made ;
That you within these shades i see
War won them now , war sweeter now to each
And faintly over hills and hollows comes the cry
That armour 'd train with waving fires to thread
Of justice , that before the tyrant , stood
The bold example all his hosts pursue .
New problem in literary art presented to virgil
And prostrate pressed the battle field .
But hung upon the object . to soft flutes
So she strove against her weakness ,
_ curious and rare _ his ardent mind engage .
They beam on beauty 's fragrant breast !
Reach upon reach of burial -- so they feel ,
Which drank the current of my heart ;
He turns some vast philanthropy to gold ;
Bright grew the sunshine , and the soft summer air
Thence there springs the water 's riches ,
Crete 's ample fields diminish to our eye ;
But bearing still some marks of girlish taste ;
Now will i open unto thee -- whose heart
And the tears swam into my eyes .
Of memories shall we depart .
Next prussia took his turn to melt ,
Moans like a man that 's starved .
Some kill their love when they are young ,
And duty gives her call ,
And dashed the lie back in the mouth
That rises unafraid and full of joy
With the drops his heart had shed .
Which soothe his grief and crown his bliss ,
Only to yield thee gladness of my voice ,
And fruitless are the many tears they pour ,
Where its black body cut into the sky .
Of golden horns that sang to rest
The rest stood trembling , struck with awe divine ;
" she 's in earnest , it appears . "
And fury in his bosom burned :
Shall , in the vengeance it dispenseth , find
Its mossy sheath half rent away , and sold
Content to set your heart on things above
Is the great chain that draws all to agree ,
In those , whom choice or different fortunes place
That soon will beat all his religion out . "
But once thy tidings told , wander not thou
Spinning the unnumbered threads that time hath woven ,
A shapeless soul , vain onset he had made ,
Happier days thought good ;
May not see the light of morning . "
Fear not the shudder that seems to pass :
Grief only for high hopes blinded ,
But life gone breathless will she reinstate .
This brought a smile to every face ,
While sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves ,
That it gives a fearful grandeur
And turned to sleep 's forgetfulness of care ,
Nor shine like fur upon a beast of prey ,
Confound our foes and fill them with dismay .
“ diana 's sports close following . fiercer love
Then set apart the dread of worldly shame ,
Give her worlds to love , and then --
She did not care ; his letter never came .
Leave off ; thy empire is already built ;
As the blush stole up its fringe to meet .
Heaven there in twofold azure lies ;
Limbs that a veil demanded , as she sank ;
Whose gossip history has given
To take the sorrow whole .
You shall make in christ confession plain .
The bloom of life provoked in me
A chilly tremor through my bones just ran ,
What was it filled my youthful dreams ,
The laws that give all beauty being !
It rolled the smoke from trafalger
And gave short speech to mary sweet and wise ,
My hope fallen dead , my singing cast away ,
Who went to thank her ;
That lay unclaimed before them to possess .
Where merry hearts had met despair
With hair escaped from some arabian night ,
A calamity sudden and heavy to bear .
' neath the mountain sought for raspberries .
Love meant this universal cry of pain ,
And she with pain drew breath :
And war and vexation all coming together :
Caution , to direct them rightly . "
So shall those falling flakes spread sea-like far
Her sad eyes turned to heaven , where thou
The choir of angels caught the word ,
Paradise spent , and wage for merits given ,
A hopeful joy upon the day to come ,
But now the time approached , when he would pour
He would reach a thieving hand ,
To make it -- as the lucky fellow might --
Joy , that transcends all sweetness of delight .
The revellers rushed into the night .
Would take my heart , if of his grace ,
Again the branching streams begin to spread ,
Nor poison , to compel the fatal end .
Which makes him -- clean back of the power
With no hoarse dissonance to stir the deep
His temples burst when he the horn sounded ;
It trembles into death ; yet comes anon
It is enough to shake one into tears .
Yes , go and carry comfort to thy friends ,
Bronzed , and the beamy winged bloom that flew
Leaps out again to triumph ,
Notes that sound like twin bells falling .
Hither , to take my last farewell of you .
Her eyes are carved of minerals pure and cold ,
And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away .
My brightest hopes giving dark fears a being
And we shall feel the agony of thirst ,
Where clung its last year 's nest ,
From east to west ran one white shiver ,
And all the hoarded wrath for olden wrongs
Where my winter home is made .
And have felt the cool , refreshing breezes
And still triumphant will his charge convey .
The white mists rolling like a sea .
Piercing the coal-black night , --
The sex is hurried headlong into ill ;
That gently plays by night ,
They leave th ' extravagance of song below .
Scouted those chilling forms that banish 'd ease ;
Which , like its type the golden cloud that hung
Quiet thoughts that flash like azure kingfishers
How south our home lay many a mile .
He finds but so much more distress and pain ;
Yet suffers least , and sways the wavering fight ;
By the pale spectre pushed ,
Is that of us she takes the best .
When him the wary paladin espied ,
The soul sits lost in love :
And give due honour to their reverend feet .
Take thou my blessing thus , and go
Swords than a hundred joined to lay him low .
Out of the centuries that made them wise .
His life in one low cry broke over mine !
Gives all the advantage , makes the difference
And such terror would make ,
Never turn lamps out and never go sleep .
There came the angel of death .
Which made its orbit with the lesser arc .
Both steal o'er me ; joy , that also
And rich and poor shall take thy guidance then .
And pass their own inventions off instead .
For him we found the melancholy lyre ,
No other doctrine needs , though granted true ;
That told him fireflies winked among the wheat .
But the night-wind cries : " despair !
The soul subsides , and wickedly inclines
And make thee smile at all the magic tales
And brings the blushes to her cheeks .
To make thy maids and self free mirth ,
Until thou see god 's kingdom come .
The drink that to his cost good icarus drew
Bereft of all his sires held true ,
The naturalists have not yet touched upon .
An instinct within it that reaches and towers ,
And from its strings what harmonies arise !
The moon that sways the rhythmic seas ,
God spoke , and it came out to hear .
And all things were touched softly by the sun ;
A patrick who will lift me from despair ,
Not the tears that fill the years
" for something made me feel my heart would break
And it turned to a sonnet .
There fell no chilling shade
Wainamoinen 's tears came flowing ,
But the sad dove , that sits alone
Till hues of faith shall gild the gloom ,
That takes the sunshine and the rains ; "
Like a timid person who gets gooseflesh ,
Comes this memory of delight ,
Should mix with ours , the vanquished . destiny
While space illimitable stretched before .
All fire-flush 'd when forest trees redden
A wind makes dance the fine acacia leaves
For weight prevents all things should come to pass
As if in anguish that it stood
And no sound came , except of seas remote ,
Give thy commands , o king , and say
A creaking voice for a clear treble goes ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
And his shooes beaten out with traveling .
It lay a land of sleep and dreams ,
One o'er the cradle kept her studious watch ,
Within his bending sickle 's compass come ;
Was law , and that which keeps the law ,
And no light word should stir upon my lips
Its shadows now here far withdrawn ,
Before my yearning vision lay my home ,
And make a crowning for this kingly brow ! --
Leading to the northland-treasure .
The water dwells a multitude , whose sighs
From what once lovely lip it springs unseen !
And him had plunged in uttermost despair
Far extend the sky and waters ,
Were thrown into great commotion ,
When the snow has gone that drifted them under ,
To brace the nerves , to cure repining ,
Made my veins hesitate , and gracious heat
In springtime comes , when lingering winter flies ,
Is seriously considering proposals which have been made to her
Were half the breath that 's vainly spent
Into your heart is come a mortal hate .
Must suffer change , disdained not to begin
Red shone the angry scar
Now sloping down to sorrow , mounting now
Whence from those steep 'd within loud shrieks arose .
When christ had given the multitude so much ,
What makes that ship drive on so fast ?
Has stood above all deaths and all delights .
Complete are now the bounties you have given ,
Some bearded meteor , trailing light ,
_ chorus . _ let water quench the fire .
Two years have gone , and again i stand
The suit with offers and with gifts was crowned ,
That gave another burns ,
In tones that with it strangely went
Take note of men who 've made success :
Some sainted relic of a lost belief ,
I caught my mother 's parting breath ,
Glance at the musical phrases , and pass on ,
If it so chance no fog comes rolling in ,
She rises still : the liquid light she spills
It bath taught me that which i most cherished
Like him shall with light be flooded ;
Strong consolations ; leave them not to doubt
As winds come lightly whispering from the west ,
And make fear dig its own false tomb .
Sir roderick in suspense he eyed ,
To leave thee only a more dark eclipse !
A brighter glory waits a muse like thine .
Penciled upon the throne , and as it waxed
Each to its champion left a nation 's cause .
Not the tears that fill the years
Which god hath in his mighty angels placed ! )
With oil , your beauteousness will shrivel .
Set in a sightless grin ,
How silent comes the water round that bend !
His prayer assisting ; flings her winning arms
Of angry steel that instant rang .
Everything went to ned brown from me .
When all the warring world was swept with pain ,
Within ayodhyá ’s city passed .
And a heart , ravenous , trails in the wood
Thus cycles vast will find our names combined . "
The call fer dinner reached his ear .
The speedy gleams the darkness swallow 'd ;
Which the west indian market scarce would bring ;
Boldly in sin , shall feel more punishment .
So come they character to me
Here comes the wind of the blow !
While glimmering truth more dreadful makes the gloom :
But mortals pass in fast and endless train .
The mantle it fades , many rents it reveals ,
For matter infinite needs infinite worlds must give .
Which holds three persons in one substance knit .
Doth heaven with all its splendors lie ;
With moon-white hearts that held a gleam ,
Thus wailed he broken by his woes :
Treble confusion , wrath and vengeance pour 'd .
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
And all the smiles arose as from the dead ,
As silently as gathering cloud it rose ,
One felt , unseen , infection circling there
As if it breathed a sigh for marguerite .
Old prisoner , dropped thy blood as rain
And have made the arch to rattle ?
But the free life that would no longer feed
All the winter lay .
No ; guided by our country 's laws ,
A life-husk into which the demons go ,
That nothing shoots but war and woe .
There rested the tremulous trace
' so frame your letter in a metamorphosis .
According as you find . '
And as to us the flag has meant
The tender moment seized , and thus i said :
And through my lips that uttered sin
What treasures of art these pages hold ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
Come and be made ashamed of thy renown !
For so the will did run .
And self-indulgence held him in its sway .
But counts that gain which others reckon loss .
Passing the sweet sweet of a musky rose .
Beowulf spake , and a battle-vow made
The gloom , the shadow , passed not by ;
From thee takes timely warning ,
And you hurled your bold defiance at the wild .
When lilacs toss their purple plumes
Silent is the house : all are laid asleep :
Instead of hand , return a hugging squeeze .
The october night comes down ; returning as before
I heard but once that witching lay ;
That gives us back the image of the mind .
There let the common heart keep time
And from a leafy branch in linked clusters swing .
And breathe the sweets that rise
The clock struck one ,
Missing my joy , i walked the earth ,
Cast aside thy gloomy temper .
An angel flashed by on his gorgeous wings .
Did make provision , thorough grace alone ,
Here set i down some dreams that come again ,
Gives all the strength and colour of our life .
Which made my heart to glow ;
The dreams they fall on rich and poor ;
And sent soft waters murmuring by ;
Where the sweet water of life flows on ;
The lark throws down a lay ;
That could almost make me cry .
Till nature in her final wreck shall lie ,
Though it have brought destruction on the world .
To let the soul go free .
No sounds of sadness surged through listening trees :
I saw what forms the lordly powers employ ;
Nay , of thy name so oft i mention make
Einar then , the arrow taking
Loud , deep , and lang the thunder bellowed :
How falerina lost it to that lord ,
The happy days unclouded to their close ;
But feels the primal blessing in his blood .
He spoke , and sheathed in arms incessant flies
And some way made each to the other known .
" ' why sits ulysses silent and apart ,
It comes , but , like a passing breath ,
All flashing with your joy as flash the stars ,
Without the hand to help , had labour spent .
To bear the sight of dull decay ,
Would win again his reputation lost .
And horrid whispers set the cheek aghast .
All flashing with your joy as flash the stars ,
Raised my eyes to hers of unfathomed azure ,
Except of sighs , that made th ' eternal air
And every heart leaps up in singing fire .
The moon makes everything much stranger .
No portion asked , cassandra ; mighty deeds
And behind the dark pines drops the sun ,
It ceased ; the king takes up the strain ;
Before minerva shot the livid flames ;
For ye met with your destiny
The sacrifice and worship , god revealed ;
Brave men who ne'er will feel alarm ,
Earth gives thee perfect rest :
The clearness of the flame i equal make .
The goodly bales her decks revealed ;
With their dilated nostrils spread ,
Its glories all are given .
Till the goal is reached ;
Made all the warm air mellow .
" resistless beauty which thy smile reveals . "
Unharmed and unmoved while its waters ran by .
Huge trunks they wrap . this giant oak
He cries aloud , to make the combat cease :
And union find in freedom ?
And make my future life the sport of fate .
And the house where love had died ,
And falter as the promised land i see ;
A woman met a man with ears spread out ,
And feel content and wisdom in your heart ,
As gave to objects , late so blight ,
And to secure his crown the martyr dies !
Now has the lingering month at last gone by ,
Noting the visages of some , who lay
Then went her sunshine way : --
As he turned seeking sleep , the dreaded pain
They lifted up their hearts to the new dawn
How many grains the summer bears ,
An earth which i would not refuse to take ,
But now from out the chaos there arose
To change sad things for brighter i am seeking ,
Could make a mortal maid appear divine .
Dear hands stretch out from the past ,
Youth , from thy bosom welled their passionate lays --
Gusts of it made their hackles rise ,
Then , as a sigh escaped his breast ,
Sent to the king great threats of war ,
Uplifted on his wings and sought the sky .
Calls danger near , and death invites
As the rose , with fragrance weeping ,
And kiss my mouth when i fall on sleep .
So he awaked his fury and disdain ,
Where the long road winds through the wood ,
And like a stream of silver flecked with gold
This doleful chorus led on : --
Spoke the very words which follow :
Th ' escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks
What hast thou found in the spring to follow ?
When the taxes had been settled ,
Thoughts that breathe , and words that burn .
Of what it said i knew not any word ,
Banish the darkness filled with quivering dread ,
His mighty arms about him threw .
To sorrow abandoned , but worse felt within ;
She slew , as prompted by her cruelty ,
And sent a prayer into their father 's ear .
My road leads me seawards
Strength swells thy boiling breast , infused by me ,
The sun gives ever ; so the earth --
To all whose praise can glory lend her ; --
He stood perplext , then set himself to wait
And i think the rations has made them ill ,
Of flesh to flesh , wherever love may go ?
And here the temple where my heart shall sing
Clear water has the quivering radiance caught ,
For none a happy life may see
With lenient arts extend a mother 's breath ,
" there goes the curly-headed boy --
To the fond vows thy passionate accents swear :
The time draws near the birth of christ ;
As the chill 'd robin , bound to florida
While in its noose of terror bound ,
Their beauty dropped out of the loneliness
The raptures of thy face unfold ,
He pined and sighed his soul away .
Bitter within her , and her spirit grew
Shaped forth a disembodied world .
In pensive sadness , born of wild delight ,
And fear of death deliver to the windes .
Before the stars have left the skies ,
Shall lift her brightest wreath , untouched by time .
The wilding blossoms make a tender sound ;
Slanting through the silence of the long past ,
Such woeful tears she shed .
Hateful and hostile grown ;
Which beats the dark red realm of pain ,
For i am come with power to bless ,
I hurled my youth into the grave .
And blend with all that 's beautiful -- sublime --
Fly as fast as wings can bear thee ;
While seasons come and go !
Faith should be kept unbroken evermore ,
It may redeem thee to a fairer date .
I mark the tenor of the dread decree ,
And the hawthorn spreads its blossoms fair ,
Too quickly comes the evil day .
The bitter sleep that knows no wakening ,
The west , the celebrant obtained :
Little crying wind-sounds come before the king .
Can prose that 's polished by the file ,
Righteous lord of heaven held long discourse with abraham :
Here he forms the tenses wrong . -- wakefield .
And to the listes came they by time :
There he still led the singing and took part
What pleasure to his works i owe ;
Lost in effect , while science seeks the cause .
A blessing drawn from supernatural fountains !
Tire of leaping passion ;
And walls of warriors sat that night
When my soul touches yours a great chord sings !
England and france to eat him up at last .
And the sun gives way for night ,
Death 's gates indeed burst open . the night yawned
You 'd think his memory might be satisfied ---- "
Of wind and beating snow , or renovated
Pine-clad peaks ! rushing waters !
To weave the web of a deathless song ,
The world saw the new light of godlike good
Give all your heart to god ?
A thousand rills their mazy progress take :
Then rose the long lament
Scaring their foes from biding the red fray .
For a present his grave-shroud they folded ;
Which the lapland children fashioned ;
All the world over , nursing their scars ,
Upon the prophet they their powers bestow .
When love and vengeance prompt the blow !
Where that old meadow of battle smiles away
Destroys the peace that ruled the fields of death .
Stared down at him with its cold , white glare
Cities once great , now fallen .
Sometimes my sorrow . from the mountains came
To copious wine this insolence we owe ,
That show themselves , like grains of gold
And on to every ship that ploughs the wave
And soft scents strayed from the violet 's throat .
The golden sun rose from the silver wave ,
Give place to evening 's shadowy gray !
A promise or vow a lorraine has spoken . "
And fancied isles are turned to real lands
Summer is come , though winter months be here --
Thought him entitled to belief
When youth itself survives young love and joy ?
First parted , then closed in upon its prey .
The angel of the cross roads lead me out ,
Who only affection and sympathy feel ;
But with its sound it shook the sails ,
Amid such groves was consecration made
The momentary heaven the rainbow lit
He got two wounds , a d. s. c. ,
For knowledge would bring hope to sudden death ,
Until the globe with its bright fellow lay .
' to lay the bill before the parliament . '
The stars they shot alang the sky ;
And add some splendor to thy future fame .
You may have seen the winged lightnings fly ;
A letter from this arielle fell , which read :
His blood runs free and warm ;
And here again the trees arose
Would deceive ourselves with this stepping into heaven
Death hath given her this grace .
How the oath was kept , can tell .
The hush of sleep falls on the earth
It sails straight on , forgetting pain ,
While the dew on it lies ;
That , like thy petals , trembles in possession ,
That has come from the maiden heart
But with flutes of fear they filled the ear ,
The vision of the rumour will not flee .
Casting a dim religious light :
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned ,
They added to the gift and asked again ;
Pondered deeply and reflected ,
The gale follows fair abaft .
That reared , that lit the roman race ;
That rested on the seventh day and scanned
Dominion draws ; the time is come to choose ,
Mixt with the liquid light that lies
But once engaged , he finds his contract please ;
A lovelier and a lonelier evening came ;
When the blood of thy victims lies red on
On his broad back a tower has put :
His heart with ruth and wonder stirred :
But not another word said they .
Or cheerful fields resume their green attire .
The snow that lies in drifts ;
While each on each the furious rivals run ;
The secrets of the wind it sings ;
Cloud and rain-tears pass they fleet !
Rushed the dread demon on his foe .
And favourites fall as falls the flower ,
And then my temper ' ture i took .
Whose searching fire , no reason can withstand .
The happy winds their timbrels took ;
‘ judge if it stands not hard with me ;
Ere fear may feel the chill thereof ,
And through the peace there came to pass
That sprang on cyrstemesse nyht ,
The wished for twilight streaked the horizon o'er ;
And turn to sleep again but wake and start
Grain within grain successive harvests dwell ,
Which only blends with thought through tenderness :
The noise a very frightened child might make .
It told me more than many rifled graves ;
Up leapt the child , a wondrous bound ,
And , raising listless eyes , he saw himself
And when my spirit leaped to joy again ,
Sudden his eyes released their watery store ;
The sun went down the sea ;
The wild horse flies from the hurricane ,
Where nature reaches her hands to men ,
I see you remember the cynical story
That there may linger with our kind
Trembling the spectres glide , and plaintive vent
He had now reached the age of thirty years ,
Yet break they not this peace with alien tone ,
And a little time passed over ,
And shameful the spirit that gloats over wives
E'er shed his genial rays upon ,
As all the wager that good fortune pays ,
That the tides of time may cover ,
They peer in lighted windows glowing warm ,
And make dear friendships with the streams and groves .
In which a fountain , raining crystal music ,
Have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay ,
Through castled walls the hero breaks his way ,
Should rudolf come successful from the chase .
And mother 's time is spent
It made me love myself as i leaped to caress
Came , softly stealing the clouds between , a
The nightingale that in the branches sang ,
That the veil had won the prize ,
And glowing violets threw odours round .
So mighty was the aid that pallas gave .
In silence took her supreme vow of hate .
They look into the beauty of thy mind ,
Less melancholy , swallowed up in silence
Proclaiming that the day of wrath had come .
And gives a little round of deeds and days ,
" whereof thy youth felt all the spell ,
But the bear conveyed no tidings ,
Their votive incense bring ,
The gaps the fight had made .
Through every court that sits in session .
Then to her glass i lead the fair ,
Which he within me dictates , singing go . "
All misery taught to bear --
To whom much silence makes amends
But now ' t is turned to tears ; --
Lending the sacred gospel 's awe
The flies make golden blurs , that shine
Lonely monolith i stand ,
Give thy thoughts no tongue ,
Rose to a frenzied heat ; the naked dancers leapt
As any tongue can tell .
The visions departed , and shame followed passion : --
Like an old picture softly made alive ,
And nowhere fell the sound of song or wings .
What made more sad the outward form 's decay ,
Cold as a cause outlived , or lost ,
Which violets feel , when call 'd upon to lie
Creep weaving and winding their mist
And all the band got blazing drunk
Like a ship leaning above blue water .
To lead th ' unsettled mind astray ;
And the sun made answer plainly :
This heart still turns to thee .
Endless , and no solution will be found :
The sea of anguish rests in peace ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
Remembering joy who has taken wing !
A bold defiance speak , and come to blows .
That thou make no denial of awaiting
For even weeds that sow themselves , frost reaped
With not one thought that breathes the feeling heart ,
To bring that homage which men use
Then relate what has befallen
To which the drowning clasp may cling ,
The flowers that fell from every spray ,
It bids the demon care take wings ,
So many in the field of death lay cold .
The finest , biggest fish , you see ,
If that fortune with him stonde ,
And cast the kingdoms old
A strange far look would come into his eyes ,
No fault in women to lay on
With that perverseness born in man ,
Eyes and lips expressing sadness ,
For endless industry . when day was gone ,
Inside of me says i am naughty ,
The shadow of a babe you trace ,
Spring sat dejected in a sheltered nook
For the cool _ summer _ dusk to come ;
Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower
Of paneled walls and ceilings beamed
No laughing cry , to hail thy victory ,
The character of corso is forcibly drawn by another
Why are we made joint heirs of bliss ,
Duty wears one face , but a thousand masks .
The shield of england come .
Italia 's bravest , and in triumph add
Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him .
The fog laughs low to see it go ,
Young children , lifted high on parent souls ,
May give the victory to the novarese ,
Whence sprung this dread demon ye sages tell ,
And spend their fury , and then pass away ,
The sun sinks now below this hopeless sea ,
Offerings meet for brahma 's shrine ,
Her woman 's heart come breaking through her eyes ;
Oblivion now their names hath well-nigh swallowed ,
Whom he took knowing she 'd thrown sparks already
The beaver plants himself to wage his war ;
And every trap that ever caught a dime ,
With anguish and sorrow my bosom did burn ,
Clouds of smoke arise to heaven ;
It may stand for her once in november
Must only think of that great gift he gave ;
The light of laughter went and came .
Save where god has sent the sorrow for the
Puts the wretch that lies in woe ,
And bannerman smiled and caught his breath , --
I saw him once , when gathering martial powers ,
The proposals for publishing these fugitives being addressed to
Which heaven to gaudy day denies .
It answered : " thee as in my mortal frame
And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies ,
Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things ,
Rock and forest piled to heaven ,
The chieftain made lavish atonement ,
Her voyage through thy waters make !
To show what man should never see !
Fear seized on the bold wan-ches-e
Setting some value on a titled name -
Our indian was brought to consent to be good ;
Underneath these possessing words that never fall .
Shall to-morrow find its place .
With a bright brave face i 'll see ,
Mournful forgetfulness hath broken :
And waited what should come to pass .
Till they reached the blue lake 's margin ,
Bowed in the firelight 's softly climbing gleam ,
To feel the breath of heaven on his face .
Which bears the soul of man along
Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe
And mountains flash in the rose-white dusk ,
I turn ; and france displays her bright domain .
For storms to beat on ; the lone agony
From what race you take your lineage ,
Thy life stays in the poems men shall sing ,
Where arthur 's wars are rendered mystically ,
One showed himself as one of the disciples
I recognize their sign , and feel at peace .
That bowed and blew with the whisper of god .
Whose feet have strayed from wisdom 's ways ,
I fled , to leave my past behind .
Disheartens thousands , and unmans the brave :
Brightening the mossy wall on which it leans
But scarcely was on earth extended , ere
My spirit rang achime
The copious rhetoric of arabia hung ,
What nature mirrors and reveals --
Are swept away with all we hate or cherish -
Shines as the face of a star .
For since the day is come that i shall die
That to this eden bore
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain . "
Ah , suns burn bright in eyes of panther ,
Virtue dispassioned naked meets the fight ,
A quiet country life to lead i crave ;
The spring will be sure to come .
And , touched with deep repentance , grieved ,
They gleam through spenser 's elfin dream ,
All shapes in turn that earth and heaven contain ,
To light our troubled pathways , wise and kind
Then be it as the laurel god he runs ,
Yet , with a brass that nothing stops ,
That scorched with greed their pleasant fields and villages ,
From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat ,
They probed his want of knowledge to the root .
Ages looked on while battling kingdoms bled .
And of the day ten hours were gone and past
But of his light the beam , must needs attract
But for all that 's gone and come ,
Her shop the mischief made .
Sleeping , was borne away by some strong spell ,
The noble prince , in his great self collected ,
Hush , and heed not , and fall asleep ;
Let common cares be lost in the same joys ,
To press thus hardly an immortal god . "
Can so discreetly the _ white humour _ take .
And they that suffer quit their debt at last .
To draw the proud king ahab into fraud ,
And gone are the faces i have known
Friends ' letters coming from his native place
Ye too bred of the summer 's heat ,
Perhaps in fairyland there chanced to be
And all the woes by vengeful bacchus wrought ;
And met disaster on the parthian plains .
Love 's a fire which consumeth
And hold the sunshine in its lap
But , ere they closed in desperate fight ,
In their fury , rolling , roaring ,
To get that shadow grin ? "
Bride , that into womanhood has ripened
Life offers nothing but contented minds .
The race 's glories shine :
An ' he loves ter see things start
The long rough tables ran ;
" for the bell will quench our memory ,
She read the thought within my eyne ,
Must go for life with broken hands unhelped .
No safety there they meet !
Its sword my spirit will not yield ,
To me revolving with the eternal twins ,
The old accustomed tone i could not find ;
And take this gift of heaven with grace ?
That circle which met round his sociable hearth ,
All alike withered and cast away .
But faint came a whisper borne along on the
It sees the ocean to its bosom clasp
But the dibbs that takes the hislands
Quick through the father 's heart these accents ran ;
He leaned on you in his sorrow ,
There , languishing awhile , prolong its breath ,
To scripture ’s guiding lore inclined ,
Of kisses crushed by kisses ; and he grew
The poet stubborn with his passion sang us
His little fair page now follows alone ,
There came a ghost to margaret 's door
Your face seems rising from the funeral pyre .
In kindred spirits , giving them a sense
Lies hid when youth reflects its soul in youth !
The curtained night in haste withdraw .
To make us as famous in council as wars ,
't was pity nature brought you forth
Hardly rises from the shock .
One low farewell would speak , --
An honest heart maintains its own :
For there a fatal image grows ,
The feeble tide of peevishness went down ,
Did of them all a perfect view embrace .
Fearing lest his strength should fail him ,
Where most the flowers of thought expand ,
Myself to spare ( because this touched but me )
Why drifts thy lonely voice always to me ?
Do they swing , as the tide swells .
The soul that looks within for truth may guess
The half-heard whisper ran .
Above the rest our britain held they dear , }
Like young pigs whipt to make them tender .
Tears from his closed eyes fell .
Is hid in life within the creature 's heart ,
Are considered no more than the regular blessing
Across the billows sweeping ;
Through the red skies her bloody sign extends ,
Could find refuge from the waters .
Extempore , pinned on a lady 's coach
That to my will gave wings ; and i began
" juno , thine anger carry not too far ;
Stood , as it chanced , in discontent ,
A soul thus wash 'd shall joyful rise again ,
Pensive she plied the melancholy loom ;
In the streets where the struggling cattle run --
And though he gave to each a friendly greeting ,
Lamented youth , thy spirit now has fled ,
My sight directed , and on either side
In grim repose -- their debt to nature paid .
They make young ducklings fat .
Whole ages have fled and their works decayed ,
" is wrought with tumult of acclaim . "
Stained by yellow suns that press .
Thy moist limbs melted into salmacis ,
To leave his strains of woe and ruth
As the clouds are swept from heaven ,
In souls as countries lieth silent-bare
And all these sounds one sound right well declared .
The nymph will change , the chord will break --
That 's what made his hair so straight ,
So greece to combat shall in safety go ,
A lonely house stands grim and dark --
I was whirled and tossed into delicious dancing
To think that such happiness could not remain ;
To the faintest streak ; then lit his light ,
And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep ,
And passion will cover with wrecks the calm sea ,
For all had put on christ 's righteousness .
The solitude of tears that make thee blind ,
Blush at the blasphemous worship offered them ,
And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall .
Their strife for bellows served to anger 's fire .
Thoughts as soft as sleep to hide in .
Her heart was troubled yet comforted ,
They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment ,
Of youth collect , to hear the revelation !
Thy hand upon my harp makes melody ;
These hours have gone with all their pictured scenes ,
And trails my fancy with its flow ;
As autumn suns shed round them when they set .
But breathe new courage as they feel the power .
That the rain may fall from heaven ,
Fly from the present in thought ; recall the days
And like reapers descend to the harvest of death .
Courage divine comes with thy lightest touch .
For tender accents follow , and tender pauses speak
My soul had shut the door of abode ,
Your memories have made you wise , old father ;
She would turn a new side to her mortal ,
Yet i forgive thee -- take my last embrace --
A wicked whisper came and made
Only to save me from such memories
On which my lamp soft radiance sends .
As if it swallowed up all other sounds
Those charms , for which a heaven was lost .
The rest complains of cares to come .
For feeling nerves and living breath --
And there the final desperate stand was made ?
It made him whistle , it made him sing :
Expectant of that news which never came ,
To spend their happy days ,
No praise was given thee of any kind --
Will shrink when mohawk war drums wildly beat .
You had felt not the shock of creation .
And i 've given them a shower . "
But shalt be sure to join the common flock ,
Other religions are buried in mists ;
And vengeance fed its torch from wrong ?
And each bright image wandered o'er his heart .
Than came that voice , when , all forsaken .
Beneath four chiefs ( a numerous army ) came :
Of pine-trees lightning-struck and broke .
That gives heroic impulse to the man --
So that at church he held grave airs ,
Making full circle of our banishment ,
To shake their faith and confidence in him ,
Shall have abode through day that knows no end
Its coloured lines where deeds of flesh stand bald .
That made our life so sad a span
Still expanding into bloom ,
She looks , and breathes herself into their love .
The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine
Long centuries had come and gone
Though clouds between hide both the warmth and light .
Her dark foundations , and too fast had bound .
I find in forests joy the keenest
To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal .
And where the infection slid ,
The finish to the picture , made him seem
And find a quincy very hard to treat ;
He smiles in love , and our souls arise .
See in the mists that ride the gale
Tall candles and set them aflame
They lay a hundred kisses sweet
Makes it meet for mere talk to conclude .
Rather accompanied , than venged the peer .
Slides from the rock that gave it rest ,
Hard is it to support the woe .
Clamoring yet where a faith lay stifled .
Angry tones that called his name ,
Than lose the blessed hope of truth .
By thoughts on earth ; your walls were laid ,
A seraph 's face of silver set in gold ,
And the fog blew off with the rain ,
Cheeks like to roses when they blow .
The bright wave murmured along on its pilgrimage ; ”
See , steamers steaming through my poems ,
Of some chimera caught in air .
Soon arose to quartermaster ,
She strives to pierce the blackness ,
Nor can i miss the way , so strongly drawn
They call for my surrender . i reply ,
While he softened o'er his outlined angel ,
We have what makes amends ;
And , snatching laughter out of death , her sons
Clouds never rise in wrath ,
Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove ,
Dawned on their industry , -- success .
Of the huge chasm , through which leapt thundering
But time has long since laid his head
The drowned sun sank and died . he lay
That the twilight makes it blind .
And let thy wisdom gather in the full ,
And nations rise where nations fell before !
The sea-born beads that bear his name :
And sway the grasses and the mountain pines ,
While i held journey hither out of crete
That 's only sad that it may please ;
With wide gray eyes still reading the blank air ,
Embracing held her , yielding , subdued ;
Part of the christian people should be set ,
Or , in the clouds , the tempest kept .
" give me credit ,
It saves me many a dreary mile ,
" when , by the winds of autumn driven ,
A moving sphere where spirits kept their trysts .
The prince that fills the british throne ,
He chains the forms , on earth that stood
My stump descends to meet the shrieking crowd ,
It brings to brows of poets crowns of pride ;
And calm the rising tempest of his soul .
Yet god a means hath found ,
That brings back hope , and memory back ,
So brightly pure that silver gleam is shed ,
Hush 'd as the nurse that bears a sleeping child
And the weight that he was lifting .
My troubled breast with grief they fill ,
For by no feeble hand the blow was dealt .
Trees from the root alone derive their strength .
To hopeless ruin . all roads lead to rome .
Who weaves each green leaf in the wind that trembles
His irony could hold them _ all _ awhile .
And the kind , simple country shines revealed
Which against false maganza warmed the knight .
The sad farewell we sorrowing took ,
For he bears an ancient wrong about him ,
Blest happiness from hope receives her birth .
On yonder eminence yet seems to stand ;
" that poet now has entered in
For we have felt a pang of woe ,
The tiresome days rolled round , never relieved
Oh , give me the spot where affection may dwell
Amid the mists that fill the evening air
I stand as a maiden to-day ! "
Came a chilly gale from the sunset ,
Which none but secret sisterhood may see ,
" thou feelest thy soul prepared ,
There came a fearful moment : i was pale ,
Men spent by sickness , or obscure decay .
There comes some purifying sweet belief ,
Shall we not hide our modest love between
Breaking the clouds where it was nurst ,
Filling all our hearts with sorrow .
And love is no novice in taking a hint ;
" the seasons vanish , and the stars decay :
To pass through scenes of horror and affright
And without a pound came to english ground ,
Panting there followed him a grey old man ,
But here or there as strikes the player goes ,
Think how thy youth like chaff did disappear ;
That blushing red no guilty instance gave ,
Down fell the piece dreaded so much in war ,
Are they not equal , netted by desire ?
And ministers , the offerings threw .
The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction .
Shall mortals to their reckoning call :
Both consume our life 's bright taper .
Yet when i sought to gain a larger love ,
He strews an ampler future 's seeds ,
The words of peasants reached his ear :
Some land may lie where those who weep
But i would shun the road to hell ,
Such lingering agony . their bowels racked
That burn through your prayers .
The nightingale that in the branches sang ,
Oh , turn its gaze from me !
In hours of bliss we oft have met ,
To learn , where science sure is found ,
In her , defect i never found ,
Must to the hell of sinners fall .
Back to the world my way i find ;
Love in my soul will wax in power ,
There lies forever
Next follow . every fern is tucked and set
From which no care can save ,
Then shrinking from unequal fight ,
And sends a comfortable heat from farr ,
The sunlight spoke soft to the shadows ,
That they might sift men 's hearts and wills ,
In loveliness , these grateful hands shall bear
And drive the mining beetle from its roots ;
The giant valleys gulp the night ;
Men cared for the women who found home the spot
Has gone on recklessly down and down .
But ( for it promised vantage ) he till night
Myself will charge this terror of the field . "
How does he find in cruel heart to hate
Casting from thence the blossoms of my spring ,
Ten years of mutual love to us had given ;
Fly as fast as wings can bear thee ;
That would make a fool divine .
Doth mark the needle 's faithful thrill ,
Her understanding all my meaning caught ,
Wide and deep the eye must go ,
Piled up in insult to his mighty shade .
Who will not raise a hope beyond the tomb ?
The whole world works in me to-day
Will make him more a devil than before ;
The expecting earth lay wrapt in kindling smiles ,
But the sentinel marmot 's shrill whistle of fear
Could find no other meaning in their sound .
Or on the shore will raise a pyre
Spoils which your loaded churches ought to show !
As made the french to stagger as they went .
Then perplexities arose ,
His dream ran thus --
Make mirth and hold high carnival .
Faith heaves the world round to the heavenly dawn ,
Still stood the king in thoughtful mood
Art shows practical effect .
Or cast rare heirlooms on the trodden way ?
That seemed to steal from her body
Now shines upon my spirit heavenly-clear :
And speak of what these pages said ,
How often have my sighs declared my anguish ,
Sleep will come when thou art fled ;
But ask the blossom if it soared in vain !
To make the youngster for his crime atone ;
Her hours went by in a long constant fleeing
No more that spirit , worn with sighing ,
His signal fire lit up the gloom ,
And in his cheeks the color went and came ,
No school can teach ,
Of music in the skies that rang ,
But all thy native strength resume .
As the third towards evening drew
And no forewarning gives ;
While th ' indian odour doth itself extend
Is desolate , the wind hath heaped the sands
Greatly rejoiced ; and thus his joy broke forth .
And weary days in penance spent ,
My heart was caught before i thought ,
If i may give thee pleasure so ) :
Yield us the comfort therein stored .
And nature , the old nurse , took
In those thin cells could lie ;
Look thou my steps pursue : the margins give
Love comes and goes as the free wind blows ,
To every relic some weird legend give ;
When the dark begins to creep ,
Those charmers who wear childhood 's graces .
And thus the brethren made a tidy sum ,
Then to be always feeding an ingrate mind ,
She comes elate with light , elastic pace ;
Its joys and sorrows to be met alike
And turned his face to the heathen horde .
Such sat those trojan leaders on the tower ,
Ev 'n love an ' friendship should give place
I would not lose my only hope .
Applause would ring on every side .
" open thy bosom to the truth that comes .
Spying out pathways dark , lost in dreary reflection .
Came the shadow of a cry ,
But lips where smiles went out and in ;
As winter bends the sea-foreboding pine ,
Till a silence fell with the waking bird ,
But legends hint , that had the maid
The merriest hours the world has ever seen .
Who would not poverty for riches yield ?
The having seen her little chastity ,
Earth and seas new colors take ,
And sought and found repose .
" but a little time passed over ,
Who took the sacrament of bread and wine !
Or make it fearful hazards try ,
Can seem to sigh and feign to feel .
The cabin to ruin has gone , ben bolt ,
The stars to look our way and honor us .
Where secret tears have left their trace .
But she herself cried out with aching voice ,
Should work its own decay .
The eagles floated , struggling with the wind .
And at the lifting of a hand sprang forth ,
Of hell i feel the pain .
Brass without weight gave these , and iron those ;
Hath found a sense too sweet to overpower ,
The touch that stopped the beating of the heart .
Forget six counties overhung with smoke ,
The marriage-rites to heaven ascending :
And millions fell by rules of art ;
Yet held he dear those gray majestic walls ,
That even the all-glorious north has borne .
Unto our ears these words from them were brought .
Such laziness held only good
Lord of the skies , his fear confessed .
And johnny _ newcome _ found himself afloat .
In the falcon 's jesses throw ,
Thus , by fraternal love possessed ,
Cringing , and pass 'd each step some compliment ?
In clouds , when autumn rules the lands !
And all dark things before it are made bright .
Roared the winds and lashed the waters
Rich moon has emptied all its gold . "
Cast from thy soul life 's selfish dream --
Thro ' pools of pearl it slipped
My heart is weary , my peace is gone ,
And now from far the mingling clamours rise ,
The rushing fishes streaked the seas with flame ,
Now useless grown , and rushed upon their fate ;
In vain he strove to breathe a prayer ,
And the whole valley wakes a brighter green .
I weigh not fortune 's frown nor smile ,
Though they lead apart to-day .
I come unlaurelled from the strenuous wars
As if wise nature had made that her book .
The saviour showed him that all outward wars ,
That i either think or see :
Her bosom heaved the deep drawn sigh ,
Raging , to seek for water that might slake
And larks , though paths go closely bye ,
Who laid their hearts and fortunes at your feet .
And the hurricane came sweeping ,
And entered there , a gate that stands ,
Oblivion , softly wiping out the stain ,
All day the fire bird burned my heart
Which asks no monarch , to support the stars :
Could tread them out to darkness utterly ,
The lesbian patriot smites the sounding chords :
To chilling fear that changed his face :
" i saw anothers fate approaching fast ,
Let nature take her way , "
For blunt denial , ere the suit be made .
And faithful to the facts my words shall stay .
But each day brings less summer cheer ,
To call to heart a peace for ever flown .
But ráma stood in pensive mood ,
Whilst all the house my passion reads ,
Crumbling and flashing and softly crashing
Then all its buried magic , till it flush 'd
And in their eyes and faces read his doom ;
May the angels guard thy rest in lonely graves ;
And found that he was giving me
All ilium comes abroad ; but had i found
Their summer gambols tell , and mourn ,
While earth , bathed in this holy light ,
Now , my good fortune is come .
Still harder teachings come to make me wise ,
Before his noble heart he firmely bound ,
The hand that held the steel :
The common pulse of man keeps time ,
The misty glass that still endures
Innumerable voices , rising , falling .
And a little ruffled-out throat which sings .
All valiant dust that builds on dust ,
To grasp endeavor 's towering pine ,
They watch the ages pass , they bring
That can touch the simple grandeur of the
Such proof as they are sure to find
And for his loyalty was put to flight .
Where mourning , first , hath led the way .
Simplicity , that knows not guile ,
To that which once ran through his soul .
His eager supplication made :
While ' neath , the turkish garment was confined
And stars that swim beyond our stuttering reach
Backward and forward her needles go , --
No sophistries could make him see
In thee , high heaven above was truest shown ,
Her heart was filled with a sad despair
When twilight and its shadows slowly creep ;
Where his dead hopes buried lie ;
And to celestial beauty gave
I might track thro ' each hard irish name
And so midst hopes and fears day followed day ,
With dandelions to tell the hours
I rose from dreamless hours
By grandeur guarded in thy loveliness ,
Might raise musaeus from his bower ;
Still lingering on thy lifeless face
I feel a fresher air around ,
Where no joy dies till love hath gotten more .
One bliss i can not leave behind :
When thy wisdom calls for fighting ;
That lay in the house that jack built .
Was spent in vain . so many hands had joined
And in my strength to feel me ever weak ;
But the trumpet of glory will wake it .
Answered in the words which follow :
They reached the city , and with mourning sore
That makes matters worse again .
Now here their sweetness through my room unfolding ,
Till they to number and fixed rules were brought .
To dance , would form an universe of dust :
And the red horse snuffed thrice into the wind ,
Will twine its thoughts and weave its doom ,
Yet neither spoiled himself , nor broke a bone :
And , wondering how their rage was borne ,
But no boy knows when he goes to sleep .
-- thus matters stood , nay he grew worse
Affection 's tribute while we life retain :
Were merged in nations , hold to that wide law
For it held you six times dear .
Our youth returned : for there was shed
The landscape lay in slumber 's chain ,
Hath laid her babe to rest ;
He fell upon the coveitise
What piercing music ! funeral visions rise ,
And a steamer softly puffing along the river passes ,
Tears standing in their eye ,
Reached not the heart that courage kept
Her soul went up on that lifted cloud
He of his riches would have made an end .
And all the penance the queen laid upon me
How soon my lucy 's race was run !
No sweeter hour will bring to thee the day .
To see life bodily and see it brave .
With limbs refreshed , and kept a swinging pace
His birth deriving from a mortal dame :
In that small shop he found a vicious youth ,
Flashed rushing silver , vines and vines and vines
And left them in chaotic state
Was once a man , who driven by evil tongues
Taste always twice , nor feel them cloy ,
Their bows dark shadows cast .
The sounds that say the wind is changing .
In sin for ever lost from life ; this act
Thou his image ever see ,
That stirring air that peals on high ,
The flush of transport stole .
Bring home the flag of victory .
Ere my strained chords return a faltering sound ,
Shifts the gloomy scene once more ,
And noon still heaves beneath this sun ,
Shall clasp a realm where never sets the sun :
But nobler subjects claim the poet 's lays ,
Mastered his soul till its fear was flown ;
That night went dancing in a ring ,
Never again to warm his dead , sweet body ,
Came the great teutonic order ,
Above alle othre that men finde
To the utmost peril in that battle brought ;
And those three apples on the steps that lay .
Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief ,
Hammered by the sun 's sweet maidens ,
' summer 's come , summer 's come ! '
Have passed it in my sleep .
Unto her words give heed .
Having lost the fair discovery of her way .
Each striking scene through which i 've passed .
Within our shaken hearts the air of passion ,
At hector ’s feet the gory visage lay .
Which the law 's triumphs might employ ; --
Who felt that christ indeed had risen again .
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave .
The fiend with ram-like bleating stirred :
The angry horns of discord blew
Christ is born to set us free ! "
As old time makes these decay ,
From the springs arise in beauty ,
A promise the youth gave which bore
Sparkle , until they dipt below the downs .
Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
The flames that it has lit .
By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe :
In every beam that fills the day ;
Of disobedience ; firm they might have stood ,
Five score thousand of sarrazins they take ;
His hand to make him out of joy and moan
Sweet lips , if love could fill ;
And fighting hard against his fate .
Pleas 'd _ satan _ somewhat nearer drew ,
Corruption and art such a picture did draw ,
He so young , to see it rise ! )
Some men there are who find in nature all
-- to forge again the chains of slavery
To see the life of genius smile
The vanguard of the armies lead :
Bright eyes , the violet waking , lifted up
It shows how soon all greatness is unmade
He felt his little soul on fire .
My soul had entered in the clay ,
This is time to break with slumber ,
Along her veins the quickened fires now run ;
Yea , work till death you see .
Or had the god of war inclined his eyes ,
To turn these forces from this present war ,
His friends were summoned on a point so nice ,
Where savage lurked and wild beast made
The path that leads , where , hung sublime ,
She sits a widow who sat as queen ,
Now dark -- now glittering -- now reflecting gloom --
Sweet poison to the evil self shall give ,
The eternal eye that sees the whole
To light us to freedom and glory again !
And grind the poets as i grind the players .
He gives justice without favor .
Hash made us worshippers , o claim thine own ;
Then , by my love from danger guarded ,
For we , that chased the summer 's smile
And all my soul ascends in prayer ,
Whether the name belong to pope or vernon ?
Whose smiles prevailed not for the frown of time .
The wind goes shivering with cold
Some love their minds with tales to feed ,
Still the bold defences stood ,
It suffers , yet it may not suffer wrong ,
And shed them round me while i sing :
The waves will roll again in dazzling ecstasy ,
Patriarchal nile rears at his watery stair ;
Swing and return to shift the sun anew .
Wife and mistress , and shared its woe ,
Who made it holy for his use alone .
Dark fate and fortune wreck not in their ire .
Make thy name a word of beauty ,
And wash the body whence the life has died ,
And their lives so cheaply sell !
Condemn 'd perhaps some foreign short to tread ;
And come next hour to look .
So the admiral he strikes with france 's blade ,
Around the wood , and let your sweet teeth sink
Is bearing on ; its issue wait ,
Take you your name , and take your legacy !
As for thy sake makes sorrow more divine :
High -- high as the snowsheds lie ,
To draw unto herself the love of man ,
The trees with summer 's thickest garlands crowned ,
A short way from the fight he reeled aside ,
Like arachne launched out on her thread .
Hung shadowing each sunny charm ;
With beauty shining through it ?
From the hoarse skies the wind replies :
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
And mortal like the flowers that round them smile ?
He show 'd himself as kind as mortal can .
Vapour adust doth never mount above
The finish none shall reach , unless he die .
To use their wakefulness when it returns . "
The tear and smile , that once together rose ,
The south , the priest presiding gained :
Or the wreck that struck last tide --
Putting the glamour on price or pawnee .
To hide the tears stood in her ee ;
Had taken the oath of fealty .
Above unsteady lamps , -- with black boughs flung
And the dawn to roses turns ?
With rage of battle seized his bow .
And now i feel its clasp upon my soul .
Thine earth now springs , mine fadeth ;
While the huge flower seemed of itself propelled ,
How i wished i her grief could assuage !
More than herself , that was so quickly caught .
Whom hawthorne has immortal made .
Where nature spreads luve 's crimson bed ,
Are moved by offerings , vows , and sacrifice ;
To lower sails and gather in the lines ;
Which held the alternate brass and silver rings .
That in my heart has taken root ;
There underneath , not made by torments sad ,
Innocence like music followed all the way ,
God gave her strength life 's bitter cup
For the loved who are circling around thee ,
So hardie as to proffer or accept
The enemy , tho ' strongly posted found ,
And give the nations to the waste of war .
To set our spirits singing ,
And in his waters , which your mirror make ,
This very heresy , perchance , may serve
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds .
Our nation 's warships lay .
Though he dwelt on the message it bore
Crystal fountains , coolness flinging ,
There rolled a crystal brook with gentle roar ,
How shall i tell the measure of my love ?
Which borrow 'd from this holy fire of love ,
The soil beneath , helping to hold it there ,
He that would break it , shall we trust
Where the rainless clouds stretch furthest ,
To my sage counsel therefore did i turn .
Feel the strict bonds of discipline .
And cruel , armed with death !
Vernal delight and joy , able to drive
Shone a fixed star of loyal love and duty
Keenly feels the pangs of torture ,
Pray that her faith preserve her : the event
Pedro rionda ’s heart stood still ,
Respite to memory , gave fresh play to thought ;
Tasks as futile does earth to its denizens give .
There , hermes treads the skies ;
The tall trees wave their green-gold hair .
That for years have called to prayer ,
That i may pass in patience still speak :
Their gates wide open threw .
For casting grief and care away ,
That sent him for the interview .
Which to almighty jove lame vulcan brought
Now backward must our story go awhile
And horse bore about them the signs of disaster ,
" did your own conscience never whisper you
A thrush made gladness musical
Before them death with shrieks directs their way ,
Hither had strayed , while from the frost i fend
And every joy he sends me comes
Long hid my thought had lain ,
As a child when past it going ,
A mighty raft the brothers made .
Which first love traced ;
I feel my heart with mingled music fill .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Fly quickly , hours that intervene !
And carnal lust ignited sallies
The low ebb-tide withdrawn ,
Damascus boasted , while in cairo shone
Your toiling brought . i spoke to you
Take heed , that in thy verse
Give the offender fitting ward .
For art to make into melody !
Through the land where the dead dreams go .
Or questing traveller with confusèd tread ,
Princedoms and peoples rise and flash and perish
As owls attack their heedless prey .
The crowd shrinks back from corey in horror .
And lead a life of smiling peace .
But we no holy fire have caught -
It was left for the rebels ' learning ,
For days went by . and , oft delayed ,
Nature in the shade had placed thee
And the three , taking that for my reply ,
And what successes it had whittled out ;
The skull and bones he made his sign ;
The pleasant hues that o'er it run ,
Reviens ! break away from those circes ,
Her shadows make soft caverns in the downs ;
The velvet down that spreads his cheek ;
And sword of temporal power to serve them .
That crowned the awful place , and then i saw
That covered the hours ,
That took my man and my lad from me ;
They follow with rapt spirit . and i weave
And some inscription ran along the front ,
For the treasure that lies in the quivering blue .
But not by sea again would take his way .
The strong domestic affections of the poet are prominently shown
Thy thirst , which from the triple question rose .
From signild ’s cheek faded the beautiful red .
Thou plaguest with the notion that the gods ,
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt ,
To cast discretion far behind ,
Its pulse with youth beat high ;
Of hope , that makes me tremble ,
To bless the turf that wraps their clay ;
The sound and sight have made her calm , --
At which they weeping came , nor uttering sound .
Within you , fell in calm so sweet
Thy dissolution brings , that in my soul
And chased the clouds and brought the sun again .
The moon has waxed fierce and waned dim :
Dares into judgment call her judge . -- supreme !
On whom be peace ! would have dealt presently
The wild hungry longing left me ,
All which makes other women noted fair ,
That influence had to me been given
Lest my heart be broken at the image
She patted all the world ; old empires peep 'd
Where love could soothe or save ,
When the wounded spirit is hard to bear ,
Than the strains our hearts are raising ,
The zephyrs waft thy fragrance , and it takes
The streams went singing to the sea ,
The goal he aims at . patience is a plant
Their batteries thundered on palace and dome ,
So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate ,
To grasp the beauty of the infinite ;
Then , as if struck by lightning , vanished all
As painters falsely draw him , blind .
And wrought by art in such a wise
The tidings home to bear .
The power of princes rests in the consent
Drew nearer , how our downward course we wound .
Harpstrings now a rousing air went . _
As fits the holy christmas birth ,
' enemy holding the line ahead ,
To pour his wrath on yon luxurious prey ;
That lit his world with love 's exalted grace .
Pays the last tribute of a saint to heaven .
Across his lips there came a smile ,
Some brownies ' round a cottage drew .
Well may true liberty be found ,
Would sicken , but she leans on thee ,
He should make his journey homeward .
Then , broken with terror and bruised with flight .
" and next came on the lovely rose ,
If we can keep the rules he gave
And away they bore from land .
The sun went down , and the dark after it
Like homing swallows they swept around me ;
That birds wrought on a vase can never reach .
The potamus can never reach
Where the sea and the sky seem closing together ,
Once while the brownies lay at ease
It sank with piteous yelp , resurged
A brighter morrow shall gay thoughts inspire .
I wish to dwell around your daylight dreams ,
And bitterer was the grief devoured alone .
Which they through wrath , or through revenge pursue ;
Is coming on , the sun has taken flight ,
As made the others grieve ;
Through which came flowing , flowing , flowing ,
The armies took , with songs and shouts ,
But all a solemn fast there kept :
Or the steep walls obstructed , round them cast
And driving snow , the cottage shut the door .
Of the steps that we took to one fiddle ,
Vernal delight and joy , able to drive
Thus bharat sadly made reply :
Something they lost , so many centuries gone ,
Like the crystal waters flowing .
And spread our commerce round the globe
And lightnings split the masts aloft ,
That warmth and fragrance weigh each bough ?
What spacious days his song recalls ,
For through that frame the ivied arches make ,
A deep cold settled aspect nought can shake ,
I felt as one might feel who should behold
Yet called on mirth to help his comrades bear
But on your eyes hard films there lay ;
For fame to thee has come unsought ,
Till they gaze on naught but bliss .
Ashore after billows have leaped .
The scent of roses , fainting sweet ,
And leads me onward to the better life !
His lips and fangs ran blood .
Each sun with the worlds that round him roll ,
Till lovers go blind and sway with me ? --
And favour where it stands with right ,
To sing what slaughter manly turnus made ,
To the poor boy misfortune that fatal journey bore ;
The drives from liberal shoulders poured ,
Lights pale october on his way ,
And , embarrassed , cast his eyes down
In the god 's beauty we no longer find :
Where sire and ancestors have led ?
Making the heart sicken o'er to win
For like her limbs thy branches show , —
Perhaps this name is given because of the sweet sound
And a little of this religion came in handy .
Beyond the land where leichhardt went ,
As wind and fortune ordered it , was bound :
Nor how it makes the sudden lilies push
Went the hunt 's gallop . godsdown wood
The city ' of grief encompasses , which now
Let take anon this constantine
Then up she took her little crook ,
Let ev'ry heart its own responses give ,
That camelot lay close to fairyland ,
Effect after dinner , and seemed to suggest a
That came in neptune 's plea .
The grief he could not hide .
From the isle of pain no breeze is sent .
Makes me doubt if heaven will gather
And shook it forth with a royal will .
Another rock will yield you passage safe .
Thou ' rt hedged with visions of despair ,
With his name bid the infamous treaty appear ,
As many vests , as many mantles told ,
The chain that holds though mountains be removed ,
Before me truth can stand alone ,
What wealth the show to me had brought :
There wave-like clouds by clouds were chased ,
Hither to me , o shrouded fates !
While all its hundred branches stretching round ,
Harsh trebles follow as a roaring bull ,
No words to waste that day ! --
He soothed and found munificent ;
That whet the edge of appetite afresh .
And brought to public mind what might result
That made her mother live before his sight ,
What harm , undone ? deep harm to disobey ,
The wind that sang them all his stormy story
Till the distant mountains answered ,
You have the face that suits a woman
For comfort when their sorrows burn .
And anchor cast amid the steadfast land .
Our hearts , our brains descend from these . '
Though he take the road that 's darkest . "
Where low in death thy father lies .
White sails lean along the waves leaping green .
Rations exchanged with flavour for the adept :
When awful beauty joins with all her charms --
Gems than those two that went before :
All other meanes of comfort comes too late .
Amastrus next is added to the slain :
With sorrows bear it down .
Chips flicked his sketch with little scraps of wood ,
Forth issued blood and soul , and from his sell
Dark on her soul a night of anguish fell ;
Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky ?
I still regarded thee as sprung from god ;
Her round white shoulder shaken with her sobs ,
A world of strife shut out ,
Might come one atom out of ispahan ,
Death is a chorded music , softly going
Making our little lives seem sad and lonely ,
't is passing wonderful that they ,
The knight 's loud laughter then succeeded , --
That weight his pack , will carry diamonds long .
Raised by his toil a cottage stood
Discover 'd what the errand meant ,
No wave his treasure from his grasp had riven
Of hotter months , that bring
Shall leave no vestige of this flower .
He cast into the forge , then , settling firm
From living tombs where every hope seemed lost --
Let us pass the night together ,
And to the tomb where pity lies ,
As in scripture truths we find ,
It was seen to that he was buried .
In the music a bear could make ?
And freely the wild song of gratitude weave thee ,
My heart upon his warm heart lies ,
I know the thunder has not ceased to roll ,
To kindle the clear flame of your strong soul
Sung by some knight in days gone overlong ,
The laughing flowers that round them blow ,
To those whom nature taught to think and feel ,
That took the soul with loveliness ,
Could raise the breath of song sublime ,
The precious pain of arms that held me fast .
Strange voices issued from her husband 's tomb ;
When love such wondrous fortunes planned ;
Aware that death may meet them on that day ;
Or wealth of love to bring ?
Renews the assault ; now fain would batter down
Loud rush the trumpets bursting through the throng
Which from the eternal fountain are diffused .
Whence nature views her loveliness displayed
In such a place to shed our tears ;
Will turn out to their credit , who believe
As the silvery tones came floating down ,
Ye hate what made him mourn .
And lay the spirit of a wife ,
That fills the place where she should be ;
Amidst their strokes the poet gets no harm :
As vicious strokes delivered well ,
The past to explore , the future to reveal .
Enough , the lesson has been given :
But there came no other answer
The soft wind waved my hair ;
Drink , and drown the world in pleasure !
Disease , and sorrow 's weeping train ,
Ever the wild malignant poised and panted to slay .
Nor see the dangers that around thee lie ,
There came one drop of giant rain ,
Thou , whose light folly bears the blame ,
And listening armies catch the godlike fire .
And thus the giant band addressed .
At length they 'll meet with fiery power ,
His measured span of sweet life wore away .
The star gave out its rays :
Thy letter 's first requirement meets me here .
Bear fleeting memories , that come and go ;
Lo ! it led to the realm god selected
Putting forth my utmost efforts ,
Hath the sun forgot its brightness ,
They wearied and their pleasure found an end ,
Across the country . when tall towers lay
And will lift the shade of gloom ,
Who , to appearance , had a fortune made .
To lead my willing mother upwardly
Through life goes joy , exchanging joy with all .
While pain and sorrow stand and reap !
Fro this day forth to take reste ,
And no proud honour to thyself redounds .
Like blossoms out to me that sat alone !
The paths that round it pass .
To delia 's ear the tender notes convey .
Veils pass , and laughing fellowship glows warm .
And those that turn the gospel into gold ;
Had snatched from light to form a star ,
Each gleam of clearer brightness shed to aid
Old occleve turned to lion . lion moved
A fever naught but death can slake .
Men in their loose unguarded hours they take ,
And has laid him down to slumber ,
Some far age may honour then
The soul goes out alone
On faces fallen of men that take no light ,
And the same love that first descended there ,
When all is fled that life can give "
His reeking head fell low ,
Was ended , laboured to avert the blow ;
Earth would have been too much , i see ,
As leads the galaxy from pole to pole ,
The dying sunset kindled through a cleft :
To follow after and to make a vow , --
And drew the flock behind him , too ,
As one whose road winds upward turns his face
As if to show his intellect ,
Thou hast come down our darkness to illume :
Through bondage vile , binding my freedom short ,
Which sends , and swallows up ; treasure of worlds
Like emeralds chased in gold .
And strangers led astray .
Since honor commands me , how can i refuse ?
And see herself only as theodore 's wife .
So is the emperor 's mandate traced , " --
In guise that skilful surgeon tries his ground ,
That carries us o'er the sea ,
I never found so true a democrat .
And ugly death upon his forehead stood ;
The evening came , the sun descended ,
I bid your wandering footsteps me to follow ,
The doctrines of the gospel , were unveiled ,
Around which bees made sleepy hum ,
Become whatever good you see ,
They added graceful necks , white hands and arms .
Of diamond sparks , which cast a light ,
To touch the tempting treasures where they lay .
That brings office and great honours ,
Though the whole world sings of hopes death chilled ,
That speaks the counsel of a fool .
Casket-breasts they give , nor hide ,
And his heart within him fluttered ,
It were right to shed tears of blood .
As that of nature moves the world about ;
Was put at last in execution .
And so for the sorrow his soul endured ,
Let us make music by mountain and sea ;
But they proceed in angry fray --
So that of both one counsel sole i made .
To deeds , as mighty magnets play .
Thus she inquired , and answer short he gave ,
One wild cry she gave despairing ,
The ascending sunbeams mark the day 's decrease .
Gone , gone are rapture 's flooding gushes !
And the peaks looked toward god alone .
She leaves her dancers lonely and lies there
Has brought fair flowers to make an earthly paradise .
Pour damp odours where they pass ,
Though the hawk with wings extended
To knightly levels lifts the slave .
And she swifter springs to the rising seas ,
How can it rise in filial prayer ?
The wainscotings begin to go ,
Whose soul has left its temporal case ;
Man , like the generous vine , supported lives ;
And all those labourers of the gospel shows ,
Had gone to war and served and ended it ,
That none to help her grief was found
When luckily came by a third --
And turns his studious hours to active ends ;
The tumult and the shouting dies --
The superficial scorn that says " you fool ! "
Comfort and counsel ; cooled the fevered brow
Such things as these cassandra did relate .
The moonlight shines on the straight column of water ,
Rich spoils and gifts that blazed against the day .
The steeples swam in amethyst ,
Sad was the hour when down from where it hung
From out the lattice came .
Marks where her brazen chariot rolled ;
Said i , as off to sleep i went ,
" no farther seek his merits to disclose ,
And cards were dropped from hands of listless leisure
To know what secret grief had made me sad .
Small difference lies between thy creed and mine ;
Where night and desolation ever frown .
Where fate and smiling fortune shew the way ,
Like shadows waited . my lord , sir hugh ,
The monarch frowned , by passion moved
Captivity led captive through the air ,
And the breathless land is lying in a swoon ,
A summer of green sorrows gathering ,
Or summer came to lull thine april song ,
And the little child made answer :
A shelter till the daylight broke .
But only the glorious organ 's sacred pealing
The meanest cup that touched his lips was
Since first , when conquering york arose ,
With still tears showering and averted face ,
And swept at last into the nameless void --
Nor that strange merriment once stops or stays ,
For owners when a column passed ;
And there dies slowly throbbing like a wounded bird .
On their tracks his eyes were fastened ,
Her glorious fancies come from far ,
And grind the poets as i grind the players .
And love the only lethe left to man .
Such intercourse as man with woman holds .
For who could credence give to that mad tale
Depart , and the silver thread that streaked
The warm night had the lingering buds disclosed ,
High on the shore the growing hill we raise ,
One is racked with wasting pain ,
I made excuse for the delay ,
We turn our prow , and reach the barren isles
Hard the task imposed ;
And slakes his thirst with streaming blood .
That stands all fame beyond ,
While bending nations to that monarch bring
From glaramara southward came the voice :
He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale ,
The dead despondency of those sunk eyes ,
Trees mounted , and trees drooped , and trees
The hills in their old order ranged .
An ear that waits to catch
Cauld blew the bitter-biting north
Such words fulfil their prophecy , and lack
Albeit a theme of flame to bring them straight
No answer came , but faint and forlorn
Which friendship could bestow --
My shrivelled wings were beaten ,
White teeth make light thereof ;
Like powerful armies trenching at a town ,
“ who great achilles brought the greeks to join ?
Singing she goes with the calm face of ruth .
Was drawn , hid in that pearly galaxy
That you still are standing true ,
Who met in heaven the irreparable mischance .
So little time could so much alter one !
While deep response from earth 's own mountains ran ,
No tyrant 's mandates echo from this wall ,
But memory failed : the chords and discords climbed
Christmas comes but once a year .
Divides his kingdom , and makes a prey ,
When dusky evening had embrown 'd the shore .
But from the pagan ran whole streams of blood ,
And stubborn justice holds her course .
Whose soul is still prepared for death --
Neither prose nor drama can attain poetic intensity save by
" lash him ! " -- a hundred lashes plow
She shall set her mouth to his mouth !
And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul .
No coward was in this last battle found ,
May thy billows roll ashore
Dizzy with stars , his mortal fever ran :
Love they make a poor blind child ,
And mists that spread the flying shroud ;
Thy pines give shelter to his bands ,
Who is the king you hold so great ? --
The dew fell fresh , the sun rose mild ,
Then on it runs like trailing vine ,
The passionate teeming plays this curtain hid ! )
And easter sunday gleamed upon the sky ;
For want of what it may not claim .
To execute the vengeance of its wrath .
Where the long street of lifted steeples lies .
How liquidly the oil of flattery flows !
At dawn the snow lies in unsullied whiteness ,
With sweet infusion , and put you in mind
None whom song has made her stars .
Of melody , that seems to roll
Our friend jemmy rivington made it an eden --
Or come sad tidings from our native land ?
And but little time passed over ,
And find no shade but from the cypress tree .
He brings the happy days of old ,
Grief seized and anguish , at those tidings , all
Who saw them live , who felt them die ,
Seeking and finding the battle 's brunt .
Never was scene so formed for love !
The strength a great soul wore --
To give in fame what fate denied in years .
Oh , then i feel those tears my own ,
“ nor sees he scandalizes too the fame
Will help our cross to bear .
And new-born pleasure brings to happier men ;
Notes to swell the songs of gladness .
While i draw this fleeting breath ,
And heavenly charms prefer to proffer ’d gold ?
The feeble sons of pleasure set their hand ;
This morning led thee to king harold 's grave .
Sleep comes to chloroform the fretting mind .
Whose arms stretch to his playmate .
Our claim to feed upon immortal truth ,
A wave to pant beneath thy power , and share
I mean to take to writing it myself !
Since from thy tomb a thousand heroes rise !
With high conceit and feeds his fainting wit .
With cruel fangs their tortured limbs to grind .
Yet making thy home-coming all complete ,
Even now the sands are running in the glass ;
Can heal or hurt thee .
As evening comes to take his place ;
With scream that cut life through ,
Stirs my being . blind passion is only the weed
Through me you pass into eternal pain :
Or i can foreign treaties dish up .
The justest reasons to support his prayer .
Of reticent withdrawal 's sweet , courted pale ,
The archbishop gives the signal for the fight ;
That ate follow him and claim her dues .
Thy worn-out heart will break at last ,
And here they laid her beautiful and pure ,
And culverins which france had given .
Now stand the troops within the captured town ,
Should thy bloody teeth feel hunger ,
Shall molder to dust and together shall lie .
Under which the bright sea heaves ;
A wandering spark of fire ,
My court i hold with singing ,
As first have made him see
I plucked the joys upon her lips ;
A flint which never made for mark and missed ,
Which followed nestor to the god-built burg
To and fro there stirred a spark .
Even now i see it flowing in my dream ,
By a glad heart made radiant . she was full
The furies plunged in the infernal lake :
That haunts or makes one weep .
Still hovers the spirit of grief round her tomb ;
All realms of knowledge owned the mastering will
Only by its prevailing over pain .
Is by the rumour moved to see the pair .
Such proofs i 'll bring as never man before
And feared the frost would nip it .
Of doubt closed round him . was there any man
" leave thee alone to bear such wrongs !
A woman who could bend to grief ,
But grim death now shakes his dart ;
They nodded drowsily and heaved in sleep .
They form a deed more odious and accursed ;
But that the lion 's race was run ,
The gaze lingered on it , for eros had set
King louis ' court to impotence made plea
Devotedly by heaven seems cast ,
And , wrapped within their flame , they now repent
Didst thou the land of knowledge find .
Left man the only beast to prey on man .
There will your mind be drilled and braced ,
Those beauties bright as tulips blown ,
A spacious garden lay , fenced all around ,
“ nor herbs thy garden feeds with mellow juice ,
That swung and swooned and panted in mad sighs ;
When , gathering that the debt is lightly deemed ,
Filled with the voice of praise and prayer :
With such persuasions occupied , they fought .
That holy homage which is felt
Once shorn as an offering to passionate love --
And her thoughts ran on as follow :
Nor yet when summer glows
As along _ cheap _ his way he took ,
Which reason tells me to reveal .
Who fears to plow the atlantic wave ,
What still and chilling sternness great cliffs keep !
The nations shall take note . his unripe age
They come by paths the martyrs trod ,
And hisses with the wind that is escaping ;
Like the black-earth made my visage ,
His nature with her shivering faith ran yoked .
Signification marvellous she caught ,
By its perfection , where their weakness lay .
Love calls to war :
To the floor it hangs in beauty ,
The maniac 's rushing frenzy to reprove ,
( the worth of birth it surely teaches ! )
Came the spring , and all the forest
Are breaking in the poppies that they bring .
Some say the beggar 's looking for a wife .
Who swept the loud chords of a lyre ;
They can not kill the ache , the ache .
The ghosts that crowd about life 's empty day .
But leave the gen ' rous mind to guess .
From distant mountains catch the flying joy ,
In winter wither , only to reveal
Piled upon rotten doctrines , baseless forms ,
And sorrow 's piercing dart .
In the dim glass the demons hold ,
Ah ! matt , old age has brought to me
Whatever passed in rooms in years gone by ;
That issued from your hands to perfect day ,
The lady said as much as breath will bear ;
Drops of compassion tremble on my eyelids ,
The well of wisdom sinks in hell 's abode ;
They have never seen the sunshine , nor the glory
Winged like a bird to cleave its way
But train my soul to lead a line --
Christ will soon " make all things new ; "
There came to me then no stony vision
Like glorious freedom , as her hopes expand ;
Dash into poetry , which is but passion ,
Cannon-balls that ask not whom they strike !
To save thy secret soul from nightly fears ,
Strength within my heart shall keep ;
Their souls with fire of faith that helped them build
When love himself draws near ;
Took the way unto the jail .
In the dark hole sit rooting up of books .
Nor yet quite deserted , though lonely extended ,
Behind the army followed , all
That can touch the strings in concord . "
“ this verse repeated , instant heaven grew dark ,
The night came on alone ;
And man and art with nature fused again .
Each sailor to his love went on ;
Whose voice comes as the voice of an only child
Peace for mine own self i could never find ,
Cloud left the stars .
And the smile which is sweet will surely find
The hands that cling and the feet that follow ,
The winds to heaven the curling vapours bore .
It reaches the haven through tears .
Eternal buckle takes in parian stone .
Upon her head -- " this faith was shown
My few months ' joy over and spent ,
" with open freedom little tyrants raged . "
And deem 'd that fallen worship far more dear
The hills lay basking in the purple sky ;
Through which her eerie pathway lay .
The priests who call upon thy name are slain ,
" fare well " meant long ago , before
The willows glow , the scarlet bushes burn ,
Where the winds can never find them ,
“ the seventh night has come and fled
Finds happiness unblighted , or if found ,
With changed looks where wrath and anger met ,
Firing his oaths about like vicious shots ,
Ere his tongue spoke , to learn his thought ,
With light united , day they give ,
And round the corner came the hunt ,
That heart has lost its lone ;
But the forts still stood ... . their breath
Could find no haven half so sweet
And come at once to that affecting scene --
Through bronzed lyre in tragic order go ,
By driving winds the crackling flames are borne ; "
Quickly leaping from his captor ,
And traced the long records of lunar years .
Columbia gave him birth . him genius most
Of lights that from some cavern stole away .
Who were wisely formed by kalim :
When sweet airs come seaward
And other flowers , lay upon
Of flint , went boldly to the fray ;
But , torn by paynim hatred ,
Thus addressed the ancient louhi :
" i bore my load alone ; i crept
Fearless to arms you sprang
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Should dim the glories that i moved among
For slow and slow that ship will go ,
Confederate crowns , this warfare brings ;
Just as the sun rose above the foam ;
The soul of the river had entered my soul ,
A little town stood on the level sand .
Forth went shingebis , the diver ,
From life to life salvation glean ;
All sounds of life assumed one tune of love .
To seek for wealth and seek for power .
Fu ' lifted up wi ' hebrew lore ,
There ruddy warmth will make our faces glow ,
You will discover how much you care ,
Yet scarce had reached the margin , when he saw
Aeneas , bore him high above the ground .
Buildings monstrous which brush the skies !
Where ghastly horror fills the dreary vale ,
Shall fragrant odours still be shed .
Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant 's power .
" what trust can bring to life again ?
And left his throne to track the weary feet .
How can i make it holy in his sight ?
And turn to blessings watched by heaven !
The great , sad sacrifice was made
For costly clothing makes us poor .
Anon , a gentle word would turn the scale --
The sacred fillet of his god he bore ,
And turn me from that fading shine ,
" that should have given forth fruit .
Our simple statesman found his rule
And fill 'd with frenzy like the men of old
Two moons of hopeless woe remain ,
From error here is almost sure to flow !
To peer into the visible profound ,
Count nothing criminal that works thy will !
That dims the greying end of night ;
Caused them from wisdom 's paths to stray ,
And his gold in my strong chest shall lie .
Who soon its walls could batter down ,
Could lift his eyes unto him in that fight ,
Of that nature , soothed and gentled ,
Without one common trait which kinship shows
Should rage so fiercely round me in its wrath ;
There passed a youth , who still was heard
Let me awhile be twisted in thy shine ,
To house the profit that arrives ;
The timeless wonder faced ,
Are thus deceived and fall away from grace !
How could the wretches help but marching on ,
One watch remained the night to close
Years twice twenty had come and passed
Which noted token of the woodland war
Death waits his hour , nor takes me now :
The great eurytian when this frenzy stung ,
When death 's unvexed repose gets hold on man
So passed she mourning forth . but he ,
Who tread their native soil as native slaves ,
Yea , and drain the blood which runs
Splice -- to join in holy matrimony .
He gives a dribbling to the poor ;
And love by jealousy to madness wrought .
Then hector , to his bands retreating , sprang
And our drums beat the notes of salute .
With their everlasting fences stretching out across the land !
That will spur to the devil upon us .
Till autumn 's mellowing reign appear .
To break the blast of winter , stand ;
Which gave you birth gave me this sight ,
Within a valley deep this forest stood ,
With the bold comet , take my bolder flight ,
Stood speechless ; such remorse the words infuse .
That lit me off to rou ' tor town
Must many primal germs be stirred in us
_ or set sorrow in our way ? _
And find with rage , regret , despair ,
Near as he draws , thick harbingers of smoke
Nor tongue nor pen can show ;
So little justice here he found ,
From the renown 'd achilles , and it fell
Of battle , framed in glory ,
To heaven whence first it came .
Whose wall the silent water laves .
By self-deprecation sways her :
His silence is a music heard
Or like the snow when summer 's come ,
Fair to the eye , inviting to the taste ,
She quenched the lamplight 's yellow gleam ;
But springtime come a-courtin '
His boyhood found the waters clean ,
To that fighter rollant my challenge threw ,
Thou that giveth warmth and comfort ,
Nature , abashed , thus made reply :
Of the wild ocean from his locks express 'd .
No fear of his deliverance now remains ,
The purple twilight stole above
Which made me greedy of embracing them .
Clearer thy pure song came
" they moved ' gainst the monarch
The mighty baptist that way marks the line
What follows next in order ?
Is drawn by mutual piety
The aspiration of my youth , to build
And all found lesser than i was .
Wisdom , whereby the heavens were made
And the mouldering dust that years have made
Not yet half quenched . the sacred steel
The adjustment long so vainly sought .
I wonder how the rich may feel , --
Had come of many a grip in mastery ,
Where mississippi flows afar ,
He could bear witness now and cleanse their eyes .
The time admits not flowers or leaves
A strange light on the chamber plays
Nor take before its term thy life ,
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now ,
His fair face turned to the tender skies ,
Or blackens hell , which gave it birth ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Yet in this breast doth courage still remain ;
And make thy great knees tremble ; i will send
To me alone there came a thought of grief :
Ay , jetted such brave fire that they ,
When came the time of wooing , yes .
Its term of life was nearly closed ,
A cup . there stand the quiet hills .
The night is past , is past and gone ,
Like some mild lambent flame the passion plays ;
My love and fortune first did run ;
These are the virtues , tim , that draw
You put such folly in our heads
No burglar fixed his dread abode
As made the valiant lift them to the gods ,
Through driving mists i seemed to see
Put so much of his heart into his act ,
And rosy lips that knew no guile ,
Set up against fear .
This said religion was a friar ,
They make soft music -- yet it 's true
And utterly consumed with sharp distress ,
His buckler in the cruel shock is broke .
Romance that our morning hearts could see
That man will never frame a noble treat ,
Let his great acts the verse inspire ,
Voluptuous july held her lover , earth ,
Love gives it energy , love gave it birth .
Not harshly thundered forth or rudely pressed ,
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;
Colours go and colours come .
And mortals lead astray .
That shaped her sorrow , rocks and pools ,
He cast it down into that deep abyss .
Upon the meadows settles shimmering down
And shook it forth with a royal will .
Deep in her eyes there gathered the black fury ,
One after one the stars have risen and set ,
Homeward again winona took her way .
With his war-club smote the doorways ,
Beauty through my senses stole ;
It sets the blossoms flickering white .
And feel that your heart is mine still ;
And rifted rocks whose entrance leads to hell ;
Danced to conceal a breaking heart .
Those who seek to curb the mind
His smile when rang their proud hurrah ,
Such noise as i can make to be heard farthest
And with their terrors drest the magic scene .
Blind sepulchres that hold within their stones
And ever as she went , the image lay
Will see the standard of his soul unfurled ,
Fears never such structures shall rise on that spot !
A spark to burn for life was flown .
From my heart i give thee joy ! --
His song could fire the sailor on the wave ,
But time has made you dote , and vainly tell
Follow the rule to the uttermost letter :
Sunday clipt , sunday shorn ,
And laughing folly plagues no more .
Rapt poets spake out in his tone ;
His cap and coat are enough to note
While he took to teasing , and cruelly toze
And all that did then attend and follow ,
And hurried note , the song went on .
For all the love he gave .
Above ; such hatred in their hearts they bore
So far from them have i drifted .
There too he form 'd the likeness of a field
All this singing , that makes for such weariness ...
Dogged and grim they stood their ground ,
The human spirit with the brutal join 'd ,
When the bourbon lilies leapt and gleamed
Each tiny flake turned to a battle-ship ;
It burthen 'd me with thankfulness ,
Slowly the chiefs desert the blazing fane ,
Where millions lie lulled to their portioned sleep
And carry thee , farther than friends can pursue ,
The sun took delight
The flames would leap and then expire .
But his eyes they shine like lake-foam ,
Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish 'd me ;
Our hearts shall wake to know love 's golden head
Suddenly the golden night all with music rang .
The wagons silent standing take their nightly rest ,
Like them in tears it sets .
To find the precious morning hours were lost .
But god could make it precious fruit to yield ,
And found their cheer was of the very best .
At random drove , her helm of reason lost .
Humbled they stood ; pale horror seized on all ,
Be tasted ere it work ; the last exceeding
She quickly made his fickle purpose veer ;
The milk-weed came a-pouring ;
Years have swept , and years are sweeping
The murderers with savage purpose spared .
Next called to see the fair ;
Might make the conqueror tremble on his throne !
Enjoys what music fills the plaintive song ;
Her forces mixed of craft and passion urge
And the wretched council 's bosoms beat ,
The waves shiver , struck by the wind ;
My country 's spectre-monarch stood ,
And darkness joined with darkness . thus doth lie
Which pope renders thus : --
A girlish shape that slips the bud
And centuries have struggled toward its birth .
Slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet
Summer , with flowers that fell ;
Breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me .
The lovers stray together hand in hand ,
That free access should hence remain .
Of spring that breaks with all her leaves ,
That he may hear his fate divinely come .
His only praise attends the pious heir ;
Like roses ere they blow ;
Till at his second bidding darkness fled ,
Of man and time are mine , and spend themselves
What comfort johnny soon will bring ,
Even such became i at those proffered words ;
With wicker arks did come
And follow christ wherever he may lead :
A bare sky confronts an upturned face .
Which lets its own sorrow embitter its art .
The orphan found a home . her story known ,
" then the brother fell to weeping ,
And a courage that never will shirk ;
That i could wish in our converse might share .
Of lions , raging at their chains , the cries
The ceaseless fusillade of terror ran .
He saw her , and joy lit his face ,
Here to her eyes some tearful memory sprung ,
In full fresh cheeks i take the greatest satisfaction .
In paradise that beare delicious fruit
The mean observer , whom base safety keeps ,
That can expresse the life of things indeed .
The memory of ages quench 'd --
Or think or feel , awake , arise !
Perhaps prosperity becalmed his breast ,
Words can not tell how wonderful you were ,
Or ' round the yard their courage showed ,
And took it home to his own heart .
And sounds of woe along the groves were borne .
And know , divided soul of me ,
For love of her whom god led forth ,
And the word was passed to fight .
That hath kept watch o'er man 's mortality ;
The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife ,
Morning and evening opened and closed above me :
The waters babble as they run --
Tho ' power is given to us here ,
With double rage his bosom swelled .
My voice him to remembrance brought ;
As the hours died beneath that stifling pall .
The sapling draws its sustenance , and thrives ;
The young and the aged made haste to appear ;
Is given only to beguile ;
Loose , lazy arms in graceful movement tossed ,
When even hope thy soul aside shall cast ,
And light will come with day . "
A king might wish to hold in fee .
Can give the heart a cheerful hour
While the winter snow was lying ,
Wanted nothing but lemon to fill him with punch ;
To where his slighted garden lay ;
Just to relieve her spirits from dejection .
From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round
Would give its weight in diamonds for this hair ,
Then the two queens drew nigh to each other .
In growing happiness ? shall i throw by
Doth but inflame , and feed their thirst .
To mark the sweet flowers as they spring ;
Of france upon that day bore rueful loss ;
_ so fall the bravest of the christian name ,
Behold , it swims to thee ,
Was softened with all grace of scent and sound
Will fly the errand of our love to thee ,
One hand she press 'd upon that aching spot
April brings the primrose sweet ,
She goes all so softly
In pity for his fate , drew near .
And that remaining sage , to follow her .
To reach the pulsing heart that beats within ,
Unheard , unseen , three years her arts prevail ;
She pat but little faith in :
To meditate amongst decay , and stand
Despair and anguish from their victims flew ;
Here shines no golden roof , no ivory stair ,
Have paid chance tribute of their smiles and tears ;
Such angel bands attend his hands
To singing birds on earth was laid .
Damascus boasted , while in cairo shone
Into tears of sadness turning !
It will bring love 's visions nigh ,
Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize ,
The power of temptation to assail .
So there reposed the happy two :
She would turn a new side to her mortal ,
Beneath which ran an ample water 's tide ,
In hour of danger led the van .
For the love that would not stay .
This causeless melancholy that comes with rain ,
A presbyterian church went down ;
As i see my soul reflected in nature ,
Where he shall find not only rest , but balm
And our tears bathe his feet .
There came a blister on my heel --
Along the highway leading from the town .
And the lizards flirt and the swift snakes follow
His blood-stained soul did go .
That in thy sweets all sweets encloses ,
Through jacob 's race a chilling horror ran ,
And well he did enjoy the time thus spent .
He of the seraphim most absorbed in god ,
To shrinking realms announced her fatal fall ;
From the pierced pupil spouts the boiling blood ;
And felt the classics were not dead ,
Still the burden floated round me :
And tender green came peeping through ,
Contend that never hath it come to pass
I ca n't help thinking puberty assisted .
The gun 's fury mounting higher ....
Ere nature again her balmy dews send ,
" lovely maid , with rapture swelling ,
That rode the far and desert lands ;
Save when presumption shuts the ear of pride :
Where our last kiss still warms the air ,
Whereas it is noah , commanding the ark .
Transported touch ; here passion first i felt ,
Take flight and follow and find the sun .
While the sands o ' life shall run .
The soul aeolian took up the lyre
That less is felt than seen .
That none can make afraid .
We seek to grasp the truth , it quickly flies
Such physic , and so much to take ,
The tears stood in her eyes
They never feel the breezes blow
To ruin troy and set the world on flame ;
Her ancient glory passed as morning clouds ,
Till snows were gone , and spring again
Still wrestling with his soul to win it back
The knights to swear the oath now muster .
As if it came from guinevere ,
Went down a rope to say his prayers .
And boon of blossom gave ,
And once made perfect , never lost again .
And the warm maid confessed a mutual love .
The track made by st. francis is deserted .
Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad .
And him whose lips the sweet fruit hath made red
But ere it met the billow blue ,
And growing sound of kindly voices ,
Thou bring the old child-heartedness , --
Something still to do or bear .
So clear i see that i have sought
Carve every word before you let it fall ;
And often weeps , the story goes ,
And yet what a sadness she seems to conceal !
Between the banks which bear the vine ,
Would lose the pride , the taint of sin ,
Priests of unblemish 'd lives here make abode ,
Where a ' the tones o ' misery yell ,
The flesh never moved my heart --
And the pure skies with sacred feathers clift ;
The watchers saw it lifting white
His strength and skill he both did give ,
Come on — a distant war no longer wage ,
To mark the bride by partial father praised ,
And down a sable way runs silver light .
That nestled in your bosom till you died ;
The sage began new gods to form .
We draw the outlines of weird figures cast
Our pledge that liberty shall live .
They cast away the spleen and vapours
Old murders that made horrible the sea
That woke within the poet 's yearning breast ,
What sound hath made thy heart to fear ?
Walls and ceilings creaked and murmured .
As under the whip the horses go
White clouds chase each other .
Until the hour strikes what must come
That joined and made a sea ,
Strange lips that whisper till her own lips smile ,
Which way the wind might blow .
Draws from dull death his lost eurydice ,
The conflict knew no pause or stay .
Break thou the chains of earth , oh lord ,
Nurtured in tender soil , he held a path
And more he strove his grief increased the more ,
Northward she sinks , the nether seas embrace
And sprung to battle for the proud castile .
One knew not which gave forth the sound .
You bring back the happiest spirit from spain ,
Born to give truth to plato 's dream ,
Marry , do penance , and dismiss your fear .
If with his fathers he had fallen asleep ,
With dreadful bellowings , hurling all around
His battle signal shows !
She caught and kept his first vague flickering smile ,
Another 's art may shape the tone ,
And in thine ears the olden music rang ,
And left behind a smile which cheered
High in the sunlight his sabre he bore .
In pagan times , it drew its interpretation from
Then hurries back the road it came
I felt her pride of race ; her taste
Are those who looked to christ already come .
And the proud victor tore her wreathes away ,
Have tossed their toys in saddest disarray --
Then into his mind it entered
O thou ! whose fancies from afar are brought :
When age has surely come at last ?
The son of saturn pitying saw their grief ,
We see our happiness ;
The flames leapt leering at his side .
Of which a curious cradle they did make ,
Those headlong furious passions to confine ,
Unwonted , for traditions run ,
When drooping pleasure turns to grief ,
Next morn there came a bulky document ,
To bar and guard the ivory gate ,
The appetite remains , that this is ask 'd ,
Is this the justice which on earth we find ?
They saved the tears of innocence seduced
Till truth and right from violence be freed ,
And step for step they followed dancing ,
And the happy trees would throw
Where the cliffs abruptly stop ,
The broad stream bore her far away ,
Thy simple soul mounts up in worship
" and wake the echoes to sudden fright ,
With clematis , the barren womb whence sprung
And the red blaze ascends the blushing sky :
That man was made to mourn .
For heathen heart that puts her trust
And terrible fishes to seize my flesh ,
And airs that from thy painted fan respire .
Sweetheart , why foolish fears betray ?
Then will pure light around thy path be shed ,
That brought to nearer touch their crime itself
Interpreting the thing in nature meant ,
That heart that lo'ed me dearly !
_ creon . _ thy life shall surely pay
And over ruined fields the storm hath come . "
That made her sweet lips smile and say --
She cast herself before him on her knees ,
As autumn to winter resigns the pale year .
To seal the cause they held so dear ,
Which o'er thee on that evening fell ,
Seven spirits of wisdom like fire-tongues played .
I feel my sunk heart ache ;
Or hath death freed you from his ancient pain ?
The piper wind goes roaming
By which this sum of things recruited lives ,
Suspicious people , who find fault in haste ,
Their stomachs struck the dew-wet grass
With gratitude his heart did burn ,
He lays aside to find his dignity ;
How many leaders threw their lives away ?
His works will take eternity to know .
One pitying thought your dark soul does not own .
The helm brings valour to the failing heart --
Nor makes the hour one moment less .
And kept the country-side in fear ) ,
An ’ crying can not bring her back ;
To me , thoughts lived of old anew are born
Leads through a region wealthy grown and wise .
We 'll flash upon the milky way
Where yet thin fumes from dying sparks arise , }
And flowers of heaven by shining hands were flung !
Give thanks and praise to god always ,
I hitched the bronks an ' struck a gait
The fire which in the heart resides ;
Flowers expand their light and soul-like wings ,
As a star feels the sun and falters ,
Now i bring aback my true-love dear .
But the word of his message goes free . "
The other steeds in dire confusion threw ;
That leading cloud i follow 'd still ,
A magic fire drawn down from paradise ,
Albeit well used to loftier minstrelsy .
Such ambush hid among sweet flours and shades
Thy voice shall speak to old and young
From bondage releasing ,
Now came a ringing cry to march ; and cheers
That this rare grace came down from heaven above .
To the house that gave
They pass through the valley like virgins ,
His line stretched back unto its holy mount :
Such sounds as parted souls might love .
Be his whom she held dear ,
Nor force the smiles
Thou must haste and follow too ;
Beheld the glory , and what shrine it filled ,
Till the last address was made : --
" what ! wilt thou take mine honour quite away
That 's the way the gaelic goes --
Ask him how he chanced to find
A silver urn that full six measures held ,
To him who keeps most faith with thee .
Affection sound , and human passions quell .
The sacred tones that my soul embrace ,
The years have gone over with many a change ,
Writhed not at passed joy ?
Had not the monarch quickly stopt the fray .
There came another furious attack ,
And discords raised oft in disordered sort ,
That hailed my father 's fame ;
Thou his image ever see ,
Showed like a bird that turns to rest
Where my heart refused to follow . "
Many a fortune won us .
As dead to emotion -- exhausted , or broken !
That , virtue 's ends from vanity can raise ,
Full upon the crown it struck him ,
Where earth in chaos lay .
Reason shall steer , and skill disarm the gale .
Rise ! for the day is passing :
Riding the air and carrying all the time
And at her helm the master reason sit .
The bones of the outlawed viking may lie .
Sifting the nations ,
They their strength would there renew .
He from the gods this dreadful answer brought :
Waving away the worn-out creed of love
That waits on growth and action shall proceed
Beside his peers to raise the voice for freedom :
And dusk bound gold about her hair and hips :
Now hell 's terrors seize his soul ;
And with our former cause we kept the faith ,
Brightly thy soul in life 's fair morn arose ,
And loud his shout of triumph rang ,
Starboard and larboard bears the fitful gale ,
His blessed works can see !
The ploughman from the sun his season takes ;
And the air swung far and far between
And mists in spreading steams convey
The hero ne’er by terror stirred , —
And ev 'n the elements a tyrant swayed ?
When word came to the carline wife
Prelude of bloody fields , and fights to come !
And hence thy surname grew . i follow 'd then
What war could ravish , commerce could bestow ,
" hath sweetness stint or measure ?
He strake sir andrew through the brain .
If the worm may creep up to thy fellowship ,
" get thee another leader , charlemaine ,
And balen ’s heart within him shone
It is not meet that i should dare to judge
Then came the news and the tragic story :
Thy holy mysteries ; for i will chase
Lingers round her lips : -- you see
Through their fated foes . forth went wistan ,
Every one his strength applied ;
To see what my black hen doth lay .
Here stayed their talk ; for marmion
Your title is struck on a charming new letter :
Drawn by the cunning bait to certain doom .
All living things he struck with dread .
And shadow over the world came down .
Were nearing the secret of space and time ;
Excessive spirit , urged them to the course ;
Still sobbing in life 's trembling wires .
Wild warbling where the burnie gushes .
That strips the hills and sweeps the cowering plains .
Untamoinen bears the saying ,
Not mere tongues dividing , but soul from soul ,
To make them follow with the rest --
Unto what manner of manhood he hath grown !
Let the hands of ukko follow ,
Soft as those kind looks she gave me ;
Thine , though it never knew the summer heat ;
Life is a flame that flickers in the wind ,
Where the rugged winters frown
With forged lies he makes his tale so good ,
And the snows of the winter lay deep around ,
The winds have brought him a strange sound
Stands up and takes the morning : but in front
So lofty that i feel my brain turn round ,
Shall dwindle , shall blend ,
While her fan kept time to the swaying rhyme
Where i must stay , no joys are found ;
She dares invent the god in words confused ,
Doth from the vision , that reflects the scene .
Each varied form , his legions lead .
And go the way they choose .
Give birthday smiles , and walk in white array ?
To take it in his head to smite --
That killed that lovely pullet ,
Due honour paid to him , thy guest ,
Whose limbs leap light the vales along ,
Or was righteousness sold for handfuls of gold
Thee spend a sigh t ' accompany my tear .
And , ready now to spring his secret snare ,
And breezes will bring puffs of hawthorn scent
Thus gave defiance to the foe ,
One nice fine summer 's day went out
His counter , well content his gain to find
Now their swelling waves appease ;
And bloom there till the summer time is gone .
Her understanding all my meaning caught ,
Each rock rebellowed , and each forest rang ,
We turned , and eyes of mutual wonder raised ,
The mind to meditate on what it learns .
Ere home returning , filled with hope ,
At thy clear notes they used to come ,
A thousand treasures art and knowledge bring ;
Coiling itself , preparing to raise its head ,
Genius shall read its secret ere it flies ;
And lifts the trojan glory to the skies .
We reach the wrong when most we seek
He 'll help to get the victory ;
O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly ,
Nor can i miss the way , so strongly drawn
When the blunt speech brings grief and pain .
But when thou pours thy strong heart 's blood ,
Of hope the praises in this height resound .
And catch the burning sparks that fly
All are lost ! -- yet still they bear
I might regain your love with beauty born
Though the green fir trees rose up stark and still
But made me love her all the better .
The soul of music sings
And memory gild the past .
Into my bursting veins , the whole sea poured
The cradled waters stole the lullaby
Time moves behind her in a blind eclipse :
The painted angels stand .
Which made me both to weep and smile --
How wearily goes the creeping day .
So full of pain which blindly grows ,
What causes make the winter nights so long ,
And hasten where our lord shall lead .
Each godlike guess beheld the truth it sought ;
The city of our foe to reach
A song of bale and bitter sorrow sings ,
For the poor make no new friends ;
Nor beams the sun upon a better pair
And cast the ponderous burden at the door .
His course , for distant regions bending ,
An ' taxes of our food to raise 'em ,
And unto him for this was wisdom given .
Then be it as the laurel god he runs ,
Has left me to my misery ,
With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew :
To rise , and prove their innocence . --
And fresh-blown roses washed in dew ,
Till his ear drank with ecstasy
And waters moved beneath the heath and corn
Firm still stood , nor failed in valor ,
The gloomy clouds have passed away ,
Boot led our lofe hafe vings ;
Whatever comes from them , though in a shape
Life much , bent rather how i may be quit
Which found a throne upon a juliet 's tomb .
As at home the christmas day is breaking wan .
And not lay plans to drown yourself in drink ,
No mercenary bard his homage pays ;
Like poisoned scum upon the driving flood ,
Riches and luxury send up
And love without it runs in debt ! "
Space may produce new worlds ; whereof so rife
The fourth band led to battle , and the fifth
Would never lose their soft perfume ,
To feed the sorrowy signal for return ,
Her eyes are sapphires set in snow ,
Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls ,
Worthy of heaven and earth made one .
When joy becomes reality and not a glittering dream .
Does all italia observe my heart ,
And force but crush 'd what freedom vainly righted --
In the summer just passed over ,
Dimly in lowliest shapes revealed ;
And even when it dies , to pass
Path of advance ! -- but it leads
Whence all the dark dead centuries rose to bar
With music waiting on her steps ,
Where the spine joins it . not more furiously
Added to his connection with the sea ,
The woes of aeschylus resound prophetic ,
For a kingly presence is drawing near .
The tempest rushes through the sky ;
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice ,
She loved the youth she gazed upon .
He rose , -- and waved a proud farewell ,
And spent each moment spare
Dark clouds that o'er us spread ,
The crescent moon , that knew the sun ,
Which holds three persons in one substance knit .
The palm and may make country houses gay ,
New pictures to the mind may give .
Of sense and justice , run where frenzy drives ;
And learned bards of it their ditties made ;
The sun moves hither , leaving capricorn ;
Which make happy husbands and home loving sons
Was travelled , and held paris for a god
Their memory comes to chill the heart ,
All dismal fear relieved that eremite ,
We linger in pleasures that never are gone ;
The chain extending to a place of trust ;
Give way to the fruit .
Some of them softly catching afire ;
How still the dancer lies ,
Where none but elders laid their head ;
When sin their drowsy eyes had sealed ,
They showed us gleams of fame ;
Of thickening tumult rose around ,
And from the current came a cry ,
The muse alone unequal dealt her rage ,
My lips held fast the mouth o ' the world
All things at their greatness tremble .
On through his throat and shuddering nape it rushed :
Those looks of woe too clearly say
Quickly leaping from his captor ,
It made the violet flower ,
Then come alternate rapture and despair ;
The outlaws ' guns were lifted ,
Didst thou find place within the human heart ?
In a flame which again they throw
Scarce stir the branches . lodged in sunny cleft ,
There came a respite to her pain ,
The guarded fane where love alone may peer ,
Till the moon had long passed over .
And all his heart with joy was stirred .
They showed their hate as they should not have done
His teeth , as all the world allows ,
Fronting the day 's descent across green slopes ,
In point of death lies verily ;
And all the world points back and cries ,
The silence and the sun remain .
The vales redoubled to the hills , and they
Round saragossa his lines will close ;
When stricken hearts do suffer , yet not break ,
The blazing wonder from below surveys .
Unselfish and silent , it asks no return ,
Dash down the threatening swords and join the hands .
A king might wish to hold in fee .
Dishonoured in their death shall lie ,
Let all the streams that eastward go ,
Nor any one to give you free advice .
Only to purge all faults which thee defile
And pass their own inventions off instead .
What inward peace is born of strife
The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind :
These words of comfort to his heart down went ,
Let it divide us though our kingdom come ;
As leads the galaxy from pole to pole ,
That woman triumphs in their monarch spent .
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood ,
And you strike us with terror ,
Where grew the arts of war and peace ,
As day tells hours . by thy clear sun
This ghost will follow where i go .
And the maiden rose in beauty ,
That what is painful might be made their choice .
Another a wild night in wanton joy would spend .
And when the purpose of your march appears ,
Such virtue purchased as makes us to be
Dogged on the perilous heights
And pegu 's mighty empire southward bends :
The passer 's penny makes .
With blood in torrents spilt were darkly dashed .
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
So springs the towering palm too , and the fir
The moon sat waiting there to see ;
And new-blown flowers ' brightness meet .
His heart his wound received from my sight ;
She listen 'd with a flitting blush ,
I know not how the year may go ,
Amidst her maids , there held by utter shame .
" when the evening star brings darkness ,
And build up hopes that are shatter 'd quite ,
And bathed in ocean shoots a keener light ,
Be made to holy men , whose prayers might profit
His praise , who through that bloody field might pass
The season comes when first we met ,
The sea-winds housed within her hair :
One precious moment given to thee --
Of the woman outweighed superstitious alarm .
That often follows in the trail of wealth ,
And when the war had passed , and freedom raised
And wept till grief was stilled .
To erring zeal they gave new laws ,
All her tender limbs with terror shook .
Then the winds arose in fury ,
But no boy knows when he goes to sleep .
Truth fails not ; but her outward forms that bear
My comfort stood : and the bright sun was now
At the hour that i feel it ?
Wait not till honor lies wrapped in his pall !
Thy shells unbind ! night comes behind ;
Even the regret , the very pain they wake
Of this divine fruition fixed and planned ?
Though the skies wore a tinge of leaden grey ,
Horrors that make the heart stand still .
But now my flowers have found a fuller fragrance ,
_ god gave the rose its grace of glow ,
Which god has shown to thee . "
And draws it from its spotted shroud ,
My heart may not forgive . the tired years go
The kitchen , and made it look gay
Is lifted up in strife at all .
Your nerves should be suddenly thrown in a flutter
And crush the world till his wide corners meet .
For foreign lords shall sow your native land ,
And the souls crept out of their mouldy graves
So fresh that come in fasts divine !
The wind makes , in his many moods ,
Peace , like a white-winged dove descends
The pomp that brings and shuts the day ,
Of retribution fiercely works in me . ' "
It makes men rich in greatest poverty ;
Delicate mercies hide them there
Fresh groves grow up , and their green branches shoot
In this dark world can find a home .
Then in this common supplication join :
We bore it then when tyrants raved ,
He held his wrath with a curb of iron ,
You something of her tale may trace .
Which i roaring dashed to pieces ,
Oh , to feel the fresh breeze blowing
Draw us to hope now : let us be greater
I see that you wait for me here !
Thy foldless flock , or what rains beat ?
Objects that feel ; but much it matters here
The clock , upon her mantelpiece , strikes nine .
Lay on you the blame that bricks -- conceal ?
Or ran the chromatic scale up :
And love and wedlock showed divinely fair .
Sprung forth and seized the fatal sign .
But now i come to something more concrete :
Ere the tenacious cords of life give way .
The commons such affronts would never bear .
By contraries throughout the tale explain :
And angered at the indication shown ,
Today we bring you of our brightest rhyme .
There moved a presence always by his side ,
And add to these retired leisure
And in my eyes and on my face is drawn
As where smooth zephyrus plays on the fleet
They then turn witnesses against themselves ;
The juggler , willing , laid a wager ,
Voices , whose music on the spirit fell ,
Of footstep , coming soft and light !
Where secret tears have left their trace .
How the old steeples hand the scarlet ,
Not distant , on the happy coast she stood .
From isle to isle the wonder flew , it came
Farewell , farewell the heart that lives alone ,
The bent of nature ; which he thus expressed .
With its sharp edges turned toward mortal eyes ,
With pale lips parted , and sighs that shiver ,
With prow set to the orient of oblivion ,
It is a wilding child which comes
Where the sky stands on its head ?
Happy places have grown holy :
From out another worldflower lately flown .
Shining and constant as ever remain . "
And the new slave made a clearing .
Softly shone the sun upon it ,
That sweetness turns to loathsomeness .
Since sorrow never comes too late ,
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain . "
( our faith could boast no better men ) ,
My face made faint the face of man ,
Of art is lost -- it needs must shine
For that terrestrial name is carried ;
The vile informer 's gain to make . '
Whose blood upon thy threshold lies ?
They ring where the indian ganges rolls
Pope is commonly considered to have laid down the general
The loving father rose , and tears he shed
For your wild tears make darkness all too bright ,
Where grass and bending flowers
Worthy the lips that it must touch ,
" fate has offered me a prize ,
Whence could be swept a wide horizon round
Nor sound nor motion made :
The calm of use was coming o'er
To human hearts this vital splendour gives ;
It captive , and set kisses on its mouth ?
What vanity has brought thee here ?
Slander may wound thee , tyranny enslave ,
Some heavy hours went by before he rose .
At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise .
The thing i am , goes journeying onward through
A cure for sorrow from sighs i 'd borrow ,
Such as the slightest breath of air might scatter ;
He spake ; and moved by fury laid
Thus all their plan adjusted , diff'rent ways
And a good south wind sprung up behind ;
And efficacious doth she make lament ;
It came up redolent of god ,
Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal ,
Were her faint tones that thrilled upon my ear .
Hacks us thus cruelly , slivering again
Though death be seated nigh ,
That churlish season never frown 'd
The silent lyre that hangs upon me yet ?
And draw the inevitable fate that waits
To catch strong joy of solitude
Before the stars have left the skies ,
Thee i beheld , upon that highway drawn ,
His flaring beams , me , goddess , bring
The noble stuff of which his soul was made .
With thee to share disaster . of thy name
Of glimmering woods that glanced the hills between ,
And moved by love began anew :
Then the moon came quiet and flooded full
And he spoke the words which follow :
Summer set lip to earth 's bosom bare .
And if fortune go cross to my plan ,
As exhalations when they burst
And long experience hath made wise and sly ,
And in did come the strangest figure !
The passing farther onward took from it ;
For sicily , shall bear you to the straits
Which she discarded in the months gone by .
And now and then a mournful smile would raise
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
From out their putrid flesh exhale the worms ,
A hollow sigh , heaved from a depth profound .
O , feel the woe-waves break !
Spake the wizard , words as follow :
Out of their very beauty driven to dare
To meet our kiss that seems to burn , --
The beetle comes to wanton on the wing
No solemn host goes trailing by
As when , in summer , welcome winds arise ,
His silver beard , that swept his aged breast ,
To meet the fingers that form the lace .
Its own sweet light the moon shall leave
Behold the life at ease ; it drifts .
And as the shell the wild waves onward carry ,
Perhaps even i , reserved by angry fate ,
From the rocks where fierce gales blew it ,
And darkness creeps to hide the hateful crime .
As incense rises from the homes of prayer ,
Streaming with blood .
Thoughts of fair souls attain ,
And counting each trial for truth as their gain !
At christmas next , if they keep their word ,
Church bells have catched my ear .
Even sunday shines no sabbath day to me ;
A lonely road to follow ;
That melt into pale undulations and muffled echoes
O love divine , that stooped to share
Seasons will pass till autumn fades the rose ;
Pale , weak , and worn with ceaseless care .
And the blue sky shines so clear !
She crown 'd with olive green , came softly sliding
May fill out the life that to you remains .
Than such as doth to lovers ' words belong ,
Can bear more curse .
The wasted ecstasy just spilt
_ trow _ , to make believe .
A piece of it past bearing bright .
Hence , captains , to your stations fly .
And warming in our own ,
And the shadows pressed till my heart was sore .
For the grief which her spirit allows .
That keeps me sad and celibate .
Or melt the glittering spires in air ?
And oft will flow amid their happiest hours ;
Later still comes the time when the selectors became
A heart that can not wander .
Where the ink that once so sluggishly was crawling
A feast was held that selfsame night
By birth , -- who boasts a genealogy
Will give you full relief ;
Few green and golden leaves withheld from the storm ,
Again the web she tried to trace ,
The lark 's shrill song doth wake the dawn :
But in abhorrence backward drew ;
There came into many a burgher 's pate
I seek the visions i have long since lost .
And tears shall fall for aye .
In other wise this bold assault is made ;
Its massy waters meet and flow ;
Darkness and solitude shine , for me .
Their souls ascend to heaven .
Cold while he kindled others ' love :
With spirit and put cowardice to flight ;
And make her mourn with my mourning .
As though it feared to be too soon forgot
Where the spine joins it . not more furiously
The sap of pulsing life would upward flow ,
This prison so entrapped that valiant knight ;
The music speaks them handy ,
The name should keep or hide from view .
Where he sat as a criminal , ready to meet
Take leave of empty laughter , emptier tears ,
That his counsel should pass his lordes wit .
In a listening heart it nestled ,
And in the night , gave each another tongue ,
For bragging time was over and fighting time was come
The nations bless me as they reap . "
And wings the soul with boundless flight to soar ,
Take care the village to alarm ;
No point of courtesy was lost :
An eye of tearful sorrow threw }
His startled ears the increasing cries attend ;
The chapters holding peaks to scale ,
And the wretched council 's bosoms beat ,
Nor turn them up to pray .
The graceful lines of art may trace ,
In your voice as it said good-bye
And they keep moving onward year by year ,
Transformed the scene to multitudinous troops
So that my sight went little in advance ;
Transgression has not come to us .
Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow ;
That the heart can hardly frame ,
The waters that like diamonds shone
Thy grace can send its breathings o'er
And which in all griefs doth relieve !
Its lessons alone are the things you should keep .
Assumes th ' organic powers its seed convey 'd .
Thereby full many a hero thereafter lost his life .
Where maids have spent their hours .
Sad , robbed of merits , drug the cup
The rivers sing of peace .
Was never mine . we hold a banquet here .
What need had we to reckon o'er
Till lovers go blind and sway with me ? --
Spread a dusk carpet for the sun to cast
The watch cried out he saw phoenician land ;
There kept their watch the legions , while the grand
Of long-deferred defeat , which waits and takes
Where once the canteen flourished ' neath our flag ,
Pray , moses , give calhoun the wink ,
The old world 's evil outcasts came .
Thy days of freedom lost , and led away
That home we loved in days gone by ?
And even this creature ! " which words saying ,
Crushed in the fall of what he cast away .
Lakshmaṇ his answer thus returned ,
Of the refreshment thither brought with care .
Give god 's idea sway ,
Her finger , annie fought against his will :
Death in his palace holds his court ,
That stretches upward toward the great divide .
And my strained eyesight lost its power ,
Or there will come a fearful crash
Which passes one off as learned and clever ,
The gentle rays shine o'er ,
Whence fall the roofs a ragged plain
And now had greece eternal fame acquired ,
I find the grey sea 's notes of green ,
She hears the heavenly music borne .
But each was fearful lest his dream came true .
And found some comfort in his misery .
And follow death ere i have reached my prime ,
Till the waves washed through the rib-bones ,
The stars shine out ; the forest bends ;
Wild coyotes broke the silence
With brightening smiles the vision hung
Against the danger desperately hurled ,
To get where life begins , and still we groan
Rustling among his snow-drifts , and resigns
't was pity nature brought ye forth ,
That is told by golden hours .
This done , collection for the saints is made ,
And lifting it , these words the monarch said :
We felt , with cloudings of despair ,
And the young child gave this answer :
To bring us back assurance in that faith ,
Far from it 's zenith yet low lagging clouds
Was poisonous anger fired ;
But this love comes no more again .
To roses bowering a nest ,
How i was duped and led astray
The sunshine of god can not fall there ,
Above the altar held the morning sun :
Why should it only say the long night through ,
But yet it got abroad . he would unfold ,
From the boat made ready answer :
Warriors with weapons . the world seethed with slaughter .
Unmooned , of nights that creep
A day that shall live in story ;
Gilding the foliage , glorying the flowers ,
And in the dead land where ye ghosts draw breath
Sate the king when healths went round .
That from his lips the words had passed ,
The dear saints feel an answering thrill .
And hence thy surname grew . i follow 'd then
Virtue alone can make a happy life .
Wherof thei made hire soverain .
What lacks my heart , that makes it
Wave follows wave , the letter 'd lines decay ,
Into his father 's place and honor stepped :
Nor strove that passion to allay ,
The northern foes have trod us down ,
Their hearts and ears did greet ,
Where now he takes his rest !
" a stream runs from my wounded i ,
Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main ;
And youth hides yet amid this hair of mine ,
Again we 'll shine triumphant out !
For gloomy clouds then broke and fled away .
Shall furnish at the annual feast
And when the summer comes again
Than she had reached in most of christendom .
Now he sinks , his features leaden
And the cry of the herons winging their way
Of love makes dark things wait upon the bright ,
Are rare . with this distinction take my words ;
Then the bird of air struck fire ,
And the fierce commons echo back the sound .
Admitting motion in the heavens , to show
How rapidly my girl was sinking .
Him in this pressing peril to advise ,
Think that a hundred years have now passed by ,
Nor thy tears wedge thy soldered lids apart ,
Her garments float and gather
Assoiled , and from their sins set free ;
In her sad eyes that seemed to lean
The winged pinnace shot along the sea .
Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
That fills the heart to overflow -- there is
Before the love-sick roman spread the boast
The saddest tears must fall ;
Thus time 's deluding seasons pass ,
And shook as it rush 'd by her .
The people 's favour held , yet faith with fear
A thistle-down , before the breezes blown ,
And only their dim holiness remains .
They might escape the lash of punishment .
Trembling around grave manhood 's stem might cling ,
How all his malice served but to bring forth
And the sun went down in a crimson ball ,
Like indra ’s staff when storms have blown .
Though many maids would stretch their arms to thee ,
Cowering beneath dark wings that love must chase , --
Of homely toil , may serve to show
So i must fly -- my fate is sealed ,
The grey clouds hide the sun now
I sometimes feel the thread of life is slender ;
Search where the desert regions lie .
And mend the blunders pride or folly makes ?
Graced the scant blossoms of the tree ,
That not alone they shall not feel fatigue ,
On his way went swiftly forward ,
And from his eyes red lightning flashed .
By memories wrapt that whispered to me low ,
Of beauty round them shone !
Then your kiss will hold me fast --
And graver cares to carduel now recall :
Thy covenant fulfill ;
Of my bleak desolation . the wave broke
" and set your prow south-western ways
But thus their love is shown ;
Hover , and catch the shooting stars by night .
In faith shall rest .
A blow for justice ? sure your pulses stirred ,
Thy wilderness now weds , thy desert blooms .
Like snowy clouds the young sheep lay ,
And ask forgiveness for the pious zeal
For god has made this world of ours
Darkness came over the noon ... and i died !
The dark spruce forests made them strong ,
To bring rome in unto the way of life ,
Of the kindly shade which the maples made
By turning to a lover ? "
The tie that binds her to my heart .
Yea , his deserter ; and came to wonder
The human soul that through me ran ;
Quick , painter , quick , the moment seize ,
I take the train for the suburbs
As when the bridegroom leads the bride ,
The lords of chios into exile went .
Till on the level height their steps found ease :
Or anywise connected with said death .
And as in some gay garden stretched upon
The sun , which on the righteous hebrew beamed ,
On the mat her hands lay idle ,
No less renowned than war : new foes arise ,
Son of the sword that first made kings divine ,
Whose features bore the marks of truth ;
For a phantom world he sounded and found wanting
The unhappy knight perceived the hope was o'er ,
Where persian mountains greet the rising sun
The hours slid fast , as hours will ,
Much hath he sought to find salvation 's way ;
Following an ideal !
Which tried at an exultant prophecy
Nor would i break for your sweet sake
Deceived ben with wordes softe
My soul can reach , when feeling out of sight
All felt the worship , all confessed the god ,
And heavenly smiles descended on that happy pair .
Wisdom he makes to form the fruit
Ah , for that gift all thanks are given !
The artist wrought this loved guitar ;
Song . the sentiments borrowed from shakespeare
... now there came both mist and snow ,
Can urge through heaven and hell their way .
The willows shivered , wanly lay the snow ;
Though we have lost the giant mould .
I give thee , bird , advice ;
No strife and care would reach me there .
Greater and nobler done , and to lay down
Death quench or evil stir ,
Passed by , and dropped their tears upon the tomb
Yet on the sadness thought sublimely broke :
In equal share for that sin wrought by eve ,
Their love made life one melody , like birds ,
Or read that precious book which does unfold salvation .
Drink of these waters as they run
To read high hope out of dark oracles ,
That angel-sadness ye would fitly take .
How jubilant it was to give me pleasure .
It has thrilled with love 's red wine ;
The shears , plunged the shears through .
The leaves drop from our rose of dawn ,
And never put foot in old england again . ”
The weak winds lifting gently its light hair ;
With thirstie eare thee compassing about ,
Defended thus their speedy course they take ,
This poor song that sings of thee ,
With female monsters evil miened
Who turn the good to evil ,
The lean shoal told to me .
Have cast their lives away ? go quickly thou
My cheek , where the blushes came and went ;
Let not the sun go down upon your wrath .
Scenting , blow the triple team ;
That violent things more quickly find a term
Nor without the helm to guide them . "
While on the soft west wind come odors
Is fixed all on that which now they see ;
We wonder what its course may yield ,
The road and fill their shuttles while they weave ,
Come , cross the flood that seeks the sea ,
Believe , and show the reason of a man ;
Wha should swing in a rape for an hour ,
The airy streamers form the downward line ;
Had shut within him the rare seed
Glory of youth glowed in his soul :
The din that yet more fearful grows
That knows no sin or wrong ;
Denying naught , he sulked and held his peace ;
Learn what a skirmish tells ,
This the divine cecilia found ,
His suit , weighing out with nonchalance
Some fled ; and some their fears detained :
The god a regal emerald throne upheld ;
The tenth day passed : the prince again
Now , though your love seek mine for mate .
When spring comes in again .
Where lost in vague , historic haze ,
Of things eternal , mounting to divine ,
There comes a " hush ! "
March , with his usual terrors armed ,
Than guilt and shame have made thee .
If other eyes but wintry looks should give ;
And fawning round his feet confess their joy .
His thoughts to king sugríva flew :
Cold waxed his heart , and weary and distraught ,
I feel the dusky softness whirr
From candles lighting death ! all eyes , still fixed
What form my dreaming was about to take .
Sharper than sharpest sword , it fell on him
As ' the wild man went his weary way
That they might tell me all they felt .
For the autumn must come with its mournful story ,
Doth feel for thine ! "
Comes that fond soul this blessed even
Thou hast not followed that immortal star
I will not bear false witness against any ,
And all those airy silks to flow ,
But see their danger , they would cry ,
Put forth thy strength , o lord .
Cold as a dagger-point pricking the skin
A new dispute there lately rose
Death comes to set thee free ;
Where upward sent in stormy shower ,
There in a ship they bore those lovers cold .
The cannons poured forth fire and thunder ,
Leave battles to the turkish hordes ,
Affection bends the judgment to her ply .
And this thought made their souls more reconciled ,
His blood-gained liberty is lost !
I made a wish that i might feel his kiss
There to find the words i needed ,
With its dark buds and leaves wandering astray ;
Of danger in the roaring sea ,
To lead stark life where mailed death is king ;
To shake the iron hand of fate
Leading the westward way .
And , strengthened by the wondrous gift of love ,
The loving heart that gave ;
It is i that have grown old .
But i would go through all again with joy ,
And my spirits gushed and bubbled like a fountain
In heaven alone the promised blessing lies ,
With ceaseless bloom , thy steps will stay . ”
Prometheus up and wrenched the fire from zeus .
And souls of sinners find it barred ,
And austria bent , and prussia broke ,
The hardy roots locked in their silent tomb .
My old remembrances went from me wholly ,
Our tears are shed , our sighs are given ;
Bearing in his arms the winnings ,
The sun no more its beams shall give
To make the festive brilliance shine .
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee ,
By sight of these amid her glory stayed .
And sees the watery mountains break below .
Where imperishable shields and swords were beaten out
And then , continuing , it said : " therein
Whose shoes made a horrible creaking ;
And in this subtler measure hid his woe .
To force of cheer a greater show ,
A wicked whisper came , and made
The worthless words are set in gold .
At last they gave her pitying peace ,
Silence self-spelled , and there arose ,
But it tells of tears and blood ;
Bending as he swept the chords
He knew to read ; his medicine could find
Dark hollows seem to glide along and chase
Where boiled the tumult of love 's surging sea ,
That too much adamantine makes the mind ;
In which dark corner now it lay , --
Her blush of hope she strove to hide ;
And at every drifting cloud that went
No memories revived of war and strife ,
Mind can not follow it , nor words express
Of fear , sprung from a wench 's bench ,
When safety lay in leading through ,
We gave them battle . when the pylian host
The prudent fisher upward goes ;
Hushed trees , still vale dissolving in the dew ,
But lashed the city , and dissected crimes .
And merged her rose-red beauty in july ,
Loud rang the emptied beakers as he mused ,
The truth from thee i can not keep . ”
Would cast a shade so drearily .
A long and weary time had passed ,
With engines of their craft to read the thing ;
Nor guile was in it found .
He made the soul from possible intellect ,
The stripes ran up and down .
My life to scape from him , reflection made ,
That all feet pass and praise .
Boldly they stood as champions for the right ,
Before the goddess , foes and flames retire .
In thought that battle . but there came the noise
And rain swept as birds flocking sweep .
What if your toys had been tainted with crime ?
And join with thee calm peace and quiet ,
Sudden it came and soon its work was done ,
Take thou example by julius cesar
The minster-clock has just struck two ,
Round his nose the polar wind blew ;
How could the hand that gave such charms ,
His godlike fury startled from amaze .
The world fell so that ilke tide ,
Through home-bred traitors fed within its walls .
He found what oft the generous bosom seeks ,
Romance brought up the nine-fifteen . "
The wide-extended continents obey :
The lion having reached his head ,
The cold that cramped and froze ;
A hungry panther seeking for his meat ,
Whom death once grasped but soon restored .
My fate she follow 'd . ignorant of this
But men of worship set in authoritie
Let me lie here and rest my aching side .
The nerves of boyhood strung !
To marygolds the hyacinth applies ,
The mule can scarcely find the misty ridge ;
That follow 'd the mystical moon through the night .
That filled thy soul with joyous dread ,
As the wind bore him , floated far away .
No disenchantment follows here ,
To find her death in loneliness
The ransomed soul is gently led
There very weeping suffers not to weep ;
The winds repeat the solemn strain ,
His spirit , with its wisdom , lingered long .
Beowulf lov 'd , these battle-weeds wear ,
But sadder still to mark the while ,
Unseen of any , always went his way .
Heroes no more at death 's approach shall groan :
Whose quenchless flames the world consume .
Here spread the fields that heaped their ripened store
Summer hath come , led on by sunny may
Roses , wreaths and banners float
For keeping honest counsels none will pay .
And day and night yield one delight once more ?
A storm assailed us , of such cruelty ,
A new-fledged eaglet spread his wings
And something human bounds and forms the god ;
That they might burst the bonds of lust
And yet he lives and keeps a hope .
And timely guile unguarded finds them lie .
New light and strength they give !
Summer is gone and the days grow cold . "
The noisy swallows wheeled above their nests ,
With faith of all earth 's hope renew 'd
And shrink not from the tyranny to come ?
Sumantra passed in silence by ,
The powers of nature in me , lest they run
Man honours where the grave remembers not .
And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true .
This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage ,
Nameless itself , to ocean gives its waves
Benign , and of our merit take no count .
-- when next the bat of evening flew ,
A true thing tell :
Its little ray of gladness throw .
By dark clouds wandering round the mountain 's zone ,
The spirits foul to hell the angels drove ;
The prince whose arm bright glory gained ,
There menelaus held his cautious course .
Wherefrom the breeze took life and sang .
The races rise ; the races pass ;
Within his spiry folds drew , and devoured .
And the surges sing his winnings ,
On the bridge one leap he makes ;
The noble burden of his corpse to carry :
Her charms , perceived to prosper first
Slumber well where the shell screamed and fell .
All night the red flame stabbed the sky
As my lost boyhood is to me ?
And his heart stirred within him . now the queen
There came to the making of man
To draw the arrow from his cincture forth .
Each warrior feels his creeping blood to freeze ,
And a ' ter twelve o'clock had come
Frosty wind made moan ,
Who wail or hail the death of god
And draws the horizons unto him .
Lured by the vision and fashioned to fail ,
There , age sits down beneath the shade ,
The wanton snow flew on her breast
A cradled infant gave the wondrous sign .
Not present , brought no terror to thy soul :
Love will come to-morrow , and sadness ,
Taking to her woman heart all forlorn endeavour ;
A while distinct through many channels run ,
Such the mighty shout that fills
How she listened to hear it repeated ! it came
Your freedom 's angel calls ,
To make you the soundest of sound politicians .
Our company blithe echoes make ;
Just as the sun shed its last ray ,
This glory jesus ' word reveals ;
Only to save me from such memories
Here make i proclamation of my faith ,
My chance of all promotion 's gone ,
The rustling leaves are dancing
Pass with dim smiles and make our hearts sublime !
Or reckon every head marphisa left
The picture as it came .
The fields swell upward to the hills ; beyond ,
The dogmas of religion admit only that which places
White of heat , the circlet wore .
And when the circling stirrup-cup went round ,
Seen many autumns shed their yellow leaves
Before the stars have left the skies ,
Left little record of his name ,
And anger reigned unbridled by the law .
No mortal heart can show ;
So friendship 's fervours sink to rest ,
I have always found eating a wondrous relief ;
They had not lost their ancient faith in him ,
Tables of the law was made ;
Filled fu ' wi ' clavers about sin
Of song that up from dreamland come .
To where the rivulets of sweet water ran ;
Thence shed again in blessing on their souls ,
The joys of life thus from her flung --
Divine despair , rolled upward on the wings
My heart was filled with marvel and dream ,
Whose whispered wisdom follows where i fare ,
Followed by silence dead and dull ,
Watched at the mouth , a year went by .
Depart not we , till first thy choice be made
The golden-rod still rears its yellow crest .
But thy cold bosom stirred not ;
His voice was swallowed in the shout that rose ,
Idaeus took his way : in council there
And she rose and ministered in her household ;
Her feet disperse the powdery snow ,
And a field he spread with reindeer ,
Make england stand supreme for aye ,
Who felt the furnace too :
For thus the poet at the last shall reach
At midnight , taking breath an hour before , --
At this , a flood of tears lavinia shed ;
And made resolve to speed his wooing on
The two exceptions must have suffered from sunstroke .
Or depths to fathom , made our glee ;
To stem the torrent of a woman 's will :
Into the melting fat the fire catches ,
Gangá whose waters cleanse and save ,
And our wild bees lend their rainbow wings
Courage , if sorrow come , to bear it ,
There came a child before theophilus
To the earl then went an armed warrior ;
It makes the noble mind more noble still :
She took the tried clay of the common road --
Sighing winds through fir-trees swept ,
And tears forever flowing ,
And take a trip on credit valley ,
In that abyss of horror , whence they sprung ;
Meanwhile the southwind rose , & with black wings
In dreadful silence , and the low groan came ,
Whose valor will not bear them !
And , proud as lady gnome to shine ,
All wonderful , filled full of pains to come
Who for his sake has lost heaven 's grace
The answer given thou canst unfold aright ,
Like the hell-dragon , thus he kept
To spend our honeymoon !
It is gone to-day
And from her beauty took the brightest gem ,
They say he sees as an instant thing
Remotely , plays on the misdeeming sense ,
To bring us back assurance in that faith ,
Now , i put it to you , sir ,
Against the gathered darkness of the past .
The sunlight slants across her hair ;
But now the winds sing through and shake
He stood , and filled with silent awe ,
His dreaded glories shining forth ;
Rang forth that lay so sweet to hear ,
And calms their fury with his look and word .
With the triumph coming on !
With bowed brow and accents broken ,
The chimneys , over them see depths of blue .
Associated with my humble birth .
Old memories swam up dear , old joys forgot ,
Yet through measured grave accord ,
That still diffuse their sweetness through the air ,
Within an inner room his couch they spread ,
And set them in the firmament of heaven
Ungentle moods express ,
The biting axe of florence . farther on ,
And , strange enough , this eve a letter came
Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies :
I saw her growing angry . then i added :
The critic 's lot is passing hard --
In woe that wrestled with belief ,
They look 'd like persons being led to sentence ,
A little cloud would move across the blue .
The well-earned crown for roman life preserved ,
Give half his years if he but could
But when they went to combat hand for hand ,
And cold old age came creeping on ?
Where boats can find a way ,
' twill charm your poet 's eyes to find
Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize ,
And the vapors that arise
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead ,
It well had paid a week of toil ;
And the sudden truth arise ,
He squared us to the charging hordes .
His soul proud science never taught to stray
Your name called by an echo in a dream ;
To pacify the world when it should see .
He rushes on my mortal guess
Seldom brings order , but confusion .
Too long the south has wept , bewailing
There is no evil that can find you here .
Upon those youths next sprang the furious knight .
If this were human breath i drew .
And lamia 's voice still warbled there !
The treaties made ; himself and all his camp
Her proud lips trembling piteously :
That govern as by time or chance ,
And push the work from early morn till night .
And with what fogs my brain has fought ,
Low hung the clouds , distended with the gale
And give it a permanent place in the heart .
To burst into heartbroken tears undescried !
Which their temper does rather consume .
Type of the thoughts that lived within ,
To speak ; whereat their doubled ranks they bend
And the city was made a tomb ,
That to the winds give voice --
As firmly as more favored nations hold ;
Though filled with rapture and delight ,
The pansies nodded their purple heads ;
The midnight owl hath made her secret nest .
Till bullets clipt an angle ,
So souls grow tranquil as their thoughts expand .
Her thundered words , and cried in sharp despair ,
For heathen heart that puts her trust
And menace death : those menaces shall move
There came a hunger in the gloating eyes ,
A river runs which much gold yields ;
The brownies ' round a comrade drew ,
And her breath the south wind , which discloses
All hell echo round with their din .
O gentle laughters ! rising from the crystal spring
And hate of it lays you in it .
The blossomed boughs , and passed on steadily ,
Into new loves the eternal love unfolded .
The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of ,
Which stands upon the shores of mystery
No air can thee retain :
A king might wish to hold in fee .
_ give its grace to thee . _
Sends daily word , of import calm yet keen ,
So leeches stick , nor quit the bleeding wound ,
This banner ( for such vow i made )
Though miles on miles of space between them lie ,
Night made the moment full of mysteries .
On what that hope is grounded ; --
Blue depths where once deucalion found release .
To look upon the coming year .
Or swell to wonted heights of fair renown
Such charms thy beauty wears , as might
Are now with groves and pastures spread .
The green shoots of his vine which last year bore
But with our mute regrets there mingle
You wives and maids give ear-o !
My lonely house will thrill some day
To mar its trust or stir its depths serene .
Awhile , her drawn and troubled face to hide ,
And clouds that hovered all day by ,
But the old wife made him answer ,
A pulse stirred in the plastic slime
To ope the ancient text an impulse strong
But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles .
With light that heavenly knowledge lent ,
And give them battle ! how my heart leaps up
And the great winds bring healing in their sound .
High to th ' ethereal regions mounted . part ,
Edinburgh periodical , conducted by dr james anderson .
Whose slightest action or inaction serve .
Through italy , and fills the neighbouring towns .
His empire , and in glory reigned
Where the etrurian athens claims and keeps
And warming in our own ,
Where he had spread his treasures were become one tongue
Nothing hangs tedious , nothing old revolves
And hector ’s blood shall smoke upon thy lance .
Of odour tracks the bodies of the slain .
In love that finds no answering word or smile ?
Which makes thee wonder ; and so purge the cloud
The lowliest duties on herself did lay .
Into whose keeping christ did give the keys
Where the crystal-clear ocean a melody sang
From this his substance , that his honour take .
So shall the northern pioneer go joyful on his
Of every beauty grow in power ascending ,
The powers above would note the quoted text ,
Which raise up enmity and strife ,
And power has never come to draw the sting
Set their brief love on men .
The sun hath awoke ; and in garments of gold
A whining thing will pluck your heel ,
Green fiddleheads uncurled
Holding the calm watch of eternity .
To dull and bring forgetfulness of pain .
Give me a maiden beauty 's blood ,
Old age should not make him tremble .
And summoned back to life again
As the sun comes over the hampshire hills .
Though festive roses o'er the gifts were spread .
' gainst latin enemies these arms we bear .
While the eternal ages watch and wait .
And note her tearful eyes ;
Is distant , but whose fame shall never die .
Answered in the words which follow :
Of our array that turned the day to night ;
Comes bitter fruit of sin and crime ,
Thus having said , he spurs amid the foes ,
While hotly round them shines the tropic wave ,
He held him outclassed and outpaced .
Upon my brow i feel the furrow 's course ,
Had made a pretext of a hindering wound ,
Of stringent government ; a few to lead
To fix each calendar , with human date .
As warmer life in every limb had crowned you ;
The shrill cry pierced through ráma ’s ears
Nor thy wisdom lost in ether . "
That lay in the house that jack built .
But taken from me was this drowsiness
Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows ;
Shall make men glad with unexpected fruits .
Like the soap bubble , puffed and burst , --
Too great to bear his misery grew ,
Doth from the vision , that reflects the scene .
Wherof , to take mi witnesse ,
The morn the shades of night dispelled .
The woods are wrapped in deeper brown ,
Low murmuring crowds around a temple stood :
When on you dawned the first equality ,
By rules or forms that many mad men give .
The branches yielding thousand buds .
Living again in beauty that knows no death .
Strove with wise charm their grief to ease
" and shall we bear and bend for ever ,
Are healed with the healing which night has shed .
His wiles will break and spend themselves in vain .
Who , giving breath to the sonorous reeds ,
Therefore i have to the uttermost exposed the bitterness
Never to feel the pain of growing old ,
And then the scarlet screams stood forth revealed .
The culinary task devolved on him .
The bent oars kept a steady song ,
Till the rosy morning led on the laughing day !
In safety lead them , where the other crag
Best lay the rhyme , best lead the dance ,
Out to the point where all and nothing meet .
Give to us thy friendly greetings ,
Has fallen voiceless in our glorious feast . "
The phantom armies marching go !
First came the primrose ,
For ever , and seal up his ravenous jaws .
Thirsting to pour forth blood for blood ,
Hunger and thirst to work our woe combine ,
And the night has come , and planets glinted ,
The victory lay with malbrook .
With joyful waters sped :
And all my doubts are dissolved .
The cruel fiends our bodies tear .
Not one , to soften censure 's hardy crime ;
For when the almighty word went forth
Where nations bound in ties of peace
Does the fish soar to find the ocean ,
Which anson [ a ] hardly could escape ,
The tattered leaves drive whirling past
I 've thrown away my only true bliss
Opened its heart with the magic of grief !
The winter passes and the days come in
And into their sport with them went he , --
This does not come with houses or with gold ,
And both the riddle and the answer find ,
Like the drifting snow she sweeps
Bringing the tears to my lashes ,
Once more thy sinai-thunders rolled .
Their love rose up and followed close behind .
Storms would bring us pain and trouble ,
The hapless heart that 's stung by thee ! "
Homeward , with anger and with fury stung ;
Clear water , that no clouding shadows reach :
Where is the play-boy can claim an equality
Ten thousand banners rise into the air ,
The massive joints , the sinews firmly strung ,
Mid flowering trees where creepers twined .
Tho ' all i honour and hold dear
Through the spheres strange concord sending .
Grew fain to find employment for my skill ;
His azure glowed as a cloud worn thin ,
The sweat ran down upon each sunburnt face ,
The roots no more their upper load sustain ;
When thy dear footsteps fled them . be content .
What words the parent 's joy can tell
And such joys as these she 'll bring .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Seething like waves that roll ,
And caught a happy memory .
Which brought me here with pamela
Fifteen years have gone round
Where the sound of saari opens ?
And darkness straightway stole across the deep ,
Best lay the rhyme , best lead the dance ,
The life that brings the brow of care .
And sorrow 's shafts must enter both our hearts ;
Or gave the earth its harmony ,
Should share each other 's nature knit in bliss .
Or match with destiny for beers .
To me with filial reverence they bring ,
Now nation looks to nation , that may live
" the dust of praise that is blown everywhere
Bringing its thousand joys thy heart to fill .
What bountiful blessings they bring !
Every season hath its pleasures ;
But deadliest poison in the taste is found --
The water dwells a multitude , whose sighs
Has come between them , they from rites of love
Had tasted jesus ' love , which selfishness controls ;
Where wild oswego spreads her swamps around ,
To bring no sounds that were not sweet ,
When mary stay 'd beneath . but not to deal
My thoughts hold mortal strife ;
Where the grim palace wears the prison 's frown ,
Music has opened her hands ,
And the glory of an age was passing by .
Disease consumed thy vitals ; war upheaved
By love doth love grow mighty in its love :
From whom the answer came unto these words ,
Your loathing of it , if you feel that way
The even scales of justice to o'erweigh .
With stifling heat , heaving it up in sleep ,
There let it lie , a thing of naught .
Against a foe less foul than this made head ,
Yet for a little they stand ,
Britannia holds the empire of the waves ,
Far as euboea though thy country lay ,
Misfortunes serve to make us wise :
While , flitting gay , the swallows play
Given him oft in battles gone ,
The dusk of death , warm hands , stretched out
Casts forth his bait to snare the smaller fry ,
To match the princely chase afford ? '
I shall drive thee to the summer ,
Charlotta held her breath for very fear ,
Of any princely house has passed ,
You know so ill to deal with time ,
And let it go on without us .
And with sweet breath perfumes the rising steam .
One nail drives out another from its place .
Love looks on you and trembles into sound ;
And the pale glory strengthened round it dead ;
Slept the dim light of days gone by ;
Mark how the annals of the ages teem
Were left for its fruition ; light of heart ,
That seemed to speak of pity , and he said
Or the butterfly sunset claps its wings
All , which makes death a hideous show !
And with all their strength they stripped it .
Of his pure eye to light her dreams ,
The church its cherished union found ,
The social cup we did our best to press ,
Pleased on the boiling wave old æson swims ,
Spring comes and goes and comes again
When lay of hopeless love , or glory won ,
From the comforts of home drove me famished away ;
Above the storm our prayers we lift :
And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls :
No flash of lightning lit the sky ,
The quiet day to round the hours for bed ;
Its winter , which endureth still --
There flashed a sudden and vague unrest ,
And bended dolphins play : part huge of bulk
The vast gray church that seems to breathe
Speak , my brother , thy counsel lend , --
Yet warmth of afterglow bathes all .
Swelling the song that my paddle sings .
Meanwhile came many thoughts : on me
Slow sinking through the tearful mist --
This is the one whose bat-soul comes
Where shall the weary soldier find his rest ?
That happier breath had moved , her husband turned
Nor thou the nearer to my promise brought .
Some people will shew symptoms of repentance
-- the polish 'd walls reflect her rosy smiles ,
Although with him they acted as he willed ,
The sea has worn her ships like precious stones ,
To follow through the night the moving moon ,
The drops ran down as slow as fate --
Upon your faint sweet breath is borne a sigh ,
The whispering waves of darkness curled .
Have took thy folded songs on trust ,
One boat shall bear us twain .
Where the gifts hang on the tree ,
To breathe new mystery , breathed by you .
The banquet found eternally the same ! )
And we were left to feel the bitter blast .
And let me catch the soul
They turn to sweetness , and drop holy balm ,
Since michael and his powers went forth to tame
In empty air their sportive javelins throw ,
The life which passes mourns its wasted hour .
Virtue shall teach the soul its way to heaven .
My heart turns crying from the rose and book ,
Hymns of joy were heard to swell .
‘ judge if it stands not hard with me ;
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
Colours go and colours come .
More slow it rolls ; its furious race
Writhed not at passed joy ?
And she , close clinging in her last despair ,
Flowing from sources hid far , far beyond ,
I call for vengeance to the angered sky .
And atheist brood on earth may rise .
And every flower that sad embroidery wears ;
It forms a curious chapter , i admit .
And dash your venom in your face
Then my swelled head shall strike the stars .
Have made the ancient cities rot and die .
Fine as the hair which sways beneath a soul
So much as touched the immobile mystery .
Right joyous smiling took the lead .
With ugly painfulness forsook her hold ,
So that they set the point upon the heel .
My soul is singing with the happy birds ,
That tells the story of a man who , praying
I have for certain put into thy mind
Their feet the river swirled and chucked . they sat
And forth they flow and pile destruction round ,
As a friend from friends his final withdrawal prolonging ,
A splendid image built of man has flown ;
And the changes that are sure to come
And leave no traces where it stood ;
And misty grew her eyes , and slowly filled .
Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue ,
That came forth singing ever in man 's ears
I feel my childhood 's joys once more ,
Seemed trembling with delight to bear ;
Her face leaned out and took the sacred glow
A slight repast makes people love much more ,
Calling on the gods for succor ,
Which he felt to be pulsing with ecstasy ,
Which made the men with strongest anger rave .
There may be fairer gardens light the plain ;
By arrogance and folly led ;
He gave freedom 's bold processes :
That held a dummy coffin . stranger still
What it could mean , this soar from sorrow ;
A dozen rafts the circle make ,
And give to rapture all thy trembling strings .
By sire and grandsire held in high esteem .
The slanting sunbeams fell upon his face ,
But right or left as strikes the player goes ;
Though bows lie broken on the strings ,
And on her shadow rides in floating gold . "
Or other noise made by the princes shut
If the beggar can give me work .
But mighty harvests crown the loaded fields ,
Comes the loud crash of thunder , and between
One headed by benaiah brown ,
There stands his learned dictum
Take you the charge that he before us come
Your peace you put into your lovers power :
Which lucifer in rage from god cast down .
To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear ,
Death has cast o'er her his spell .
My soul would one day go and seek
The army but reflects their love of right .
You make men desperate if they once are bad :
To make payment , while i call :
And laughing streamlets chase the flying hours .
God makes as if he least knew how to guard
Race after race their honors yield ,
And night is coming down !
My wonder grows , since knowledge came
On the cold earth were by thy courage laid ?
Though each false idol fell to dust ,
The tree-tops sound and vanes go round
Where pleasure lies , carelessly smiling at fame ;
And thronging serfs their lord pursue .
To show that one heart was loyal yet .
Because your highest words fall short ?
While the dreadful carcasses lay overwhelmed beneath their own
Could creep o'er his cell of bone .
The pulses flying through my frame , died out .
Alone her task was wrought ,
When thy wife shall feel unhappy ,
That seals my lonely lot :
The pity of the snow that hides all scars ;
Their words preach virtue , and her charms display ,
With my young heart filled with terror ;
No true repose hast found ,
That through each room a golden pipe may run
But never a feathery leaf is lost ;
Of other worlds there came a light
Was by a vile seducer led astray
Thy soul in calm content shall fall asleep ,
The secret love that all my being stirred ?
Be health around it ever spread ,
That made them stretch and yawn ,
Signs of her wanderings are shown ,
None the slightest blemish in either form could spy .
Of every malice that wins hate in heaven ,
Had sought the forest for a life of prayer .
That carried him in triumph to the hill ;
The scriptures teach that pastors should take heed
Thus to grieve and flutter here ,
The book of life , which i have traced ,
Rich blessings come to those who thee maintain .
The flower that gives me nourishing ;
Answer in the words which follow :
Still autumn was it , & the meadows slept ,
Taking what may befall , by grief unmoved ,
Can we observe what 's lost at any time ,
Where spring , that goes not out to sea ,
And makes a covenant never to destroy
As when the vision rose on virgin dreams .
It found its music in my lady 's voice .
Where the sweet sunshine lay dead ;
And add unto their burning by their shame .
Yet will true taste , that ranges unconfined ,
Of honours that the stately school had known .
One object and one form , and builds thereby
The restless brook did check its rapid course ;
The flowers give their fragrance joyously
As it through the clouds dropped downward ,
Our brave armada held her vent ' rous way ,
There 's nobody making a noise to-day ,
The pale which held that lovely deer :
The faith and moral nature gave before ;
His thought must follow where they pass ;
Shall pass o'er the magic circle ;
My first is followed by a bird :
Some by old words to fame have made pretence ,
And bathing , as she went her naked feet .
Thy spell controls e ' en life and death ,
The heralds gave to every grecian chief
Fairy barks that have drifted to land .
Doth beare the influence of my destiny .
That hung around the wretches as they writhed ,
The holy oil that feeds the flame .
Folded through winter , spring spreads down again ;
Just draw the blind , and closely scan
But every mountain now hath found a tongue ,
With furious haste to the loud summons flew .
And now the setting sun had found them still
Is god a jester ? does he laugh and throw
Flames which would an entrance make
Of drums , at dawn the phantoms fly :
And my tears with laughter see ;
To their ship the scylding warriors bore
Though storms may roar they may not break the wing
And then the chestnut-tree its glory wears ,
And naked they conveyed
In whom the good their refuge sought . ”
Of his life-giving light might fall .
Its shape reposed within : slight as some cloud
They ran thirty degrees ,
O give my passions leave to run their race !
The night fell swiftly ; this sudden land
That gave them all quakings of fear .
And painting saw her hues transferred
And gave a lot of trouble ;
He keeps each sense with strict control .
Break forth into praise of god !
To share his smile :
Till my frail frame return to whence it rose ,
His piercing eye , that inward light expressed ,
Heaven says to earth , shines the majestic moon ;
The petty streams that pay a daily debt
When the evening comes in darkness ,
Their words have given pain ,
Although i make her theme of this poor song .
Of smoke that stung his eyes he heard the boom
Keeping time with skip and hop .
Moreover him he bound to secrecy ;
Do they go for a torture ? where
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn ;
The wild notes and the faint notes meet --
The moon began to climb the sky ,
So cross him with their opposite persuasion ,
But truth taught charity , gave me to see ,
In the rustling night-air came the answer :
The greedy grimalkin secured as her prey .
The greater the danger the more it would please .
One sigh whose lofty pity did embrace
All the meadows wave with blossoms ,
A fearful murmur shakes the air ;
Yet until the shadows fall
Till ripening years have run .
Of a terror which haunted bush and brake ,
How ' dead ' my approaches are laid !
Adown from heaven they saw come a light ,
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes .
His happy realm ne’er held a thief ,
Do n't you dare to break the traces ! "
It got into the candle flame ,
Where flowers are breathing , margaret ,
When zephyr spreads the perfumes thro ' the air ,
Did make to quake and fear :
And my weak life has departed .
The mony come count , and let me mount ,
God truly goes with us our battles to fight .
True to each bond in honour bound ,
And so it came to pass that merlin sat
Which shows that heaven can boil the pot ,
Which a dull verse can never give .
That in my bosom lies .
Why should i confine my love ?
Send forth thy thought -
" my wind comes weak ,
While they the prison laws obey ;
She weeps and struggles , and the semblance wears
As lowly spices gone to sleep ,
About the boughs an airy nation flew ,
Time was when other sounds and songs arose ;
The mere material with which wisdom builds ,
Are one with each new summer come to flower ,
Look to that heaven which never night makes black ,
Then , sudden from the skies descending , came
Each holy brow was lined by thought ,
With cannon and with thunder on our city bore ,
The stars saw our parting ! enough , that then
The demon arose from his wallow to laugh ,
But as among these evil thoughts she stood ,
But , when the battle came ,
In which the soul hath part ,
By vaunting rome , pursue their dauntless way ?
( though shouts rang forth again , )
Not a spar that comes to grief !
Then glassy smooth lay all the liquid plain ;
The little waves patted the shore again
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths ;
As the laird of salmagundi went .
Of lands where rocky summits rise ,
Thus am i still provoked to every evil ,
And heaved deep sighs with anguish fraught ,
Have circled . if the power of sinning more
And quiet holds the weary feet
With all my sins go i :
Until soon his mind turned to the forthcoming treat :
To make toboggans true to plan .
Which to them both doth pleasures bring
May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust ,
And never burn with one same lust of love ,
In heaven , which follows dignity , might draw
Well , then , here goes my blessing .
Is void ) , the same hath made my cemetery
But in the mount that lies from eden north ,
In your voice as it said good-bye
How fared the barriers he had built between
Wealth sought and kings adventured life to hold .
Fresh october brings the pheasant ,
And feel the pangs of slow approaching death :
Of hope to rise or fear to fall ;
The student first the silence broke ,
The rising moonlight 's silver blew .
Where the river ever listens
Where , bound by holy men and lawful ,
Baile 's heart was broken in two ;
Would leave him still a god .
And how a change had come . and then
Quivering , fluttering , shrinking , fighting the numbness
Such yearning as i never felt before ,
A year has gone and the moon is bright ,
Poisonous mists hang o'er the cities dead ;
Put not to proof with the old adversary ,
The brethren beating , and the blows go round .
How warm her dreamless breath does pause and flow .
Not vain the vision which the prophets saw ,
Dank tears drop on a fatal bell ,
Above the greeks his deathless fame to raise ,
Send strange whispers from their reeds .
By unseen cords that no less strongly draw .
I trace this scrawl because i can not rest --
And gifts in turn , confirming friendship , gives .
With lovelier loveliness is stirred ,
Before the old life stopped ,
It falls like sunshine on the road ,
Into the arms of the sea it leaps .
Came grief ; but anguish-stricken was the heart
And purge away their sins with rice
From which he dates his woes ,
Time comes to keep night-watch with thee
His form was hid in chalk precipitation
I feel the spring far off , far off ,
And sometimes when our days of bliss come back
Gentle eros , lead the way , --
The streams around ran witches ' broth ,
't was but a moment -- the blush brought
The palace-halls they gain .
The eagle made the turtle-dove her prey .
And if thoughts came recalling things
That never gives -- tho ' humbly takes enough ;
Brings down the kiss which saints shall not bestow .
What would it mean for you and me
How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around !
As blue eyes gazed in eyes of brown ,
Like that bright portrait which so moved the breast
And in the open air on hard earth lay .
Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life ,
Who leads at home a frugal life
Madan entered the hearts of both .
Move on the two extremes of life .
These mournful numbers suit a mournful muse . ]
Thy days have passed in pondering o'er the great
All worship your fields can bring !
None her lawless rage restrained :
Or makes miss-cues for want of chalk .
And met its rival tenants , rays and rains .
Whence jarring discord hath assail 'd it thus ? "
Dost thou view the mechanic ,
The thirsty rivers drink their store ,
But when the hour of supper now approach 'd ,
And seeking still the pleasure of our eyes ,
Imploring paradise to gain .
The sweet dawn light that floods and fills
One only heart was pierced with grief unfeigned ,
So wholly bound to me , they would have thought
You can not see the future ,
By truths enlighten 'd , and sustain 'd , afford
The friends they met with their warm love displayed
But spread its wings and flew .
Shall strike its root , and pleasant grow
From a gospel ministry settled by the sword ;
In clouds like mountains piled they veiled their heads
For the bright spring sun shines warm at last ,
Lies that deep rapture that comes from being
For talking age and whispering lovers made .
And press the rue for wine .
And her words in my ears are ringing yet :
The dew makes gray the meadow !
The wind came from the west ,
All the court filled with stranger things than he ,
I have for certain put into thy mind
Has poisoned all the joys of life ,
Yet , oh ye powers whose rule is set above
By power of spirit that within him lies .
Likewise how the sun was fashioned ,
Said he would let his old pleasures all go
Then suffered . the other way satan went down
Where earthly aids being cast behind ,
Through me you pass into eternal pain :
The year is going , let him go ;
And somewhat sorry , since it made her cry .
Light after light goes out . one evil star ,
Through italy they reach the port that gave
The doom of poets is to yield .
While coming mirth lit up each glance ,
The bridal cortege passed .
That false was the lassie my bosom held dear ;
Ignores the inward heat that grills his own ;
“ what will my soul determine ? now mine eyes
Bring joy with every beat .
If worry and sorrow come back with the morrow ,
The dearest moment which my soul has known ,
A warmer heart death ne'er made cold .
He makes the startling discovery that langdon is the person
This fires anew marphisa 's old disdain ,
As the pleas 'd verse may freely tell ;
Wherein true love consists not ; love refines
A mighty augury is laid .
But for all that 's gone and come ,
Like a dark ceiling stood ; down rushed the rain
That breathes as light as a lover 's kiss ,
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace ,
On ocean 's smiling face reflected play ,
And being by satan blinded and urged on
Will make death clear or make life durable .
Softly we shake into the gulf of blue ,
Which many people pass for wits by quoting .
And brings a sense of peace and rest ,
Though the dark waves danced dizzily ,
Accompanies my soul and fills , with dreams ,
That blessed human heart youth calls its own !
The cross commands our wondering tears .
Close by their hollow ships the grecians lay :
Is wrought now by a coward few ,
Nor quench the fires i 've madly nursed ,
The clouds in woe hang far and dim :
But the cry behind him made him chill ,
Till that uxorious monarch called on art
Youth passes , unredeemed they lie ;
And read a promise there .
The half stripped trees
My shovel rises to the ship 's slow recovery ,
You ran the race , you fought the fight ,
Saffron loaves to make a feast ;
Where first our marriage-vows were given ,
And she 's a fame that never tires ;
Of lavish nile washed all his land with gold .
That his prayer accepted was that day .
Should seek the fame which all bestow
Must pierce the heavens from writhing hearts below .
In every sorrowing soul i pour 'd delight ,
With generous rage that drives him on the foes .
The light of her sprang and sank :
Some measures comely tread ,
What fear hath stirred them to provoke the war ?
And catch the burning sparks that fly
With two small oars they work and strain ,
For ony wife i see .
He pushes big , black clouds
All set against the foe .
But now , france looking on the image there ,
Such shapes return with christmas snow , -
And the hills and valleys answered ,
And gave such welcome to the same ,
Their fiery thirst , and with each other sat
I felt no thrill of pity ;
The fever die , and she return to him ,
A wanderer 's banished heart forlorn ,
Sweetly , sweetly blew the breeze --
Which held the wit orlando erst possessed ,
No more by him the hot debate be led ;
And the boldest held his breath ,
It mingles with the hues of heaven :
With its faithless past shall strive .
Or where the lichen creeps below
Like black , slow snakes the dark tides creep --
That blood for sin must flow .
And raise a fuss because she found it there .
If i recognise any degree higher than drunkenness .
Pass a few years -- look in once more -
Of the happy days that followed ,
Dust in the dust will lie -
Life 's burdens fall , its discords cease ,
Gusts of it made their hackles rise ,
To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon .
As e'er has come upon humanity !
Bears the cloud onwards : in that tale i find
Ask not how long our love will last ;
“ whose is that hermitage we see ?
Are whipped to show the face repentance wears .
Her words in my ears are ringing yet :
A mountain shake , can stir this man .
Shudders to follow . there a little while
Experience only can the gift impart ,
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . "
And the gray world wins back to her
Yet when a tale comes i ' my head ,
Though candor and truth in my aspect i bear ,
Like little birds that followed on swift wings ,
Who keeps the world from woe and harm ?
Bright visions , came to me ,
His eagle 's silver wings to shine begun
Apart , intrinsic , stand ,
" ah , bring swift compensation to my wish ,
From october 's tossed and trodden gold
That merciless fell like tomahawks to work ,
That all the wandering world would gain .
When sin repented of has been removed . "
One morning , as the flowers awoke ,
Was all the marble threshold flashing , strown
This with their lives they bought --
Faith shall vanquish doubt and terror ,
She had seen them fell the forests ,
For he feels his conscience free .
To bear away from france the golden shield :
And champing golden grain , the horses stood
And with the word he gathered up the chart ,
He kept the faith an ' played the play .
Apple-blooms upon the breezes toss them .
My path is woven in snow through the abyss .
Some power , in my revenge , convey
If yet he breathes in realms of cheerful day ;
The clouds have left the sky ,
Weighed down by woe too great to bear ,
Though disease has not subdued you .
But stern and resolute they stood
Not without reason held in such renown ,
To some , who sit at helm of state ,
In heaven we place a manly trust ,
To loose the bonds of wretchedness and woe .
What only makes that knight the joust forego
Or a mother 's arms caress them .
The fires that rushed on sinai down
And joys and tears alike are sent
To rouse my anger needs but little more . '
Can he such colours blend ?
Set the clouds on fire with redness ,
At length the priestess sought the furthest depths ,
Sudden from thine ashes springing ;
Comes unperceived ; between them , beings perceive :
I gave my second tears ,
Exclaiming , drew me towards him from the place ,
As if leading down to the depths of hell :
He took her hand , he took a kiss ,
Wherein the atoms move like suns and planets
The curling vine her swelling clusters spread :
Now a wild chorus swells the song :
And into his heart a hope there came .
The first year of the war had passed away
Love left one day his leafy bower ,
Let god wash out this record with his rain !
The autumn of the third year came and went ;
Life is sleeping , held in tether .
Or how by folly men have gained a name ;
And so revive the simple-strained romance
And when morning came , arose an uproar ,
Should take a stone to knock us down ? "
A faint heart no fortune inherits . "
And many miles to north had gone
In its strong arms that clung so tenderly ,
And thus the shade that questioned was of this
And pierce the bright regions , which ages assign 'd
Thick branches bar the day
For ony wife i see .
My cheek , where the blushes came and went ;
Answered in the words which follow :
Would fearful odds against thee cast .
Who take in the high class magazines ;
And go against my wish , a puppet still ;
Even while the moon is waning . "
The maiden gave the ring she wore
Each one leads full thirty thousand warriors .
Fixed to no spot is happiness sincere ,
With triumphant lamentation made for each ,
Now empty lies the house . the languid air
Their eyes on that white vision raised :
And the tongue that hung between them , sir ,
The days went over mary , day by day ,
And hence , where any fitting spot was given ,
Their high communion find .
Since satan fell , whom follie overthrew ,
Save for the little wind that moaneth still
And hollow whistled in the rocky cave .
To mend the ghastly rent she 'd made ,
The whispering angels her footsteps sustain .
About the sombre woodland seems to cling
She flashed from out her rainbow as she flew ,
Here , where the ancient paid thee homage long .
Around , his sad companions melt in tears .
The hurt no remeid can remove .
In shape a courser felt thy ardent love .
To bear an untried pain ,
Lay on the soul and grow a passion .
All flooded with the helpless wrath of tears ,
One side they make a shelter for the other ;
Arrest the elements , and stay their strife ;
And stirred the blood that ran in brutus ' veins
Answered in the words which follow :
Still weeping the unfinished hymn he made ,
Which in all darkness shines ,
And the day that comes with a cloudy dawn ,
With hands fate makes me lift up in despair ,
To ease his sorrows the chaste turtle sings ,
But of course this adventure came pat in .
These flames uprisen to forestall my way
He lifts the eyes that can not see ....
May beat a pathway out to wealth and fame .
As once my heart was playing ,
Go where elysian vales your steps invite ,
Their prayer united ever wields .
So mild a master never shall i find ;
And scarcely found spirits to weather the storm ;
Less than what building swallows bear away ;
Her face is grown a knowing phiz ;
Then rávaṇ gave command to all
" the vanished day ? it leaves a sense
To that one sense , made all else thrall ,
Which makes the darkness and the light ,
Vague onyx columns ranked corinthian ,
Far from the rustling brooks that slip and shine
Has come the cause of such offence
Both bird and beast , to seek their rest .
This knave went him up full sturdily ,
Yet virtue owns the tragic muse a friend ,
No watcher there plying the thread .
I drowned my sorrows in the waves that roll ;
Were filled with it by night and day .
Before their eyes all life stands chidden ,
Rather my bitten tongue should fall
And tell how they stood against tyranny 's shock ;
On summer mornings , when the blossoms wake ,
Hear in her voice how youth still trembles there !
These made their commune , when from darkening skies ,
And yet , my heart arises from the dark ,
The rows of pearl that gave a charm
Yet found short respite , for the battle yet
To raise the wind for royalty
When loaded with plunder , yet seeking for more ,
Why such profusion of indulgence shown
His weariness that longed for well-earned rest ;
On your fidelity i count
Reeled as in earthquake reels a tree .
Went forward blindly till she reached the sea .
The direst blow on human heart she deals :
And fury in their stead maintained the fight ,
That should wage war on those who are baptized ;
Nor , if fate binds , not bear .
Well pleas 'd i met the sun again ;
And turn themselves suddenly inside out !
Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek --
How many strange vicissitudes has seen ,
And when the time was fully come
For hope of future gain , nor longer stood ,
That builds each day our heaven new .
With a wild pathos borrowed of his wrong
Then dealt with presbyterians , but
And he spoke the words which follow :
Giving my childhood what it hungered for --
Hard out-door labor did his hands employ .
When sleep and darkness follow life and day ?
As if the elements might come from thee
Had brought our labour 's term , the haughty king
To put a stop to such a foolish whim .
For the outer land is sad , and wears
Thou trumpet set for shakespeare 's lips to blow !
Or whipped themselves to sadder shreds .
In memory thereof , this trophy stands . ' "
Not now those lights were trembling in the vast
With silver heaps the price to swell , —
Are no such factions found ,
The dove of peace shall rest ;
Since nature knows no wholly full nor void .
A nice and suttle happiness i see
Spirits , who came loud wailing , hurried on
The sullen waters swell towards the moon ,
The sun from near-by beamed
Take their sources in the tomb !
The third day comes : oh what a sin !
Limpid as planets that emerge
When so proudly she bore her brave crew ,
To her right hand came the red one ,
To catch the train for northern michigan .
The songs , that make her grieve .
The lowliest duties on herself did lay .
Fleet though they fled , the mild reverted eye
With the gloomy measures turned on strong .
My arm uncertain stole and clung there unrepelled .
And brought the new world to the old .
And care not when the birds take wing .
The flame that lit the battle 's wreck
She softly layes her weary limbs ,
It gave no glimpse of the good old friends
The city fronted with bright fires , and heard
I ousted from my narrow heritage .
And when they reached the yellow sand ,
Where the hill rises to meet the sky .
It chanced a gliding sail she spied ,
But of a single combat fame speaks clear . "
Now airy swarms of fluttering dreams descend
Burnt brandy supporting his animal heat --
To people they look on as having no right
Which only hears the tide .
That thus has fashioned them .
Where bushes over the water hung ,
Who , moving others , are themselves as stone ,
With bitter taunts that pierced and stung :
Though feeling much as if his blood was froze .
They went -- uncomfortably wet ;
With hideous menace swept my eyes .
Lest its former powers shall weaken ;
The smile of heaven lay ;
His dim face showed no soul beneath ,
With all the scorpions that should whip this age .
So flowed thy life to rural rest ,
All firmly fixed in the flames of hell ,
Here , where the moors stretch free
The bluff moon caught as in a snare .
To draw with sinewy arm the stubborn bow ,
" call on the lord , while life remains ,
When , by the judge their sentence passed ,
Turns , and forth stretches eager for the food ,
Her wished grace can gain .
Doth human worth mount up ; and so ordains
And he shall find no balm for his disgrace .
And ile make you as good assurance of it ,
That aught which deepens love can lie
If thou but take thy cross and follow me ,
Which came and went beneath me like a sea ,
That i go forth to war at least agree ;
Her lips were fashioned to move joy or tears
Haskins . the prospect of inflicting punishment attracted ,
Love to each heart that lives ,
A shadowy land has appeared , as they tell ;
So withering ! -- i feel it now --
Whose signal blanched a thousand cheeks with fear .
On passed he , dealing merciless death to foes ,
Of life we gather in melodious glades
The tories seize the omen :
And sweet joy thrilled him inwardly .
While thus their work went on with lucky speed ,
And at his tail flew terror .
May shortly be made known to you :
That destruction may o'ertake him ,
An armed attendant blazed him with a frown ,
Everything said as personal to himself .
To follow and to gaze upon
Bright the small figures in her colors shine .
Is , how can we fool that rooster ?
A warrior 's shout he raised to the suns .
Roses he gather 'd in the youthful spring ,
The watch trudged to and fro ,
Nine ships for the nobility there went ,
Noon ; and the wistful autumn sat among
Of retribution fiercely works in me . "
She swung her golden moon before his eyes --
The brawl indecent , and hot passions drape .
There comes a new moon twelve times a year ,
Pursuit , if any should be made .
Before the lights we play our part ,
For ony wife i see .
I will make answer even to the thought ,
That fed its tongue on thee , would scorch
And the eyes forget the tears they have shed ,
Oh faith , that meets ten thousand cheats
First must trinacrian waters bend the oar ,
That marks the heir of kingly line .
Dawn comes creeping , the weary nighttime slips
That hardly he his saddle can maintain .
Into joy too deep to burn .
You know that i have got no power ,
Long time the chaplains would not give consent .
Thy glory , when the day forth flies ,
With curses comes the fiend in desperate mind .
And anguish thrilled her soul . yet even so
Immortal as the love that gave it being .
The seasons passed for her ,
As tho ' death claimed the hour ,
I steer my voyage to the brutian strand
To ransom him , bringing a countless ransom .
The more we take the better he is pleased .
Their names inscribed unnumbered ages past
While dance and song succeed the bloody fray ;
And feel ashamed ! ... he wins without intent
And that you may good houses keep ,
Know she stands a smiling bride !
Sought to make happy the holiday .
And to the holy spirit , " rang aloud
That you had let things pass , serene
That mounts to the kindling soul like must ;
Not ours to guide the fatal scythe
May not remember , much less tell the sound .
They melt , they vanish from my eyes .
Must sink beneath the chilling grief .
And fill my soul with sad surmise .
Breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me .
And yearn 'd to tread its winding strand .
Darkness has come upon me like a friend ,
O for a falcon 's wing to bear
And that as such i bear about
By the executioner who deals the blow ;
The pathway flowers that bending meet
Who think the poverty of their all not fit ,
Where destiny with men for pieces plays :
Oh , it was then the terror took me
Then round him cast the shadowy shroud ,
" thence arose the violation ,
Something yet remained , it seems ;
The thick soft blankets drawn about your mouth
How thick death 's shafts are flying !
Drawn down through desperate ways that lead not back
As lofty as the laws allow .
All i beheld and felt . methought i lay
Within these stars that round about them go .
Where the tumbling billows the chalk cliffs bore ;
The thanks we to our monarchs owe ,
And ceas 'd the moment life appear 'd .
A squall has struck the sea afar off .
Or fail to follow where he led .
The perfect season offered with my aid
What eagle ever missed the peak he sought ?
Arms for a hero must the forge prepare .
But amory 's pen the brighter god displays :
Alas , the burden that the city bears
On sternest vows his heart was set ,
From prospects darkened , and the purpose crossed ,
I ’d follow this music wharever it went .
Contemplate here the wonder i unfold .
Confront him . chilling dread had palsied all
The message which thy lips have told . ”
And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy ,
Your world-wide honor stained with shame , --
With his friends the monarch / secret counsel sought .
No partner now to sooth my aching heart ,
With light , where breathing colors shone ,
Where soul 's necessities find speech ?
The sweet shrill singing echoed faintly away ,
Bring merrier laughter to your eyes ?
Reuben , all armed ; a certain aim he took
Though on dark woods his glances fell ,
Of all his kind most worn with misery .
But to the cross he nailes thy enemies ,
" death 's swift leaden messenger missed in its course
Cooled the sharp noons and busied the warm nights
And populous floating streets into wild squares
Prodigious leaves whose veinings bore the fresh
The youthful , rising sons of men ,
The fond smile beaming the glad lips above ,
But the pang of her laugh went cutting clear
It lies , yet ere conception to prevent
Th ' embattled legions stretch their long array ;
She feels enthusiastic rage ,
It calls the blessing from the bane they doom :
A little whisper inly slid ,
Himself the shout of battle , then he quell 'd
God made the splendor of sunsets and trees ;
Life that no chance may spare or save ,
Has come the bridal day
Full many a century o'er it has passed ,
As never eye created saw its rising ,
Gives me such vexation ! " thus the
The clouds have begun to frown ;
That brought not a ship before her eyes ;
Which prayers , sighs , tears do show her ,
And give thee kisses cold as the moon ,
Why ask of me to whip poor will ?
Or snow , and the wind did ever endure
Their breath upon the darkness passed .
That set my heart singing through somber days ?
And with pain that shall not part --
When horror comes the way that beauty went .
To the love we felt in ages past .
Whereon hope 's moonlight never lies ,
Gently , and put not forth thy strength to tear
On chaliced flowers that lies ;
When famine raged within their guarded hold ,
The listless day will break upon the hill ;
That made the warty reptiles cold and huge
That color every drop they hold ,
She filled his loving breast anew
And gained a hearty welcome from their loving friend .
The dawn mist rises on the forest floor --
In dreamy shadows rise ,
From his strong bow , thy heart will pierce .
You men that give false worship unto love ,
And force me to a smile .
Her praise to mercy , calling thy sin slight ;
A storm was rising , heavy gusts of wind
Oh , but the woods show such delicate greens ,
Meanwhile the southwind rose , & with black wings
Could draw the tear or raise the smile .
I watch the white stars climb into the sky ,
With all the lofty thrills that through us run ;
The compliments passed between these celebrated geniuses indeed
But what his nature and his state can bear .
The time may come when strangers rule no more ,
Then arose a fearful uproar ,
And now revolving in his piercing thought
Th ' escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks
Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone :
Then follows cleopatra , lustful queen . "
A light it lent and borrowed too .
The sun lies .
For shade to shade will come too drowsily ,
They must have darted from a _ sphere _ ,
And seal the hushed casket of my soul .
That grind the sand of life down till it run
And all his sense and memory fled .
When mimic fight he marshalled . hurrying came
All things with dignity appear .
For that old faded midnight
The sappy billets on the waning fire ,
For these hearts he made for love ,
His curved peak soaring to the sky ,
Unarmed if any meet her ,
Twelve wretches more the same dark symptoms took ,
Then let us , baring our hearts and kneeling ,
Of hospitality shall he find with me .
To spell some message i find within
Nor longer doubt which way my feet must go .
That by their shadows stand ;
To summer our hearts will turn it .
They made yon poet wistful for the star ;
Your truth and valor wearing ;
" that to the full thy knowledge may extend
Facing that stormy-tossing rout they stand .
Till patriot might puts forth its hand and saves
O weary winter soon will pass ,
Where the dim lamplight fell the wet deck glistened .
Thy dreary thoughts will make my festal heart
From the night came the oddest of answers :
My spirit seemed to gaze
And the red light glanced and gleamed
That used to range along the fragrant bar ;
Although to me it come sweet-sad recalling
All thy hopes their circuit cease to run !
That calls the mist-made bark of dream
Through home-bred traitors fed within its walls .
But when the guidance reached its end ,
Where crowds stood waiting for her light .
Then rise the tender germs upstarting quick
Doughty of soul ; death never seeks him
Through love that breathes the spirit 's fire .
Where the wizard 's lapstone sank .
This truth sublime his simple sire had taught .
Or weaker posts so great a weight could bear .
Completes its circuit , then with added force
The crazed provincials drew --
With horror infinite the weapon saw
English legends of eustache are to be found
" and some in dismal dungeons lay ,
And raise a deluge , where the flaming sunne
Work that delight for them may be found ,
Thus i speak , and force a laugh
My soul must unawares have sunk awry .
There lies a basic bond of sympathy ,
Where is the life for thy living to fill ?
And gave heed unto the sayings
Happy are you , and fit to be
And a grin of bitterness swept thereby
To lead a virtuous steady life ,
The sweet blood filled them to the core :
And mighty joy his bosom stirred :
The eager horse-leech fixing on her lips ,
With nothing but blank sky and wounds that ache ,
Thus forcing caesar to extend his troops
How much with generous wrath her heart was stirred ;
Fresh stars shine out , and more and more ,
To do what they had gladly left undone ; "
Forced from their seats his trembling eyeballs fell .
That the dull dust hides away ,
And drenches home the reeling bee
Tissues that far in morning-lands were spun
The blue is dark , there moves no breeze
Where she was born , they reared her monument .
Were thine exempt , debate would rise above ,
To see the harvest of one 's toil .
The withering skull that glazed the eye with dread ,
Yet my heart did not tell me why
Of surfeit , where full measure only bounds
Calling to prayer ,
That issued from its brink . on earth no wave
The flowers a thousand sweets disperse ,
And give to fame what we to nature owe ;
The tide of fond suspicion flowed high ,
Above the wildest wave that rolls .
Subject , compound them , follow her and god .
And high to heaven its sacred boughs extends :
Our birth is built around by providence ;
Ruddy when the daylight falls ,
Hear i noises ? songs that follow ?
So that her honour should receive no slight ;
When sudden a vein of quartz lay bare
Erase your national advertisements of liver pads and cures for
Which an empty dream discovers .
Thus the sad town , which ráma kept
No peace , no comfort could i find ,
The mirage is fled , and the glory departed ,
To leave them . but the appointed time has come
While ever waning , fades the glimmering light ,
And human fate brought tragic things to pass .
Under what colour he commits this ill .
A mere faded badge of a social position ;
The _ puffs _ made me light ,
From where the deepest thought can reach ,
Laid his strong bones down in death
But shepherds hear me pass ,
With its droop and the hues it wore ,
And rest , might lay where she was laid .
When o'er the hill beat surly storms ,
And sent soft waters murmuring by ;
Though the thunder peals are crashing ,
Woven with fantasies , fading .
To offer him a crown , with wonder found
Whose steadfast faith yet never moved :
And his grave has got no name .
Follow , follow , saith the mother --
His gods and ours shall share your equal vows .
And their bodies where they cling are shadowed and still
Expressing their loves in ribbons and gloves ,
While fury 's flame doth burn ;
Her world lay lolling on the golden air ,
Within ; shining with fervor , ringing true ,
When faith is lost , when honor dies ,
And with holes all round to send the light
Since they stand between the king
The heavenly joy that can not find the word ?
Which either hand directed ; nor they quenched
Nothing came after : romance straight forsook
Song intended for ' she stoops to conquer '
Already justice ' debt , hath passed beneath
So there they laid the holy grail ,
Meantime give ear to woodland notes around ,
Thus sang the tender voice that needs must fade !
Nor the bird of air may grasp thee .
And , as vague forms writhe in despair ,
And that which by the red sea waters lies .
To share in my sorrow , no edward appears .
While subjects driven to despair with tax
Astound and full of wonder stood the crowd ,
And trained alike , his bowstring drew .
In his last moments mercy to extend !
For very love till twilight finds her dead .
Whither has the moon been taken ? "
His steps beat faster and he sniffs hard suddenly
Regard , they light fierce looks that wreak
Will gather your harvest of crime .
Comes a sudden burst of beams ,
Than glowing coals , that give them light .
Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse .
Beside his push-cart , wrapped in peace ,
Straining at ends of hard accomplishment ,
From whence the gale that murmurs in the pines ;
As strangely as it came , and on my spirits
That art which faileth never .
Swift by the breasts that must bear the brunt ,
When first the flocks drank sunlight , and a race
Where grief ca n't reach you more !
Now swept the land , now sought the sky ,
Love linked in flesh with failing flesh shall fail :
Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend .
My foes that lay within
He went the shadowy way ,
That made my misery here , ...
Of duty ’s slaves , these words addressed :
Away to the west as the sun went down ;
For my time is come , " said he .
Till painfully my spirit throws
Had snatched from light to form a star ,
This evil came on william at the first .
And my heart has gone aboard her
Comes a voice of stifled wail ,
" for prayer comes down from heaven in the sun
The martial phosphorus is taught to flow ,
Great planets that are drawing near the sun
Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light ,
Morning waits at the end of the world ,
And a word that shall echo forevermore !
To barren hills far southward shoved ,
Stars make the glimmering pool a golden fleece ,
Nor see the banks where subtle flowers gleam ,
My peace would come to me .
Is charg 'd to give his doom impossible .
Your grateful gift and my return shall own . "
This forged plaint drew forth unfeigned tears
My flower of love that falls half blown ,
‘ my sovereign prince , some counsel take ,
There was none , and saved fifteen cents
Here keeps the path of righteousness .
Who fare by night the pole star glows
Even such is man , who heaps up sorrow ,
Through which the romans ' noble seed forth went .
I 'd read the sorrow in their faces
To make fierce lustings still more fierce ;
Whole days with him she passes in delights ,
And haveing therein found no small content ,
How i 'd smothered a bomb that fell
In search of treasures which might therein lurk .
Than what was offered by that valley black
Even the winds disturb not as they go
Had nothing else to fill it . now my art
God sent his awful mandate forth ,
Pleasure and gain therein may claim no part .
Obeisance make , o god , to thee .
Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed
Was by the muses into madness fired .
God bids my soul go free ,
Lo , at last we catch the thrill :
At length disperse this sorrow 's cloud .
And now the old cause goes to wrack ,
New friends come by to give me wisdom -- you
Let virtue teach thee firmly to pursue
Forth went the women bearing lights , and spread
The light in the dust lies dead --
Those vivid drops of light that fall
The swabian land gives birth .
Only made for me unhappy .
Erewhile the mountain gave , and why together
Commands your slaughter , or proclaims your death .
Ere the wintry winds are sighing
And may the night thy wisdom prove .
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
Now , as our tall bows take the foam ,
Broke but the bond of love which nature makes .
Comes a moon of copper-color ,
That the flames may give the lovers rest !
To closer shades the panting flocks remove ;
To spread the news of gladness .
Filled with the pulsing joys that life can give ,
Through the cornfield 's waving gold ,
Their radiance asking , who grieves ;
The turning leaf attend .
Instructed thus , the wise achates goes ,
There stirs a noise , or sudden light ,
That touched the shafts of wavering fire
What good will planting flowers produce ?
There came a winter wild and dim with snow .
To quench the stars yet struggling with the glare
Certain boons that else had missed me .
Their pardon gets and keeps them from the fire :
With all my waters lost in thine for ever ,
Whose late october tints are lost in gloom ,
His dying eyes to mine he raised ,
Men sought for broader , freer life ,
As down i went by rye and oats ,
The deadly blade , and thrust it straight to where
Men 's thoughts must borrow rather than bestow .
Steers on the swelling ranges gave salute .
So many blows his buckled shield has shed ,
Give forth a sound of pain ?
On itself , which then made glad
So scant an hour the sunbeams fall ,
And i saw them go with pain ,
A kind reception he should meet he knew ,
The backward toilet goes ; and swift
And felt your sainthood was no more ,
Which brings us good cheer ,
All its former warmth departed !
Which living failed to give .
Address ’d great hector , and this counsel gave :
Like one far blowing chime .
Each something takes and something leaves
The summer blossomed , faded , and then died ;
Such then will rejoice that redemption has come ,
I could not share in childish prayer ,
And , filled with joy unutterable , i
Scythes that swing in the grass and clover ,
If tenderness touched her , the dark of her eye
In the mood that stillness brings ,
Because i give an impious gift to thee --
The path which duty shows . ”
Here adders coupled in the pure white shrine ,
The shadows rise and fall :
The colonel dropped to the dead :
As doth a rainbow the just clearing air .
Our andy 's gone to battle now
They made themselves a fearful monument !
Seas of colour went shimmering round him ,
' twere sweet to mark the setting day
And on their song the summer follows ,
Shall call an answer down from heaven !
Must these go forth from my maternal hand
Joy can not quench it , or sorrow ,
And an acclaim of angels earthward rolled .
The weapon with such deadly force , is gone !
Of utmost hell , with utmost horrors filled .
" we lift the weight of flatling years ;
When the warm tides of love come surging back .
When , like magic mirrors , dusty windows took
Hated , till truth gains the battle ;
And little eagles wave their wings in gold . "
Where lawns extend that scorn arcadian pride .
Soul , how can you sustain without a sob ,
He turned unto my cries
The place your armor and your name retains .
Awake , arise , thy light is come .
Stopped the pulse that thrilled the germ ;
As the awful rain came screaming ,
Quite forgetting that looks will their secrets betray .
Than that which wraps us in the peaceful tomb ?
The six years had not alter 'd it :
Parted , that bound his vitals , which abroad
He found no joy in triumph ; rather grieved
't is liberty alone that gives the flower
And took himself for pay .
Swept , swept away is my vaunted pride
Which more to heaven than earth belongs ,
And my soul flushes and exulting sings ;
Though such favour ne'er was shown , }
We know that help on one is laid
And these exhausted nerves to strain
The tangled garden lies .
And part of fleeing health retained .
Her spirit stamped the room ; herself was fled .
Whose soul is still prepared for death ;
Had planted it when faith was taught by fear ,
I remember how merry a start we got ,
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
With their blood-red splendor flashing
Or make love see wherein i suffer wrong ;
A sacred fane its hoary arches rears :
The favourite spot , that gave us birth ,
To hold the british king divine --
" canst thou give me now some wisdom ,
And never feel the quiet hour .
The victor warrior came in triumph home ,
Compared to thine how bright her beauties show ;
There lately rose an altercation , --
And he sinks as sank the town ,
That orison can bend decree of heaven ;
Shall pass , this curbless , vain
Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love ;
Conceal the dark and envious thoughts they brew .
To whom thy hands the vows of greece convey .
Down lay the wind , and slumbered soon --
And pleasant indeed was the change it wrought ;
Let him our sad , our tender story tell ;
Some youthful memory leaves its hidden trace ,
He took his part with manly pride ,
Her sullen shade has crossed the floor ,
People , though these men take thy name ,
A toilsome life i follow ;
And providence have wrought thus quaintly . here
Nor knows the fairy manto fills a place
The clamour kept me wakeful ;
At each some buried sorrow woke
Shall reasons find of settled gravity ;
A pale blue flame that trembled on the earth ,
The colours it forgets .
Heaven is not mounted to on wings of dreams ,
As the sea came on them leaping :
With patience many a year she bore ;
The trance that held him , and awoke .
And drank the morning air .
And as a friend now hold discourse with me ;
I do not fear to follow out the truth ,
Together they followed the cattle home .
To guide the way that leads to heaven .
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy .
And the usual virtues came and hung
“ their poverty they hid not , and more light
Untouched the serpent left the thrushes brown ,
Then soft down-dropping , gaudy wings they sheathed
That picks up crumbs around the door . "
The lofty elm-trees spread their boughs ,
Then to the threshold came their measured pace : --
Belly that shakes with jollity , bright eyes .
They had gone but little distance ,
The ballet she led ;
I cast the blood my pain had spent .
If plagues or earthquakes break not heaven 's design ,
Ask the proud train who glory 's train pursue ,
When woe and peril gather round
Our heart might be softened and let you go :
By gladness beyond music -- they passed on !
The golden sunshine comes
That tell where deep the crystal lies ;
For not on thee her father 's eyes were turned
O'er many tongues and peoples , empire swayed .
And he presenteth mis-rule .
All is turning , whirling , blending ,
Shall they , too , find pardon and rest ?
And sway the grasses and the mountain pines ,
And heavy whales in awkward measures play ;
And put not forth my goodness , which is free
Nor put yourselves in peril , and with four
My crosses , visions , frenzy , -- calmly show
Fearful lest any should surprise their thought ,
Then off there flung in smiling joy ,
Subtly mixed with fire that will swiftly kindle
Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found ,
But following wits from that intention strayed
His leave of thee and last farewell he took .
For vengeance follows fast and will not spare ,
What peace they find who there fall fast asleep ,
Where love lies dead _ .
Only the echoing woods replied ,
A bee came tumbling into my ear ,
Wherever fruits of christian love are found
Came the lesson they 'd been teaching .
And setting stars roll 'd down the azure plain :
But after , aided by the friendly night ,
I to this aim each thought will turn ,
And in words like these expressed him :
The finest sunday that the autumn saw ,
Their soul went from them in their youth ,
Answered in the words which follow :
The fraud celestial pallas sees with pain ,
They , when this common grief was found ,
Then this command upon thyself i lay :
Solons to the council passed ,
So here they fell at strife ;
That make a light of shadowy bowers
The silence that refused to bless
Out of the night came the patient wraith .
Now , while i can feel thy breath ;
Whom cruel love hath wasted with despair ,
It would not call the dead to life again ;
They challenge truth . a people makes reply ,
The pleasures read in sparks of substance burnt ;
And mutter 'd more than memory can relate .
And ocean listens to the grateful sound .
And both of them took so joyously
Of the songs that gemm 'd the eyelash ,
The autumn 's settling shades embrowned
Such love would make the flowers wave
He took leave of the sherriff ’s wife ,
Two planets , rushing from aspect malign
Save memories of her pale and haunting face .
Shall be filled with love and light .
Cast the shell of sleep away !
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Down the zodiac urge the race ,
From his black ships the sudden lightnings blaze ,
The speech by fond devotion taught ,
Great summer coming fast
As if to ease her self-denial ?
The random scheme as wildly as it rose :
Blue skies shall rest him in their calms ;
When old age and grief assail thee --
Security hast render 'd me , and drawn
Awhile , her drawn and troubled face to hide ,
And secret seeds of envy , lay behind ;
But not unwept the baby 's sleep ,
And in his heart he found a place
And fed the garden with the heat of life .
A lure that brings the stranger to her door ,
Could be furled together , this genial weather ,
Like dreadful torches , dropping gold ;
The story went the round for years ,
A heart which justly makes the highest claim ,
Of wrong or insult will convulse the throne
Which shows thy heart doth go along with me
The sullen waves came rolling toward the shore .
Be thine a voice to smite the lie ,
Shone like the fruit that glows in paradise ,
There it struck its roots around it ,
To momentary peace it bound
There the bullfinch washed and cleansed him ,
For it thus saved me from despair .
Some take their fare from earthenware ,
Conspired have , and framed their treason so ,
That lurk in the shadows and fill the dusk
‘ i love evil thus to stand . ’
To lips from which it came .
On the land drew up his vessel ,
Mingling me and thee ,
Laughing water draws around it ,
And soon the world to his music rang .
God wove a web of loveliness ,
And bore its fragrant sweets alang :
But he drank the air as though it held
Give honour to the brave ,
Is love that lays forgiveness at thy feet ,
Thy work be raised , the temple will be radiant
The air was thick with driving sleet ;
The evening was passed , and when midnight had gone
Great guns let it blow , high or low ,
The star of love now shines above ,
That goes to his exhausted care .
The honey-moon like lightning flew ,
Of dog-day heat another hedge would gain ,
The yearly races mostly drew
For pity do not this sad heart belie --
Thither take the lid in colors ,
A few dear objects , will in sadness feel
That there should come a time of bliss ,
Afar , ere to the hill he drew ,
No , fate that speeds not will not slay ,
Of the g. i. cans took form .
First the touch of love did meet , --
Untill 'd the land its welcome produce gave ,
Anon would view the time when each forsook
He pointed to the dream that still held true .
A whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side
But the mind grows lovelier dead . "
Or clouds will shadow my domestic sky .
October goes , and its colors pass :
To clear his fame in vain he strove ,
Such words fulfil their prophecy , and lack
Her fury all in that fierce outburst spent ,
Till our strength and courage come back again .
How i had spent my youthful prime ,
" sorrow attends on loads of gold ,
Heedless of praise or blame they wrought ,
In the cause of his country to join .
When neighbours asked what ills such mood had wrought ,
One little month seems scarcely gone ,
Which shall carry its cover and cunningly lock
And that subjection must return again .
Excess of spirits bears excess of grief .
Long was the journey and far has it led :
The visions departed , and shame followed passion : --
Your laden boughs have brought delight .
That hovering wave , arrested there ,
Vexed me alone in trachis , set forlorn
The gentle blows thine arrows deal .
To stay the fearsome noise ,
The herald blew ; heart shot a glance
Now cooling groves and flowery sweets are seen ,
With grief and tender pity stirred ,
And the years have calmed thine anguish . "
And fists of fingers clutched a blackening wound .
Something from thee , that makes it beautiful .
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
Laughter will breathe from our spirits
That takes all else -- the smooth and rounded cheek
And mixed up truth and lies , your ladyship .
In wandering errors of deceitful love ,
Wher that this maiden with hire lay .
Jane found it rather dull to read ;
The woods come back to the mowing field ;
That only serves to make us grieve
Like morn , fore-running , radiance went ,
The nile sends down its sacred palatable stream .
I twine this simple wreath of rhyme .
This was the prayer i made ,
Soon came a third , your love to win ,
Or weeds that to the waters reach .
No prayer but finds the parent very near .
Great fame remained ; and ere it die away
But instead make a long detour through the wood
It comes
Feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash ,
Christ spared from fate 's malignant blow .
The red flag frozen stirs not in the air ,
Scarce one tint left to tell it all ,
Those lips where all the cupids lie ,
That we have got through with the tedious lent !
Beauty in love hath reached its blossom rife .
The whimpering quivered , quavered , rose .
Which put the poor cat in a fright .
Of separation , where there comes no sign ;
By capturing the misty country 's hush
Who makes the good of all his care .
And quick as lightning down they slide ,
And no proud honour to thyself redounds .
Monna giovanna raised her stately head ,
Its chieftain 's safety save his sword ! "
No word was left unsaid , no act undone ,
More shining mark that death could strike .
Turned her back on life luxurious ,
Who cursed the child and left it bitterness .
Who came into two hundred thousand .
Sad as the last which reddens over one
Which follow thou , with diligence and heed ;
And bring the sunshine , be a match decreed
Old winds that blew
Each takes a weeping farewell , racked in mind
Of the red devil goethe bound , --
It has lost its rhythm and lilting rhyme --
Unknown , unseen , or spurned and thrust aside
The pride that suffers without vaunt or plea .
When none may mark my tears .
Or , if woes come , in sorrow 's hour
Nay , must we cut from saturday till monday
And , sadder still , the pain will stay --
And know not what it means .
True mirth resides not in the smiling skin ;
The shame that startled virgins feel ,
From the dear places where thy lot was cast ,
And in his eyes high sadness made its lair .
Plucked at my sleeve , and shattered my romance ,
Of painful blindness ; leaving thee forlorn ,
No healing slumbers coming ; but at length ,
And the fire gives no assistance .
Pined with mysterious malady away .
The bets go as the verdicts go ,
Feed the heart of the night with fire .
Here memory mocks the toil of genius . christ
Came the dreaded epidemic ,
That told our souls of peterkin :
Seeing reason wills not that i cast love by
The furious chief still follows where he flies .
Thou ' se get the soul to boot .
To gain some knowledge of the coming weather ,
That only a mother 's death can bring .
And gave a signal at the door : }
And england ’s gallant sons to join .
But when they fell on seasons bad ,
And make the people here , through covenant
On how much true love we extend ) ;
Earth trembled at it and the heaven was opened .
To lead thee through a better land .
While the inconstant wind bears off , and brings
His anguish grows , with such impetuous pains ,
Surrounded by his choicest veteran bands ,
And seems to link in beauteousness and love
My soul awoke with a rapturous sigh
Where syrian altar-lamps make rich
Their force is pressed out , and therefore flies
To cure him of his fever which ran high ;
She shed , in rainbow hues of light ,
And flies oppressors to relieve the opprest .
Morning would find we gone . '
Remembering him of pleasant seasons gone .
As healthy sheep as you might see ,
With a loud shriek that pierced the silent night .
And every breath was held for very fear .
Of money , pallas sets him free .
War 's murderous visage scours the plain ;
And all too slowly it comes more near
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes .
No dignity they find in aught besides .
They fled to bliss or woe !
Then they gain them glory : they are given rewards
The deluge , which engulfs and overwhelms .
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair ,
Of young desires may buzz and wind ,
Still closer knit in friendship 's ties
And shrubs -- to hang upon the warm alcove ,
The moving whisper of huge trees that branch 'd
The sweet content that gives such humour ease :
He put by woman chances that arose
Thy cliffs arise ; once more
And to augustus they so spread the flame ,
And his strong heart leaped within him ,
And never let thine heart be shut
And livid urchins smoking pipes picked up ,
But for all that 's gone and come ,
Pope , finding little advantage from external help , resolved
And forms the spirit to endure ,
And where'er my footsteps wander ,
And more blasphemous ; which expect to rue .
But i with mournful tread ,
Swift up the run of turf it speeds ,
Hath called us to a high vocation
And gush wild grief long-seared by wars
For battle , words like these returned :
Up sprang a winter aconite ,
Thy lovely smile shall fill with light ;
The tear that gathered in his eye
Where the lost lilith went
And farthest from the heaven which circles all .
She in dancing can best show her feats .
You who eighteen summers me followed ! "
Thy little shining trails of heaven .
Alas ! alas ! they took no heed
Triumphant , has regained to-day
Before he found stenographers were wise --
Heaves and sinks with her golden sighs ;
" but death returns an answer sweet :
It carried a shiver everywhere
While thus approaching sirens sung .
Whose souls are steeped in error
With greasy smiles , their lustful nostrils snorted ,
To raise the sinking funds when sinking ,
Which hope despaired to see , hope manifests
Since first the dame launched forth her wondrous barge
They both were cast into the dungeon 's gloom ,
Water and sky were devils ' brews which boiled ,
With fun and study well combined ,
All thy falsehood can discover .
But winsome aphrodite curbed him , struck
Live in the soul to make the being stirred ,
To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal .
The demon ’s form he tore and rent ,
A human soul , that drifts at liberty ,
Each man makes his own stature , builds himself :
Bury thy sorrow ,
Then earth to them made answer ,
My power shall turn this fate aside ,
They sailed and sailed as winds might blow ,
What holds these pale worshippers each so devout ,
The features love hath made so sweet ,
Consuming here , while battle roars around .
Her evening blushes , ere they fade ;
But tell of days in goodness spent ,
And in this -- eyes of burning sapphire , eyes
Or when was avarice extended more ?
And , grasping wearily his bread-winner ,
And watch the seas glide by .
And prayed the man of god would these unfold ,
The flames rolled on -- he would not go ,
In airy play moved gently by its breath ?
Close ambush 'd nigh the spacious hall he placed .
To tumult every bosom wrought .
Sometimes from the grove 's centre echoes came ,
Shouts of applause ran ringing thro ' the field ,
With the word no heart can say .
Tripping at nuptials and high revelry ,
The pink-white blossoms pour .
And when the battle thunders loud ,
Where proud himalaya holds his royal sway ;
And that your further insult waits a day
And , caught from that resplendent sky ,
And pampá flushed with roseate glow ,
Between nose and eyes a strange contest arose ,
A silver lamp swung softly overhead ,
The devil take the rain -- here goes ,
Who took upon himself the work of god
His lowly couch his limbs he laid .
The rich folks ' motors honked and flew .
Those oracles which set the world in flame ,
To show the beauty of pure innocence .
I writhed , and could not get away .
And tower and court re-echoed her name ,
Making all the paris day colorful and sweet !
Scarce dared to bend her anxious gaze around ,
Shaking out honey , treading perfume .
Of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves ,
And ask them what report they bore to heaven .
And draws the spirit most unto itself ,
The cottage strayed a beauteous deer .
Her hidden beauties though no tongue may tell ,
And on the ground , from sheer exhaustion spent ,
My fury , armed with brandished trees ,
And i think my heart must be working too ,
Where the peers of carlemaine proudly stand ,
From sending your vile soul to its account ?
Wearied ; and time began to creep .
Whose flaming sword to richmond barred the way ;
When the taxes had been settled ,
Scarce had a moment passed , before
Beauty 's long-missed smile to meet .
Religion was invented to destroy
Of solomon he led by fraud to build
Here did the dawn with purer light fulfil
So on him falls , though summers wane ,
When at god 's word the brooding darkness rose ,
Here lowly innocence makes a sure retreat ,
Mute and full of sorrow stood that true one .
Of wrath her right arm whirled ,
A nation now i stand among
The fields their vegetable life renew ,
Those shadowy forms of sleek reversions rise ,
A love that swiftly pouring bared the deep ,
To stay the strength of the stranger 's toil .
Of arid sarcasms , oft poured out before
And peace , by laying fevered brows to rest ,
They shall take their traces from off our faces ,
Let go a music , as of tunes
And shrieks of subjects pierce his tender breast .
The teeth o ' time may gnaw tantallan ,
Yea , only tears themselves can show
Which whirling ran around so rapidly ,
Surpassing , who themselves did make the crown ,
Though cruel fate should bid us part ,
Thy people fathom life and find it dire ,
And envy with their wonder rose ,
That told too well the stormy passion wild
There the seed took root and flourished ,
Activity , that wants no rest .
The shadow there where lies that spark --
To use their wakefulness when it returns . "
The flower that once has blown for ever dies .
To show her pious zeal ? they went astray ,
Of vengeance , sent a brazen arrow forth .
Three hundred years have left their telltale rings
Is there none shall bring thee some delight ? "
" ca n't you see that i am busy ?
Like echoes that revel
The conscious stone to beauty grew .
To bear with patience this great , frequent trial ,
In purer splendour , and restore mankind
As poisoned lizards vent their rage .
As come it will , for a ' that ,
Bow 'd down . the day fell dim
If venus yet had got his nose off ;
Nor can it take the damp , or seeping cold
And prejudice by force of truth dispelled .
And taste and know this misery that he makes .
And over northern birches falls the moonlight soft .
I 've spent happy moments conversing with thee .
With an overdraft that 'd knock you flat ;
These wise delays and cast these doubts and fears ,
The pallid hues of hardly parted death .
There does it breathe a mystic song to thee ,
And the sweet flute bestow some favor ;
Which gave me lessons in the art of song .
Where cruel slavery never sought to rein --
But every breeze , that swept the wold ,
The shrill wind scatters the bloom
And still the saxon might secure his end ,
Whose horrors seemed to smile in shadowing thee .
This found i true by proof , hearing that spirit
The time may come when they may go
So also shall thy courage fierce be tamed ,
Dairymen are making riches ,
And spread before thee fumes of trailing smoke .
An avalanche leaped one spring-tide night ;
And leave the sweets of rhyme , to sup
Bland winds by which were given
No other answer gave . -- he sends you here
The threatening thunders throbbing through their throat .
The chief in whom all virtues shine ,
And little slaps of spray came at the roll
The speedy gleams the darkness swallow 'd ;
And pass their own inventions off instead .
In various talk the cheerful hours they passed ,
That his wife was charged to kill his brother .
To point the term of human strife ,
Supreme in wisdom , ye shall never draw
By every pyramid a temple rose
It blends the perfumes rare and good
But takes with joy the good he can obtain ,
Which evermore is given them for a grief .
And watch the skies as they pale and burn ,
She might inflict her vengeance long-design 'd .
Took wide his range , and overhung the war
While the sands o ' life shall run .
Though more of years than change the quick to dead
Bent to diminish wrong .
I that speak in righteousness , mighty to save .
With words that issued from a bitter soul , --
And glowing flames the hearts assail ,
Mourning for banished ráma , came .
Saw the anger of her father
Driven by orpheus ' lyre away ,
O god , what sorrow remains to tell !
To take possession of his flowery throne ,
And singing scattered far apart ;
Young casper flew to give his aid ,
We feel the millions of humanity beneath us , --
And crush the heart thou has made desolate .
For there the glory lies !
In safety lead them , where the other crag
To the fair stream he took his way .
The grave i see ;
Content with the world as it goes ,
That would dissolve away ;
Then first polydamas the silence broke ,
Of every natural channel , fled dismayed .
Fidelity from her , and this she pledged .
That floated o’er her sleeping face .
Provoking god to raise them enemies ;
The sharp quick reek of keen fresh bloodshed , blown
And now that he has gone to rest
Somethin' dat will ' stonish you . "
Where bright trees bore each rarest fruit ,
It whirled away . cold silence fell .
_ happiness _ and _ life _ to blend ;
The dust of half a century lies
Early herbs are springing :
A king might wish to hold in fee .
Of all that it contains . the following heaven ,
And rise to being at a single word --
' twould make the patient worse . "
And darkness rests where you shed for us
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me
A thousand fierce volcanoes blaze ,
That in thy music men may find my voice ,
I have not brought one scheme to bear . "
He sprang exulting to the sky ,
We 've found that fairyland is everywhere --
A knight that made most heavy cheer ,
Till our cause was helped by a woe within :
And thy relenting heart would kindly warm .
A high-built capital thrown down .
This unnatural fashion is extended to animals .
Follow 'd with benediction . since to part ,
On foot the wood that stretches far . ”
My heart lay in my breast .
When god 's light came down
And the cloud in air rose upward ,
Give honour to the brave
With tiger teeth , i thrust despair ,
A year went past with its hopes and fears ,
And yet before i trace the christian growth
Be not deceived . it comes not yet !
Has stood in the gloom and the silence eternal .
And his eyes smiled for victory
Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring ,
And music , went to camelot :
Dear friend whoever you are take this kiss ,
Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth .
Angry grew and swore for vengeance ,
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
I give glory to god for our battles won
Since she got her annuity .
And through the city 's centre takes his way ,
They wake before the frosty sunbeams pass ,
The splendor falls on castle walls
To sea , with southern breeze his vessel stood ;
Flashed the red sunset over sea and land .
Where a day or two we harboured :
The southern isles shall own her sway ,
That said a woman can not be
The breezes their own languor lent ;
From the brightness of my eyes illuminated by the divine
Holds his ground , for god will save .
Hearts that own the heaven of love ?
He wrought life 's rhythms into song :
Believe me , it has gained in truth
Heaven 's anthem blending with the shriek of hell !
Yet then content would make us blest .
Off sivard throws his gloves , like snows
That scarcely stirs the nodding leaves of trees :
To make the wretched soul rejoice ,
When heaven no longer hears the name of troy .
To feel the frosty air , inform the day ;
This was your butterfly , you see , --
And with the iron crown of anguish crowned .
Lightly the bright months fly out of my hand ,
He climbed through darkness to the twilight air ,
Pure shining joy in thy lithe body 's form .
And on the ground the mellow fruitage pour ;
Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew
But the pilgrim-ghosts have slid away
Breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me .
Thus he affections could or raise or lay ;
And the tunes flew back to my fingers
Stops the pumps that give us breath , --
But unrewarded , when the sun was quenched ,
And do not make the day remote ,
She was more fair than words can say :
Intoxicating was the zest that thrilled me .
That the most perfect most of grief shall see .
It was made for . and after that ? forever
At length , exhausted with the wearing strife ,
One may not beat a stubborn ass ! '
Their soft little kisses burn --
For it would give them joy --
To face the shuddering agony of day
The rivers are swelling , the thunder is knelling
And when to stifle and kill a grief ,
While joan makes boast of a gentle lad ,
That still upon the griffin steadfast stayed .
Of the ages that have gone .
And blew the shadows o'er the spire ,
That finds expression at love 's very source
The supreme soul is seen within the soul ,
It fell be olde daies thus ,
Unto my cheeks the crimson came ,
While seas and suns chant their rolling psalms .
To win him fame with his good bright sword ;
Through his tormented dreams , and finds no rest
The victors see the rallying foes unite .
Distinguish 'd each , and drew the line .
Ye would look rather for unbounded passion .
And other that which the soul keeps entire ;
Nor half the punishments those crimes have met .
His destiny and ours is most wisely concealed ;
Of those who carried terror through the land ,
Though haply sad , might flow .
For this merry jest thou hast shown unto me ;
And now the cruel thorns have pierced him
And faith and duty still pursue . ”
Had never power to hold that soul in thrall ;
She left that stamp of love --
The courage , shining down from one
Reflect what anguish wrings the heart
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers ,
Grant us thy truth to make us free ,
And fiery dragon to take in their fraught ;
The path that leads to home .
And we find in jesus true heavenly peace .
When this vile world has learn 'd to mend ;
Of fireman mike o'rafferty attending to his work .
In the light that the roses made ,
Where the last year 's snows have gone !
The bubbled waters yield a hissing sound .
The river sings , the heaven 's blue
For slumber came and steeped his wearied might
That every hyacinth the garden wears
From the hard season gaining ? time will run
To match our midnight sports afford ? "
The am ' rous youth steals from thy courtly page
I give my soul to burn in hell . "
Thine indolence i hold it mean ;
And , all his dignity spent and gone ,
His aimless thoughts in metre went ,
Were their reward for following billy 's banners :
And make your foes retreat .
Nor less the greeks their pious sorrows shed ,
With shafts of ridicule , my peace invade :
To which all other virtues yield and bow ?
When god shall turn to bay .
And that sings the after-sleeping
A little spark is followed by great flame ;
Father , rise ; take courage ;
My service here to nature give ,
A glance she casts -- then wildly cries
And gave the tones such sudden ravishment ?
And all the mother in her bosom rose .
Holds disputation with each thing she views ,
But my heart it wadna lift ,
There lies the home of all our mortal dream .
With trees that tower and plants that twine ,
That hateful fortune , coming as it did ,
Spirits and stars that hold one choral way ;
Scorned and made use of arrogantly ;
But hope stands by , and lifts her sunny eyes
From city riches mainly rise :
On him i lean when burdens come my way ,
To thrill when the dying sunset glows
With slender stems upholding feathery shade ,
The visions of fancy that live
Is sober virtue seen to move her sphere .
The words my heart was calling .
Fell on that bosom whence she sprang to birth .
That shall make her smile .
The mantle of old age has time withdrawn .
Upon the which is every virtue founded ,
But soon this balmy freshness fled --
Malign and harsh when mortal draws a breath ;
Of blossoms clomb the skies of june .
And but to air her soul its music made .
It 's freits will follow them ;
And spread around their fragrance , as of sleep :
Give to thy joy its wings ,
Could welcome day for labour , night for rest ,
With cares and sorrows worn ;
Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came ,
But they 're encreasing as i find ,
Flashed like strong inspiration .
The azure flowers that blow ;
See things invisible , feel things remote ,
With tearful eyes , pleads earnest to be borne ;
Should fortune 's smile attend me thither ,
And turns her blushing beauties from the gale . --
Seems weeping for the soil it left :
To give no second blow . half living now
But few can feel another 's woe ;
Of autumns burning low ;
Of crackling laurel , which fore-sounds
On these children steeped in woe ;
For nature framed all women to be won .
The sap of fancies which within me swell
The daisies in great meadows swing and shine ;
The white veils swept on , two by two ;
On it came , so sweet , so pensive ,
As satan views his squadron 's march ,
Thy last parting smile sweetly lingers here yet ;
In upward curling threads of fire
So our hearts shall borrow a sweetening bloom
Hence , venus , arms thou mayest take
And as she came a mighty shout arose ,
That all with mutual impulse tend to god .
And peace which far had learned to roam .
The mournful word the seas say
His robe , which spots indelible besmear ,
Had left all hope of life to scape away :
To keep the list low and pretenders back ,
His handmaiden appear ! youth claims his hour .
Was made for caesar , but for titus too :
To winne love withoute faile .
That would follow in the wake of betrayal
Because it leads and tends to farther sweetness ,
And thereby would have gained some peace for me .
Scarcely feels the warmth that lingers ,
Fine progress they make in our liberal opinions ,
Like to a falcon issuing from the hood ,
And the maiden rose in beauty ,
To raise for them a temple-hall ,
Sorrow came to the old friar
Which the first wealthy father took from thee ! "
And against this i bear my testimony .
These wonders wrought in a single night
All their struggles to rise merciless winter prevents ;
Crash and din rises higher .
One day , as the light was falling low
She stood as one who champion 'd human fears --
A wreath reflecting of eternal beams .
That sings and dreams of liberty ,
Believe me , it lies there
But only one unchanging present holds
The ceaseless fusillade of terror ran .
And the green earth go cold .
Her death has set me free --
An ' the best we may go wrong ,
And rippling waters made a pleasant moan :
' and hope and courage brighten in their stead ,
Passion they dare not own --
But for her eyes -- they made
The fear increasing , which their souls possess 'd .
Sound and entire , mark well the lore conceal 'd
Yet even of these one saving shape may rise ;
And , till the chimes tell noon at night ,
No remedy ; the rain kept driving .
His sad looks sought the ground : he sighed
Where dissipation led was always ready ,
To pass the night , and kill the day .
Might make a hard heart ache !
For ere the sun unto the reste went ,
That cleaves the tempest and in angles clings
Touch the notes of joy and pleasure .
' i will spend my days in prayer ,
Cities and gorgeous palaces , where stood
And turn our thoughts from grief to joy :
She listen 'd with a flitting blush ,
And higher aims each student 's heart inspire .
The ukthya followed : after came
The dainty hand which envy 's self hath praised .
Thinking thereof my bark is led
Or ever the life in his face was shed .
As they the market-place went by ,
There came a ripple of music through the roses
Claudius cæsar hath set me here
And loyalty to truth be sealed
That show the leakiness of feeble nature ?
They felt the earth take solace and respire ;
The sunlight falls on old quebec ,
Flowed out from her to light the darkest shades .
The left to that unhappy region tends ,
Which seems for weary travellers made .
Sullen and cold . no force of fancy took
She gave commandment to her female train
Rocked the fire of the creator ,
He heaves no sighs and he sheds no tears ,
A little parted lay the thumb ,
The atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew ;
He will not bathe nor call for bread . ”
Making the hearts of men rejoice ,
Will dry anon the tears that make it blind .
The name at last , sat petrified to think
Then soaring where the wild birds fare ,
' people despised and banished far from god , '
Floating upon a swelling wave of sound ,
While edith by her loved sire stood ,
With trunks that lean and boughs that turn ,
And base expedients , move to noble ends ;
A mellow laugh that falls like silver spray ;
But what a weary length of lingering toil remains !
Or shall i summon to mine aid that god
Both brows a crown did bind .
And with those pleasures crowned be
That makes them grieve .
The youth had fallen not , his viewless foes
Which sweetly tend to cheer the afflicted heart
As on a flower that opens to the day ;
A fox ? five foxes rolled in one a
Leaving both debt and durance , far behind ?
And slumber , that is kin to these ,
The southern breeze has reached the snowy hills ,
Held yet more poison than the air : the skin
Of people black , hath kept and long embraced ,
Away went gilpin , neck or naught ,
Will you bring her the perfect love she gave ,
And draw the shadows down across my eyes
And he has reached the place of suffering now .
And night came , moving in mad flame :
When your heart was fit to break , --
His fingers closed on it in brief ;
And the glorious calm that is hovering there .
His jaws uplifting from their fell repast ,
Which raised an altar and inscribed in fire
His army to our land has brought .
And their tongues moved whenever they spoke .
Your honour again then will i see . ’
We drop our eyes or turn to other things ,
With no police to follow ,
And towers and armies humbles to the dust .
There mercy follows with her oil and wine ;
We hold our birthright all too cheap
Eyes , hair , bosom caress ,
May safety seek in slavery .
And the desperate case asked a remedy desperate ,
Of promise made in stress of need .
War and its brother raced hand in hand ,
Till spring should give them birth .
Live on , and take your ease !
To reach the eternal throne of jove ;
When worn with toil and love i strayed
The graceful foliage storms may reave ,
Like a shy doe that eyes the snare .
It held no conversation with my heart ,
And to the feast magnificently treads .
Whether in harmless sport they gaily strike or sing .
The curtain draws o ' nature 's rest ,
Had crossed my purpose ; then had troy remained ,
It shuns the splendor of this festival ;
The friendship once they gave ;
In charity set free ,
At treasures that glitter and torches that blaze --
' fearing his precious soul might go astray .
Where'er they fix , all nature smiles around
That will take him to his slumber ,
He was moved to indignation ,
Of grace hath come , without baptismal rites
With rising rainbows wreathed ,
O my dream of rest come true ,
As changing tones of youth allowed , and fear ,
The sacrifice , the pledges taken and given
Breathless , the dark expectant millions stand ,
So passed the ever-changing april days .
And stood thyself for worship in my stead ?
Till she had filled the measure of her woe .
When music breathes , or wit or humour speaks ;
" which in the valleys lie ? "
Which woke the trembling air to sighs ,
And long in even scale the battle hung .
Of frighted dian whom the fates pursue .
As they gave him a spoon .
They brought me into life again --
The battle lost by england 's hate ,
Read in the volume truth has held so long ,
Its consecration unto freedom 's god !
And to their father left a load of grief ,
And reverently took up the word .
And thrust her broad wings like a banner
That i may leave a song whose lonely rays
We track 'd the shy thames shore ?
Now through the hush there broke the trumpet 's clang
To rise to the heights of life and god .
Should chilling winds and rains come on ,
Knows that madan 's treasury is being rifled .
In to the life that somewhere else you lead .
As once the nations round him lay .
And from a neighbouring tavern surged a song
All comfort that he could he gave ; though none
And put not forth my goodness , which is free
The which my drama cares not to rehearse ,
Which sees my father pass away ,
For the light that shows the huddled things
Live long ; and though i proudly might recall
None left but by submission ; and that word
With naked feet they beat the hollow ground ;
By neptune seconding himself their arms .
The cedar scatters his scent to the main .
One awful shout of joy he gave
This firmness that i feel about my lips ,
Or glorious death . whatever end remain ,
A being made to worship ,
And count fair prize what comes into their net ?
And white lips moved and moaned . a father tore
There 's joy when he treads the village green
Shall come the guerdon of victory . "
Thy father 's sword and spirit take ;
Enjoys the air it breathes .
Of my charms and wit displayed .
Whose joy no fairer makes her than despair ?
One gust of heavenly song might steal ?
May soar above matter , to fasten on god ,
Your truth and valor wearing :
A heart contented to feel , not know ,
And joins two worlds , -- time and eternity !
Awakens thought and makes remembrance sweet .
And cried with tears hot flowing :
The woman-courage tested overmuch .
Their kisses more stormily showered ;
She 's tired of building up castles of sand ,
Like sunshine when it came !
The quivering sunlight , and its rays chain down .
And flowery carpets lave .
Let us reckon its joys and its pain ;
The child can never take , you see ,
And could i lift each pious veil ,
And sent you following the white waves of sea ,
With shining beams and kindly warming heat ,
He stirred a subtle jealousy and fanned
When madness like a storm shall roll
Another picture shows those woods of ours ,
Fired with that spark which gave them tell .
The army surgeons made him limbs :
Had equally unhorsed , in fury ran .
In the other 's form presents himself the one ;
I felt my native strength at last decrease ;
A calmness conquered out of many a storm ,
But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself .
And freedom 's fame finds wings on every wind .
And settled sorrow on his aged face ,
How rich far round the constellations shine !
Outside the young boy-priest passed singing clear ,
Answered in the words which follow :
That skirt the horizon wore a sable hue ,
As loving friends that should not part .
And evermore the huge frost giants lie ,
Which catches and loses bits of the landscape .
To reach your kindness fathomlessly deep ,
Willingly thy life thou givest
Beat its bleak brow , and intercept the skies .
Where the spray about us flies .
And turned them into diamonds , fired the pools
Unwilling daylight steals amidst the gloom ,
Only to make a colder snow ;
For by the plot thy guile has laid
The ill the new year promised me .
And frae my chamber went wi ' speed ;
Cold on his bosom the spray showers fall ;
He must go loaded with some useful trash ,
The harvests sown in tears ,
On the clever brow he bore .
But who is he whom now she views ,
Freshening the ocean where it shone ,
At _ recollections _ that she felt ,
Lest it avail to lead thee off from truth :
For him thy voice shall bring to hand
The proof might show geneura innocent !
In answer set ? what agency doth this ? "
And the bright morning doth arise
Can make these minutes longer , those less long :
As it flows along the hearthstones ,
An ' each took aff his several way ,
When the evening came my love said to me :
Beginning in the darkness , the mystery will conquer ,
He laid foundations in our loves
Which followed in their bright and stately way
Of hope the praises in this height resound .
Whose soul hath fleeted vanishing into air ,
But should this arm prepare to wreak our hate
Or break thy sinful vow :
Come , fold me closer to thy pulsing heart .
What pledge of equal worth will you expose ?
While circling time moves round in an eternal sphere .
Then many words and heartfelt , these warriors found
This world by fools is occupied ,
The shame that startled virgins feel ,
The red-cheeked apples hung ,
Then ran the mournful message to impart ,
Like a taxi throbbing waiting ,
Like chords in unison they move ,
Should i find no joy , nor respite .
And to test him and pass sentence .
And now , grown rich with plunder 'd store ,
His humble duty left at carlton house ;
Bright visions o'er my fancy played .
' twill live while life remains .
But godlike priam from the chariot rose :
Those stars which make their own charm 'd atmosphere ;
That had so long remained ,
Held in high esteem was wilson ,
Which scarcely stir the growing grain .
To loving hearts no night e'er gives .
She heaved a sigh , and wiped her eye ,
Roving solicitous , no sleep relieved .
But petty men have mouthed it into shame .
They bear my boy upon his last journey .
His restless head just reaching to the rocks ,
And with a look of tender pity , passed .
When the autumn has left you bare ,
Which luna felt , that summer-night ,
And lurid lightning flickered from his hero-eye .
And all our song was faded spring ,
Than fierce desires of warlike hearts restrain ;
Now he is swallowed by the raucous squall .
In her old bosom shall again embrace .
It is but to keep the nerves at strain ,
We take for our musicians !
To a voice that sang below .
The soul , its wingless state dissolved ,
And the moonlight flowing over all .
Great was meanwhile their labour , who sustain 'd ,
More dexterous , manages the comb and curl .
What fascination sang her beauty 's hymn !
Soothes the soul by anguish riven ,
The victory complete and victor crowned :
The old hope is hardest to be lost :
" oh , hasten , get your guilty soul
Above the shore the heavens bended blue .
But should the gate confront another bed ,
As though his hour were come .
It breaks his heart that kings must murder still ,
Laid up by saving sires ; the tribute sent
Legation gentry put on reg ' mentals .
Then our nurst hopes , anticipating , bring
An ' wasn ' there love to share ?
The snow-crested mountains are calling aloud ;
And , pierced with anguish at the view ,
To those white swinging bars it brings ;
' he carries weight ! he rides a race !
“ thy lord his days in pleasure spends ,
The registry and label rested safe ;
Confused by terror ’s influence ,
Transcending all that words express ,
That led through heaven 's wall .
With mantle rent , glad discord joins the throng ;
The wind climbs up and stops in the grass ;
Your bell and whistle put me in a fury !
But since it was lately enacted high treason
Thoughts that have slumbered long awake and burn
And austria bent , and prussia broke ,
Through their pride in him it came .
Pack , clouds , away , and welcome day
If chance so takes them , it is plain
And that stands all awry .
At swift thoughts that were spoken , that came
And felt the hillside thronged by souls unseen
At times to read the evidence taken down ,
Thy thirst , which from the triple question rose .
And all his streamers fluttering in the wind .
It chanced that the vent of this same chimney led
With hope set higher than fear or fate ,
How false its sparkling bubbles show ,
The smitten waters flash ;
And cavaliers give the word ;
It chanced into a potter 's shop i strayed ,
Their bosoms feel his valor warm ;
Her fruits came timely to birth ;
What earthlier instincts we retain ;
Take thy little life away .
But ask not , to what doctors i apply ?
He gave his promise almost without thought ,
Cost more than our old preacher made per year !
That is not paid with moan ;
Permission gave that he might take o'connor .
The adventure on himself alone to lay :
A lock secured the door .
Down , lower still , but ever battling vainly ,
Rising the sorrowful spirit abandoned its guns .
But how she trembled , timid dove ,
Share of truth was vainly set
My love with him doth still abide ;
Where thousand isles and kingdoms lie unknown ,
The wealth shall ráma with him bear ,
" shall crush the giants that bestride mankind .
Life of itself shall dance and play ;
Could my heart more tongues employ ( campion )
Of spring , thy trees flush with expectancy
His fortunes battled , whether rome should pass
The life that hath not willed itself to be ,
The water began to quench the fire ;
Ten hours of sleep will bring you round
On solemn wings that wave but seldomwhile ,
When he found he grew stiff ,
And the dish ran away with the spoon .
" give the word ! " but no such word
_ it was not chastity that made me cold _
Where time 's strong ocean meets eternity .
Where have the glad gods led ?
To whom with sighs ulysses gave reply :
Since darkness waits for me , then all the more
With one clean , searching blast of wholesome fire .
A woman 's cunning to get on in life .
That once was gay and felt the spring ,
With him who keeps his promise well ! ”
The meteors make of it a favorite haunt :
Revolving winter came at last ;
That broke with sobbing undertones from all
As flowers are drawn by sunlight . and there grew
And of our children 's children see the end .
Snow hangs its fringes on the byre .
The wonder of love made visible ,
The friar putting blame on priest and knight .
Nevermore , while the seasons fly .
To give me comfort and relieve my pain .
By the soft perfume that fills
For mark what vanity within it lies .
Here where the road winds round the hill ,
" i have passed the age for wooing ,
The phantom armies marching go !
Which he felt to be pulsing with ecstasy ,
Kingdom of spain will hold as you declare . "
As well as the deceiving kisses i gave her .
With refuse rich to soak the thirsty soil ,
Cloud and trailing mist o'erhead
Indifferent gave to poet and to king ;
Which seems to come like lava from thy throat ?
And the sabbath bells came pealing ,
The scars his dark broad bosom wore
( once she held for true
Yet , as a virgin that heats all her blood
Life 's brightest stars rise from a troubled sea ?
The beam dim reason sheds shows wonders there ;
Which got him a few presents and some thanks .
If thou for churlishness our justice take .
Which would bring her food or pleasure ;
Banished the thought of toil and heat .
That none might follow and go astray ;
Again in folly 's part might go astray ;
Only the mightier movement sounds and passes ;
Whose schemes disappointed have made them look sour ,
Justice the founder of my fabric moved :
By thy opinion , which makes certain to me ,
Enters our cabins and dispels the gloom
Life sweetest pleasure gives ?
Which rests irresolute , and lets it lie .
Made of their fall a path of pity to
And how are your verses made ?
Those headlong furious passions to confine ;
All trembling in the ocean lies ,
There henry 's trumpets spread their loud alarms ,
The air is cold , the vapors fall .
Mortal , immortal , present linked with past --
It springs from the lips of the thoughtless each morning
Do faces of black horror hang on high --
He went singing ; and a rose
They bid her give a long farewell ,
In summer nights to feel her near ,
To intellectual , give both life and sense ,
And more than hundred hearts could take
So still it lay that every day
Have here a speedy mean which can not miss ;
Oh he gives to us his joy ,
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three :
A mass of waves beating across the clear sea :
That had searched heaven and seen so many worlds ,
Round the vast frame , connect the whirling world !
Only it chanced that bound beside the king
Ye that nor king nor emperor holds in fee ,
But the grains of corn went drifting down
The hope , alas , by me destroyed .
My boyhood 's happy hours were spent .
To ages following ,
From the rock the sun is loosened . "
One hapless spring his furry riches brought ;
And darkness settled on the outer world .
Life 's pulses move fitful and slow ;
I saw the race go down to watery graves ,
And the bright morning doth arise
That made the sunlight wretched and forlorn --
As dew hid in a rose 's breast ,
Of breeze lash through the swaying boughs ,
When a stitch in good time will save nine ,
Above , project the arches in such sort ,
Were all delights that made him sing aloud
Or life and all life 's hope made audible
The twilight hath stole over it , and made
To his speech attraction lent ;
And crush the heart thou has made desolate .
Like green leaves caught with flames by his impress .
With double fury lighting up the war .
Might wear that outward semblance of a sin ?
To warm the world and chace the shady damps
And bow to many ; athens still would find
It keeps alive both man and horse .
When will they make a path of beauty clear
Certain good points . he still comes to confession --
They stay their crystal fretting ,
Still , with vain fondness , could i trace ,
" thy verse could show even cromwell 's innocence ,
And all that lay within was drenched with blood .
The thought of death sits easy on the man
And a new brother thou shalt see .
That a message came for the two devines
And after april , when may follows ,
Though , erring , it too oft betray
When eternity affirms the conception of an hour .
Will dispel thy secret sorrow ,
So strong is custom formed in early years .
To use their wakefulness when it returns . "
Or added few , and motion and order changed )
Then were it fault too foul to find excuse ,
They seem to strive and struggle thus to do ;
Surely a shamed head may bow down at length ,
The nightingale that in the branches sang ,
For ever makes their ear rejoice .
The tear of regret will intrusively swell .
There unlocked the massive portals
Must to the heigth their spirits raise
My heart bounds with the horses of the sea ,
Voice after voice caught up the song ,
And now he dives into a rainbow 's rivers ;
The feasting kingdoms till thy kingdom come .
Hail blossom breaking out of blood royal ,
And whispers of the lonely weight she bore ,
And which from nature 's heart did draw
The twilight mists ascended ,
We found that bible truth consoles
Yon rising moon that looks for us again --
That shook with horror at thy fall .
Unto the world proclaim 'd a war ,
Till death all thy sad woes remove .
The night mist runs on the vale ,
The love of thee will set all notions right .
So came thy every glance and tone ,
With lukewarm water wash the gore away ;
The fleet , and here the rival armies met
To shield the cattle from dread winter 's rage .
Each word she uttered falling like a stroke
And straightway builds romances so sublime
Because a decent veil conceals their joy .
The dinner made about a hundred dishes ;
Till shattered on the ground the great door lay ,
The valleys deep , the rivers swiftly ran .
Then arose an alarm ; the ravens soared ,
And lift the lives to songs of joy
The cook in triumph bore that spit
But when those weary days lay dead
Steadfast lapt and surged . came tears
And that demands a mind in equal poise ,
" the crimson tide of war rolled not ,
From his eyes the tears dropped downward ,
Because a sorrow on dark midnight lies ,
Oh let it be where the waters are meeting ,
Of all that hell contains , until
In minds made better by their presence ; live
Earth reeled , the sun went out above .
Ye blow upon the sod that wraps my friend !
Hard held , like a second eclipse ,
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
That made me yoke-fellow of pain .
And titles leaves for simpletons to wear .
Night passes ; dawn appears . carle fortifies
What words can drown that bitter cry ?
She sees the joy , but feels it not :
Of cheerful hopes that filled the world with light --
Some wistful tale before the flames that grew ....
With toil his body spent and worn ,
To watch another 's labouring anguish far ,
With a love that could take me roast or fried
Or with the random swallow take my will .
And on the winds their hollow rage be borne .
The way across the place of combat lies ;
The river 's rapture when it finds the sea .
Comes at last in its fullness upon her ,
The wintry west extends his blast .
Where deeply rooted it will long remain ,
Thus i went playing thoughtfully --
With nameless pleasure , finding life so sweet ! "
And all you ask his faithful tongue shall tell .
" and while your tyrants joined in hate ,
Water is taught by thirst ;
A breath stirs the dark abysses ....
The housewife plied her own peculiar work ,
Of love has touched the fuel of desire ,
The light has gone out of my life ;
Nor is in all an ounce of goodness found .
He shall not find my love for him
His quick-conceiving bosom wrought .
And the truth come tell to me , o. "
The night is hung above us , love ,
And move as winds do reeds or rushes light ,
Starved my soul and gone to business every day .
On the black he laid the gilded selle .
Let thy pleasant warmth surround me ,
There arose a great contention ,
The first absorb 'd in sorrow or in thought ;
Sought to find his cause for sorrow :
And love reduced their shaggy hardiness ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
Where the gay vessels go ,
Death , i say , my heart is bowed
Well , my lost love , you were so kind
Journals reserved for realms of bliss ,
Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe ,
We shared it together in bane or in bliss ,
Her body is bestowed well ,
And seize the moment when the breezes rise :
Yielded ; and thus the story ran .
Such mighty custom 's paid to thee :
Some old familiar object meets their sight ,
When faith is lost , when honor dies ,
The guiding rein and symbol of command .
In the jolly life we lead ? --
Like fire the road beneath him burned .
Amend what flaws may lurk ,
A monument of state , that rears
And when the army in the indias lay
Big men ! politicians ! men who draw
And fate will use a running noose
Some other sun may see the happier hour ,
Were any manly greatness left in rome ?
And damned , and truth stood up instead .
Thy halfness hot with his rebuke would swell ;
Of this too hardy champion ? solve it you
The warrior 's glory and defence , to hold .
Perceiving which , you see , of course .
" her face speaks peace ; while vengeance inwardly
It clearly out , another gave reply .
And went to writing verses from that minute
Even where the fires of hate were burning ,
To such a blessing if it came ,
Alike the laws of life take place
His breath came low at first , then deep ,
They like to chase a gauze-winged fly
And the fierce soul came rushing through the wound .
Fill my joy in brimming measure ,
Light to light sees little strange ,
A waft of it came warm but faint ,
The foul thief knotted the tether ;
With fragrance , too , i own myself content ,
" for gin i find a ladye gay ,
When we draw rein and look about a minute ,
The works of man pierced that serenest sky
What envious demon , ranging to destroy ,
Her eager arms about him thrown ,
The mandate of her queen obeyed ,
That thinks she is gay ;
And i must rise to labor .
Crete ’s hundred cities pour forth all her sons .
Lay , felt not , twenty withered years .
Swells my heart , and takes my breath away .
Rapture reached with tangible touch to thrill me ,
And conscious reason whispered to despise
Her right divine is given by love alone .
And the rest followed : and the women sang
We saw thine eyes break from their east
Encountered , that it went through either side :
And sought the heaven his deeds had won .
' twixt the quivering rushes flickered by ;
Wainamoinen 's tears came flowing ,
From nereus sprung ; the ready nymphs obey ,
Amid which rays herself she closed from sigh ,
Wings rustling overhead or steps that pass ,
My sea-maid , in whose eyes there lay
The first winter which i did spend
Such is the love that i will give .
And bares the pathway to her throbbing heart ,
Which soon made its kindness known :
Can not perceive : that bounding point indeed
Bring back dreams of the days long dead ,
Soon made the sluggish metal shine and sparkle .
Who stretch out kindly hands to me . "
But the deep sends up a dull yell ,
Taking great joy to love the life he made :
His new desire to cruel death should bring .
Tell me , what makes the banish 'd man .
A portal , bolted fast :
Then syran airs held each ear :
Finished thy course , give me my due .
That never air or ocean felt the wind ;
What marvels must the shelves contain ! "
Upon the seas pushed downward -- gradually ,
And loud applauses read the vaulted sky .
That comes to all , but torture without end
Could give no ease unto his heart ,
My languid powers dissolve with quick decay ,
Now here attend to what i answer thee ;
On his own rome he turns the avenging steel ;
Wherewith a prince is honored . humbly ran ,
Hold thy peace above the kill .
Where wild birds sing and ferns unfold ,
Had chance but joined different dice , but
An image , a type goes on before our eyes
That left thee power to stryke :
For him the upland slopes will show
They lick out flames hat reach a mile ,
Or worn with anguish , that it views
And disaster cross thy pathway ;
Seem like voices of spirits that whisper me home !
Seeds , by genial sorrows sown ,
She yielded , and spells of calm weather
To spread his gospel when first introduced ,
Now hollow fires burn out to black ,
And one will ever shine and one will pass .
And awful grandeur in their form are seen ,
Workmen are chipping off the names of napoleon 's victories
Thy love within thy breast restrain .
From youth 's long struggle proved and tried
But helpless , spent their force in empty air .
A man 's success , his rise secures .
Hardly had i the voice to make response ,
In you the heart that sighs for freedom seeks
Of summer spent and of spring gone by --
Till it melted away where clouds mantle the deep ;
And that which makes us most like god ,
To gather bliss from all we knew .
For who that loves as nature teaches ,
Fitting it is that here , where freedom first
The bellows then directing to the fire ,
That on the casket lay ,
Her own voice telling her own wasting woes :
Straight to the field of fight thyself convey ,
The nearer , knit by friendship 's bands !
And the blood no more may issue .
That makes the blood in my veins run warm :
Where anguish never more can rend thy breast ,
When streams of suffering ran beside her door ,
His brown face hardened to a leaden mask .
Then gently fall on sleep ,
In life and in fiction is given no praise
Makes sure olympus , heavenly powers combining ?
He caught within his crimson bell
We 'd gained our first objective hours before
Those crystal miracles gave forth their friendly light .
And shall i see -- possess her ?
Be well content as the years wear through ;
Were poised and balanced , nor the war had given
We saw thine eyes break from their east
Now their broad black beaks they lifted ,
Then the dark ripples spread to waving hair ,
Wherefrom the breeze took life and sang .
And she brought the world to order ,
Limbs and bodies assumed new form ,
Raged conciousness 's spilled suspension !
And shivering spindrift whirled across the rocks .
His talks go down however rank they come ,
One must feel for the walls in the dark .
Oh may she find protection there !
Only the mightier movement sounds and passes ;
Answer in the words that follow :
Skill and beauty both combined .
Who nor in wealth nor empire took delight ;
Then to awaken and find the shadows fled ,
Where the low ripples pleaded , shrank and sighed ,
The creatures of the deep made haunt . my friend
The fell embrace of slavery 's sphere of sin ,
And makes me feel the bristles of my chin .
To this insolence made answer :
They reach them , envy like the thunderbolt
It grew , a starlit flag unfurled !
And in the proof much comfort will i give ,
To end as evening comes again :
He puts the poem by , to say
Another proverb says the dead
The world ofttimes converted into chaos ;
Might cast the great sun from his throne ;
With earnest prayers , the shades of darkness fell .
My heart of thoughts that made it ache ,
I held as one who goeth reverently .
Your years make up one peaceful family ;
Had satisfaction for his folly made .
Hark ! sounds of village mirth arise ;
Their lively labor rests .
Man 's dead , though common silence there dilates
And death on me his chilling hand shall lay ,
Like silvery billows heaving o'er the ocean ,
For ill the simple truth admits reply .
That came from the swung moons the seven
As the novelty of our ideas is generally attended with
Seeking no more their rebel wrath to rein ,
Let 's get to the end of the race .
Where sights of awe the soul inspire ;
Would lead the footsteps of mongrel grey .
How he bought votes and consciences did hire ;
A cold and placid gleam that wavers not ,
With nerves relax ’d he tumbles to the ground :
A seal had put upon her , from which
And hope and faith , with faces set
He courts the autumnal mood .
That beat his torment back to himself ,
A train of these attend her banishment .
And oft i catch them smiling as they pass ,
The eagle that left his plumes upon the car ,
If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest ,
Who only helped to swell his fame .
It passeth vigil and the shadows cleareth .
A horseman , darting from the crowd ,
Was that white web of splendour spun ;
Some waters hold , and shaken cast them forth :
Our pledge that liberty shall live .
Pleased of that time the memory to renew ,
He could find things untaught ,
Cast sparks of fire upon her painted face .
And i have grown in faith and charity ,
And joy came back to us .
Its jaws , by strong convulsions fiercely worked ,
Hath paused to find an ancient thirst renew ,
Triumph in love ; flesh stays no farther reason ,
The welcome message to her mistress brings .
What pedigree the best would have to show ?
Peace , by its battles told ;
For joy finds love grow bitter ,
And ere his hand the deadly hands could reach ,
And with a voice which fear made weak ,
France goes rolling all around ,
And with what justice doth thy power distribute !
Trusts where it can not see :
Faith makes the vision plain .
I think that i am drawing to an end :
Do n't you borrow sorrow ;
And toss their manes in stormy strength .
Till , as the dream comes o'er me
The freshness of the heart can fall like dew ,
Do the lush grasses hold ,
Beneath the daisies , there they lie !
From the spot a cloud rose upward ,
She gave her orders to the sea ; she ruled
King crida 's hosts axe storming carduel !
Which unites my present with my past ,
For it gives us joy for sorrow ,
To give repentance to her lover
But she can not raise the war-ship ,
Which not the world could give or quite destroy .
Thy pines give shelter to his bands ,
A vineyard , where the grapes hang blue ,
The blush of sharon 's opening rose , --
Bubbling runnels join 'd the sound ;
And is not brass by tin joined unto brass ?
For i myself will bring relief .
A voice celestial echoed through the dome ,
Bearing a forest of spears , though spent with toil
And made the darkness glorious ! i have seen
Suppression of the glee , that pursed and scored
A little alligator goes a mighty long way .
While the first whiteness into wings unfolded ;
Who trusts in knowledge all its good shall miss .
His banner is not hard to take ,
I have a secret to reveal ,
Taking great joy to love the life he made :
One leaf the angel took and therewith touched
It woke response of melodious breath
Shall safety to italia 's plains arise ,
Soft joy and peace it brings to thee .
He made his choice to combat in the fray
And the heart , filled full of gladness
Gold serves for tribute to the king ,
Than man may deal the deadly blow .
Of white vapour that whirled
Then came the burial , then the sadder day
His nature with her shivering faith ran yoked .
The wedding night , the couches smeared with gore ,
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers ;
The first voice that passed onward in its flight ,
Four thousand years have run their tedious round
Tangled in music 's web of twined strings --
And the strength of the thin snows pass
And high each holy voice was raised ,
The dim hereafter framed in creeds
Than purest imagination can foregrasp ;
And show that yours all other arts exceeds ;
John dull he found himself in luck ,
A something so transporting bright ,
Has felt inclined abiding love to vow
I felt such anguish wound my feeble heart ,
Sends up a pleasant smell , and the dry leaves
God stopped th ' enchanting melody .
Like falcons bearing hard on flying doves ,
The mate by long conspiracy designed ;
But thy tranquil waters teach
That only serves to make us grieve
And anguish fallen on those he loved around him
And the bright seven-colored arch stood forth ,
With noise and strife is filled .
Truth never shall pass away !
But life itself had claimed her ,
They gave their friends three parting cheers !
Their bishops in their churches lead , incredulous ,
Kabul town 'll go to hell --
The shyest flower that lit the grass :
Who set the heavens wheeling with a nod ,
He soon will hold confessional . for days
And woven , in an hour of pain ,
Yet thou into life didst bear me ,
That battle-summons , pressing in hot haste
When she to whom the lord had given this proof
Unearthly was the hymn , which then arose .
The mass . a stillness of white faces wrought
What augurs when two lives are broken ,
Who gave beginning , can exclude an end .
He kept as grave as the proverbial tomb
The little lark goes soaring high
I seek to snatch from france and peril near .
He feels not well , the work must stop .
Uttered he the words which follow :
It made him whistle , it made him sing :
Which waits them , and aboard the tender goes ;
The time will come when marriage will be known
That i more angry could not feel with you .
And i catch the voice of that voiceless cry
No mercenary bard his homage pays ;
How vain the prize that pleased at first !
It sees the wide blue fields o'er head
But lately come to his inheritance ,
Now as we speed towards our joyous task . "
Her conscious tail her joy declared :
Slowly creep the funerals ,
Take my soul into thy eyes .
Came a stone with rainbow-colors .
Making good riddance of what brush they found .
What vasts the dream went out to find !
And found their gray coats growing thin :
The robbers into gruesome durance drew .
Fair grace of sharing all his riches there --
When the soul rests within the shade of death ,
That lifts and sinks in the waves !
Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain ,
In sleep would run after the wind .
Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows ;
And dim grow laughter and pain ,
To break the silence of the grave .
Fretted for news that made him fret again ,
Whom hawthorne has immortal made .
Climbs the steeply twining stony road
The pulse of nature throbbing through the calm ;
And here is my dream come true ! ' "
Spread the contagious terrors where they go .
He now who sways the tribes of india springs .
For the heavens , they say , have broken
Ignoble impulse prompted thy career .
That girds the home of christian souls ,
From me he took his sighs and tears ,
Should seek the fame which all bestow
And the slow bells summon unhurried feet
Bright visions , came to me ,
He paid his vows to saint and god .
Into the wide stream came of purple hue --
His feudalism was dead , and scotland stand
True only should the swift life stand at stay :
Smokes , nor as yet the sullen flames arise ;
Long through the lonesome night that sad one goes
And round his feet three rivers ran ,
For round they push the smiling can ,
With sounds the centuries shall not hush away .
All other towns , as books relate ,
Can the spirit of life ever enter again
No warring waves break the peace of sleep tonight
Time , give the world for odds , --
Lashing at mark , who turned his blow ,
First found by him whose faith was mightiest ,
And all the countrey stood at thy devotion ?
Sweet peace sits crown 'd with smiles ,
I see that cloud . it makes the letters dim
Christmas eve came .
What shall we do ? how find relief ?
And draws it from its spotted shroud ,
Within its back my place i take .
Ah stretched upon the gory plain
Up came the reserves to the mellay infernal ,
To reach the joys on high .
Red lightnings struck the trembling ground .
And pawing , seems to beat the distant plain .
Like the hunted deer that flies through the sheep ,
Do thou spin a thread of softness ,
Of waving woodlands rippled by a breeze ;
Beneath , a living valley seems to stir ;
To beat beneath the cramped mode of the day ,
It walked the moonlight like a homeless thing .
Pain , which sundered , maketh one ;
Thro the dank dark shall rise ,
But chief to poets such respect belongs ,
Fulfilment meets desire , and that fair shore
Unheeded we should let them pass : --
Her figure seemed to rise more high ;
While life was a fairy tale sung in rhyme ,
As if sweet recollections stirr 'd
They sailed and sailed , as winds might blow ,
Woman assume , for grace to womanhood .
Whose heart has learnt to love and roam . ~
That crowned with tufted trees and springing corn ,
My parting from her gave me cause to grieve ,
Then twilight came , and evening ’s shade —
Our hearts , whose high affections burn alone
Piercing the secret purport of my speech ,
Whence time that bore him failed to estrange ?
Has made a snare too strong
Another race the following spring supplies ;
And follow both the bridegroom ; so the bride
The flowers are bursting forth ,
It will not stir for doctors ,
And they all melt into sweetness ,
Tears bedimmed his eyes that night
Of deep and arrant ignorance came in :
It disna become a forsaken lady
Flies slow the cawing crow --
" the work of pride went on ....
Its melancholy quiverings throw !
The neck that made that white robe wan ,
This casket india 's glowing gems unlocks ,
Eden will run where eden ran .
A wight that will weather damnation ,
Then sudden the order wis passed tae attack ,
As english winds could bring the english roses
To place or gain finds out its way ,
Than mound and stone that keep all virtue in ,
The lips that mix with mine with murmurings
Behold how all things are made true !
The winds came clanging and clattering
Your longing heart held in store ,
The eager glances of the dames were thrown ;
For of a righteous will his own is made .
Through the chancel shot its ray ,
When the state of the case she did see .
Which broke on easter morn .
And thus the shade that questioned was of this
Though the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather ,
Nor ran they for a vulgar prize , a beast
Sanctities not like thine , but fit to bear
And the old wall carries them
Not without fear i bring myself to speak ;
Enchanting strains again they bring ,
Or better , as the best examples say :
In her that woman holds a part :
Not that chill pang which strife and death impart
Shape mighty pillars of resolve , to set
While heaven takes form on earth ,
Pure light that sits on high --
Brightening like sex made sunshine through her veins -
And pray for you ; but all my spirit rests
There frowns the hero ; in his left he bears
Wilt make thy words to aged priam good ,
The lovely images they bring ,
Of light by far the greater part he took ,
To serve her in her every need prepared .
Such ill luck in store ? -- it happed
Eyes are dimmed as by a tear ,
Only the word ; the king must give command .
But mark the price paid for their brief success ;
They pass from dreamy bliss to wakeful glee ,
Moan and murmur through man 's finite soul .
In work or money for her love displayed .
And gently burst the bonds of rest ,
The clang of weapons flew to heaven , which heard
Imperfect , ere its organs gave it birth .
And make us happy in the happy bees ,
As you shall be when our sail fills
Then pity in his breast awoke ,
But by thy sacrament communicate ;
With one good hearty curse i vent my gall ,
Has not come to his last gasp yet .
God made a little hole to put satan in .
Restless he seeks dominion o'er his own .
Mary that made sin cease ,
Tell them to save their money for their wives ,
His airy harp shall now be laid ,
A solitary life she would haue led .
With simple joys the dear home circle lent .
Comes a pause in the day 's occupations ,
It feeds me , fainting , with a stone :
Awakened by music 's spell shall rise ;
For the custom of christmas the other way tends .
No sooner to my list ' ning ear had come
What wishes rose that death might take his wife ,
Virgil has confined his works within the compass of eighteen
Gasped , clutched his throat and found eternal sleep ;
The banner of england is spread to the breeze ,
Until we almost see the great plains arching ,
Her conscious tail her joy declared :
Feelings that lure thee to betray ,
Then sank the spirit of the chief
It sang the gift that comes from god
And now , both leaders from the field recalled ,
With tender guides the soul would go
And flowers aloft shading the fount of life ,
And stubborn oaks sweat honey-dew . nathless
Lark-like sings the soaring soul :
He who the path of honour ever trod ,
A price is found for meat and wool .
Thy kindred appellation comes , and who ,
To rhyme , nor give a reason why .
And yet serene as the descending day .
One age moves onward , and the next builds up
Earth has got him , whom god gave ,
And to his friend these winged words address 'd :
It was slowly coming on to rain ,
Shalt deign to touch its lifeless chord --
The leader , who had left his people dead ,
Punctured by pins , and tortured by fears ,
I felt you growing slower until you stopped .
And all the abbey works stood still .
Short views we take nor see the lengths behind
" and thy bosom no trace of misfortune retain .
And she followed blindly where fond love led .
Those eyes , and drew the long hair close ,
So followed they , with battle-fury filled ,
Unbroken glory , a gathered radiance ,
For whom of humankind persuades not -- anguish .
Sad , not to answer whither it goes !
All fell together , crumbling in disgrace ,
Dark , cedared hills and fruitless orchards sear ;
The law allows you now to go at large
It comes to cool my babe and me .
Renew the truce ; the solemn rites prepare ,
The flush of life may well be seen
And soon found him rougher play .
His dim eyes falter as he scans the page
Was drank out by my brave rassmann .
Of every nation , for all seasons to come .
These were the four loves faded . hold
He little knew to paint a tale of love ,
Moment gives more than we could reach
The springing daylight red and white arise .
In pity fly not thus from me ;
But left our anchor where it lay
I felt as one might feel who should behold
Rushes on , though destruction follows fast .
Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference .
Who drew his radiant colours from the sun .
Save when the heart some other seeks to please .
But jones to friendly belgia steer 'd ,
Frost it came like early robber ,
't is they maintain the church and state ,
In roland 's sorrow his wrath arose ,
Its tender sorrow touched him as it fell ,
No treason in it harbours , nor can hate
The tears i shed must ever fall .
He sets his heavenly melody
The shore-surge comes in ripples light ,
With thirst which none may mitigate ,
With tingling wakefulness that racked like pain
Take thy part in the redemption
His fame hath gone abroad through all the land ,
Endowed with sense and piercing ken ,
And as i nearer drew , disputes arose
Both of the courts of heaven made manifest .
And the juice leads to gastritis ,
As to command the secrets of the soul ;
The seas run high and the boats split asunder ....
And how a storm looks when the sprays are hurled
Faith in that love which outwardly must wear ,
Here stand the courts in which their leaders met !
For his star it shineth clear .
What a change has now passed o'er me !
Never a sickness that he can not heal .
Budd doble 's scoffing shout arose .
Her bright charms who by him lies .
O'er heaven the white clouds stray :
The god they came to worship lay .
Intrepid courage gave him aid ,
And so they fell to quarreling --
Yet warm , nor life nor fragrance lost .
Each in the other seeks and finds repose .
And the pale bloodless bodies wasted thin
Describe or fix one movement of his mind ?
No common things may please a wavering wit .
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Whose ribs even now the hollow wind sung thro '
He quenched the fire , but mighty vengeance came
There sorrow and terror lay gloomy and blank :
The wanton lovers , as entwined they lay ,
From the devouring rage of grief reclaim .
Whose flowers perpetual breathe perfume ;
Their glory fades in slow decline :
And death alone dissolved the friendly band !
Hurling defiance toward the vault of heav ' n.
For thou art nearer to him , and take heed
Red roses swing and sway .
One o'er the cradle kept her studious watch ,
Once more the irish hills rise green ,
For dangers gather round thee thick .
Dissolved his eye , and planted sorrow there ; --
With brooding fulness awes and hushes everything .
Should turn to scorn and anger all his grief .
But ever in his dreams it came
And footmen shine as lordly as his grace ;
She offered her prayer by the cradle-side ,
Ajaces cover their retreat .
Rakes the swift and boiling current
My second marvel stood not in such ease ,
Which heavy breaths turbulent smiting the towns ,
To rid himself of a sorrow at heart !
O thus our nails shall handle you !
The charm , that sloped his fall along ,
Rhode island was the name it took instead .
My peace would come to me .
Show love that leads and soul that follows him .
My wounded spirit : shed one tender tear --
May god withhold such cruel joy from me !
Such as in eastern england sweetly lie ,
Ocean 's surface hid with foam .
Green solitudes with trembling light at eve ,
" although the earth , from which we rise ,
" since this faint heart has found thee ,
As if it spoke to every one apart ,
Could float and wander with ambition 's wind ,
Beneath the god and whirling billows bound .
Her hand lay trembling on his arm ,
Retortive memory brought her youthful day ,
He loves when age and youth are met ,
Sunshine playing between red and black flowers
Ye twain must set the truth aright
The hopeless calm all thought of life denies --
In the sweet spring had weighted many a word
A little agony may drive men mad ,
Her mesas and canon-ways trod .
This treasure the all-merciful hath given ;
It roars like a flame that is fanned !
We take our leaves now of the loom
The heaven of leonardo washed with gold --
Is set on fire of strife ,
Tragedies whispered of , secrets told ,
Known to the roman state my name shall bear .
And leave no memory of the mind that wrought .
And night 's dark mantle overspread the sky .
About my neck soft arms they wound
America has gained the day
Till the great work in full perfection shines ;
Imagined moisture tries to sip ;
The morning broke -- the storm had fled ,
On his honeyed wings rose whirring ,
There lay a monstrous serpent , full of wrath ?
That in my bosom lies .
All my sorrows open laid ,
And heart meets heart and i can sympathize .
Was in my heart when the music came
The ford , and of it self the water flies
That all discern a beauty in his works ,
To hurt the hope that she 'd be mine .
But worldly things have come between ,
Did time allow i might multiply instances
To liquor fly to make them less .
Now have they left the wedded pair alone ;
But thou shalt surely find the way ;
Back by the foot each slaughter ’d warrior drew ;
And follow death ere i have reached my prime ,
Remember your chiefs by his hatchet laid low
Of england made he his own domain .
There lay the vestures of no vulgar art ,
Where foregone seasons set a gentle spell
Those that i could have loved went by me ;
Their banner of victory , charging in his might .
Like red leaves be swept away !
To follow and to gaze upon
How much of godhood did it take --
' i heard the ripple washing in the reeds ,
Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame ?
Our spirits have grown ;
Has lost the charm so sweet of yore ,
Thither the rainbow comes , the cloud --
That led to other men that she had known
They plumped their votes for central parker .
The snow fell hissing in the brine ,
Or other noise made by the princes shut
With his tricks as the days went by ;
One scarce would wish to hold in fee .
And the waves dashed ever higher .
Prayer shall fetch pity eternal .
They touch our country and their shackles fall .
And from its frame a soul dismiss 'd for spite
Shall i these mists of memory locked within ,
The sunlight living in your hair ,
Nor , while in friendship , would their lips unfold
Where furies join in surging dance
And he spoke the words which follow :
The deed alone stand prominent .
Which bold laodicea 's baron bore .
" beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root .
And slowly rising , thus the council moved .
To sit in liberty and light ,
What gentle raindrops bring their shining dower ?
Till the undulation of your longing rests .
Yet all were filled with a vague unrest
Glow with the light of joy that 's set ,
But with our mute regrets there mingle
His face furrow 'd o'er with years ,
As from a lute , that just had found
This well-invented tale for truth imparts :
Came the wind with a tale of shipwreck ,
Then round his breast his wings he wound ,
Then her own people bore along the nave
Those arms collecting upon every side ,
It came about they should not go away
No power when virtue claims it , can withstand :
Wonder why i feel so restless ;
With fearful whispers pulsing on the ear ,
Shalt find acceptance , for a while suspend
Shall find his avarice there and cowardice ;
Else he may deal a heavy blow ,
Where , haply , pity strays forlorn ,
Love lifts his hand in a saintly prayer ;
The profits which arose from thence ;
" the curtain drops : thy smiles recall me
With patriot kings and generous chiefs to shine ,
The rest him followed with a furious storm ,
It could not know a purer bliss !
But his returned not . ever anguish-eyed ,
The world lies , like a careless sleeper .
For the world it lives for fashion ,
Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize ,
The wind was fair , the water passing rough :
Alarmed , for her encompassed children 's sake ,
Where forlorn sunsets flare and fade
Rightly considering it a social crime
That bent not , neither bowed , until subdued
Have you found your life distasteful , 182 .
I will not follow thee upon the gallop ,
Soon as the water doth begin to run ,
Wrapped in battle clouds that rise :
From mortar 's mouth it went forth
But out she went in glad content
Until they shed the taint of sin .
Set the clouds on fire with redness ,
And straightway builds romances so sublime
A thousand hopes are moulded to his hands ,
And feel a sordid bargainer who gives
From brooding clouds ; shadows that lay in spots
And then , as the custom demanded , spake
And his heart in his bosom danced lighter .
And still he would the bloody cause maintain .
His great command ; take heed lest passion sway
Till your spirits be restored . "
Not distant , on the happy coast she stood .
And my butcher shop went all to pieces .
The pilgrims to the shrine find way ;
He set first foot upon the spring-flowered ways
In one thick darkness all the fight was lost ;
And there are times when travel goes
That the weaver 's song may echo ,
The little hamlet lies ,
They venture life , that others may be free .
Thy future rests in its embrace
Come , and drink the milk drawn pure ;
Huge scrawls of words through endless circuits drawn
The very founts of life , to reach .
Of all good gifts that the lord lets fall ,
Our science knows not to explain . }
Thankfully here may slake his burning thirst
" the dazzled eye that followed it ? "
So silence lies on the valley
Sympathy could feel and show
Of eve laid soothing hands upon her pain .
Could i have sunk myself to sound a fool
Yet those lips , so sweetly swelling ,
From that direction hither doth it come ,
Voiced his anger quite succinctly
Anticipative of the feast to come ;
Into an ecstasy that cries :
Oh , there are breasts to bear his head ,
Toil only gives the soul to shine ,
The lily for france unfold ;
With cheerful industry pursues his toil ;
And clouds could pass in rain ,
Nor could , the same supremacy have neared ,
He drives from his nostrils the blinding snow ,
Tears could i shed even like unto a child ,
The piper 's face fell , and he cried ,
Therefore i pass to what time i awoke ,
And down the long beam stole the holy grail
Where misfortune 's eye would find me ;
And priests that hold the artillery of the sky ;
Which made a sea-like music -- mingled up
Their speed still tokened by the fluttered gown .
In hearts there linger yet
From home all the poison taking ,
A note of sorrow trembling yet .
Stormy weather , raging tempest
Hold breast from breast and stay the yearning kiss ?
Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
Shall the sun break its eclipse ,
And set it waving o'er oblivion ;
That rustled freshness near them , as it fell
But all the evil wrought upon this maid ,
Perhaps some swain nocturnal courtship made ,
While all around in silence lies ,
And left the tale half told .
With aching heart , of wrecks that float
From brownies ' hands it must proceed . "
Unto his jaws the cakes cast cunningly ,
Out of the garden where her days were spent ,
Summer , and autumn ’s quickly gone ,
That of his honour makes so passing light ;
That stained the earth confirmed the tale he feared .
What man yet never was given of god . "
When the future that lives new sorrow gives ;
Dawn on its fluted brow painted rainbow light ,
Thus , as the seasons pass , ye keep alive
And fluttering joy in tears and smiles
In all the joys my selfish aims have brought ,
That bound the circle : as from heavy sleep
Well kept the boy his promise made that day !
The busy bullets rise and flock ;
Till the rattling fills the village ,
The wood-tick has kept the minutes well ;
Sweet beauty , that persuadeth
Then my dream did waver and break and lift --
Here lies the road to rome . "
And thin , produced a plan whereby to erect
The next is nothing till thou hast made it .
A golden comb his sister took ,
Where you laid us down in sorrow ;
My counsel wise and good appear .
When earthly cares are laid asleep !
And in this church my faith sprang first !
It thinks the end must soon occur .
And giveth laws alone ,
Whose perfumes still went wide upon the wind ,
That follows with such dread certainty ;
What fond , delicious ecstasy does early love impart !
As if love 's self there breathed and beamed ,
The sun just touched the morning ;
May for ever turn to loathing ;
The ocean swells , the billows move .
Where the tall seaweeds rise and never stir ....
But grace had tempered , and obedience wrought ,
In all her loveliest charms arrayed ,
Splendid blue heaven , has passed from the lea ;
That thy coldness makes her do it :
And my heavy burdens lightened . "
He snuffs far off the anticipated joy ,
Romantic ireland never dies !
Flashing leaped into the sunshine ,
But why urge the tender confession
And the moody man devour it ,
As on its consolations they have built
And gave the friendly hand , and welcome led
Just as god leads me i would go ;
And left the living scandal that shall die --
You 'll bring misfortune with your blasphemies
Than they that were tormented lying low ;
Illustrious , spreading o'er a barbarous world
O thee i follow , glory of the greeks ,
Would rise by merit to promotion ;
Pipe , and at intervals sink in a sigh ,
No faith for " honest doubt " to keep ;
Or can he love on whom no comfort shines ?
But why goes forth the wandering thought to frame
