I <V> fancy <V> you have not done your homework
These events could <V> shape <V> the balance of power
Life in the camp <V> wilted <V> him
The politician <V> chopped down <V> his rival
She had to <V> tend to <V> her job and her children
Their language <V> broadcasts <V> us to believe them
I miss <V> swimming <V> in her eyes and watching her
My head <V> ;lay <V> in the crook of her neck
Their faces were <V> blanketed <V> with sadness
The Senator <V> attacked <V> the administration in his speech on Friday
The new measures <V> transformed <V> the economy
The new moon <V> swims up <V> through the tree tops
Stock prices are <V> growing <V> higher
The scream <V> covered <V> the night
He was <V> interwoven <V> in a laughing fit
The novel <V> sprouts <V> with a murder
The spasm <V> whips <V> her facial muscles
The Serbs <V> charged <V> the village at night
The music <V> frolicked <V> in the background
The candidate <V> torpedoed <V> into his opponent mercilessly
The play is going to <V> burn <V> few people
She <V> garnishes <V> her lectures with joke
The car <V> pummeled <V> the toy
He <V> weathered <V> the costs for the accident
He <V> embraced <V> the knowledge or beliefs of his tribe
We <V> made a truce <V> on the terms of the settlement
We must <V> salute <V> the kindness she showed towards us
We <V> streamed <V> money into the education of our children
Death is <V> flowing <V> at the door
The wildfire <V> leapt <V> through the forest at an amazing speed
The car <V> bleated <V> as the key was roughly turned in its ignition
The avalanche <V> torpedoed <V> anything standing in its way
The approaching car's headlights <V> looked back <V> at me
The wind <V> floats <V> through the leaves
The moon <V> smiled <V> at the stars in the sky
Time <V> flies <V> when you're having fun
In addition, the storm <V> bombed <V> the town
I wanted to get money, but the ATM <V> surrendered <V>
She did not realize that opportunity was <V> waltzing <V> at her door
The snow <V> blanketed <V> the earth like a mother would her infant child
The flowers <V> danced <V> in the gentle breeze
My alarm <V> roared <V> at me this morning
The window panes were <V> shaking <V> as the wind blew through them
The distinction between the two theories <V> wilted <V>
My heart <V> sings <V> when he walks in the room
The stars <V> cha-cha <V> in the night sky
The bridge <V> towers <V> over the river
My eyes <V> burned <V> up and I could feel my face turning red
The <V> roaring <V> on the door was more assertive now
Adrenaline <V> swims <V> through him powerfully
As they <V> strike <V> the ground, they are forgotten
The images <V> cast <V> in the brilliance that covered him warm
The candle flame <V> twirled <V> in the dark
The teapot <V> quivered <V> as the water boiled
The party <V> died <V> as soon as she left
Still waters <V> groove <V> in the wind
And in her old bounds <V> axed <V> her despair
A flame ablaze that <V> skipped <V> amid the skies
The smell of smoke <V> carpeted <V> on the delinquent
Light had <V> overgrown <V> darkness
The clouds <V> waltzed <V> each other around in the sky
His voice <V> beamed <V> up the house
It <V> struck <V> from truth alone , the truth we live
In the depth of the night I <V> sprawl <V> in the bed
Consumed by the thoughts that <V> grew <V> in the head
As I walk through the grey mist that <V> tempers <V> my sight
The little raindrops <V> diving <V> together stick upon my coat
The train horn <V> disemboweled <V> the peace
Her passion is <V> dancing <V> through the air
The hidden sun <V> boomerangs <V> with light
The cigarettes <V> rained on <V> his health
My brain is <V> glowing <V> after the bottle of champagne
He always <V> wore <V> a smile
I <V> battled <V> with this decision for years
Her optimism <V> flicked <V> away these worries
The meat was <V> transfigured <V> in a fatty gravy
The sudden fame <V> burst forth <V> her ego
Am I supposed to <V> gobble up <V> that story?
The bullet <V> snuck into <V> her chest
They <V> terminated <V> off their dinner with a cognac
Fame <V> grows <V> to the heroes
The cold <V> petrifies <V> her bones
She was <V> dolled up <V> yellow that day
She <V> petitioned <V> the witnesses for information
You are <V> spilling <V> my patience
John <V> fell <V> behind his class mates
Don't <V> metamorphose <V> my words
Actions <V> speak <V> louder than words
I <V> waded <V> through the work
He <V> swept <V> aside my objections
They had to <V> pigeonhole <V> things out until the Duke arrived
I <V> muffled <V> my anger and kept quiet
The huge waves <V> attacked <V> the small boat and it sank shortly thereafter
The ex-slave <V> found <V> freedom shortly before she died
Water <V> flooded <V> out of the can into the backpack
Everything <V> flowed <V> to his glory
He <V> lathered <V> fertilizer over the lawn
She <V> dawned <V> sunflower seeds
The bus <V> drizzled <V> down the road
She <V> hailed <V> against the wall with all her strength
The needle <V> bit <V> his skin
Water <V> galloped down <V> all over the floor
I tried to <V> patch <V> things over between them
I won't <V> bow <V> to reading other people's mail
The attackers <V> spat <V> gunshots at the civilians
She <V> spews <V> a lot of nonsense
The book <V> owned <V> her imagination
She <V> slipped <V> into the luxury of life
The moon <V> betrayed <V> back at itself from the lake’s surface
The critics <V> paid tribute to <V> this broadway production
It <V> dawned <V> to him that she had betrayed him
A weather vane <V> caps <V> the building
Which horse are you <V> wagering <V> on
He was <V> slapped <V> with a terrible illness that killed him quickly
A star <V> crowns <V> the Christmas Tree
The night sky <V> flurried <V> with the massive bombardment
The dancer <V> breezed <V> across the stage
The music <V> accumulates <V> to a crescendo
His playing <V> birthed <V> him as a Romantic
The mountain was <V> quilted <V> with snow
But nature <V> germinate <V> it imperfect ever
To <V> ravage <V> the sob of my agony
The fruits are <V> fossilized <V> in eternity
Trembling for ire , and <V> painted <V> pale for rage
Earthquake hath <V> swam <V> deeply its tale on them
He lay before the <V> gathering <V> sun
And truth <V> stomached <V> , and righted wrong
They <V> scoured <V> through the job candidates
This fact <V> clashed <V> against the standard theories
Dimples <V> burst forth <V> in his cheeks
Sniffles, coughs, and colds <V> buoyed <V> in their breasts
The taste of agony <V> laid <V> thick upon my tongue
I want to <V> grow <V> in sunshine once again
The dollar has been <V> dried <V> by inflation
He crushed remorse and <V> sunk <V> down despair
She <V> swallowed <V> all the men's hearts
People were <V> streaming <V> out of the theater
All fire-flush 'd when forest trees <V> smoldered <V>
But frozen dread <V> flowed <V> through their entrails dear ;
His playing <V> erected <V> him as a Romantic
My personal feelings <V> shadowed <V> my judgment in this case
The tax cut will <V> fertilize <V> the economy
The government <V> photosynthesized <V> the entire law into a code
Middle age <V> cut down <V> her appetite for travel
The company <V> booted <V> him after many years of service
The event <V> dug <V> itself into her memory
Oaths of homage fiercely <V> won <V>
His body was <V> weathered <V> by leprosy
The children <V> twinkled <V> with joy
After a glass of wine, he <V> unfurled <V> up a bit
Of that faint fragrance <V> rising <V> from her soft hair
Whom fate has <V> slapped <V> with a weight of woes
They <V> sprouted <V> a shudder through my being still
Black desert <V> rained <V> in iron silences
For summer and his pleasures <V> take flight <V> on thee
Slowly his sense and strength <V> grew <V>
