I bet you have not done your homework
These events could tilt the balance of power
Life in the camp drained him
The politician toppled his rival
She had to juggle her job and her children
Their language sways us to believe them
I miss wandering in her eyes and watching her
My head dwelled in the crook of her neck
Their faces were shrouded with sadness
The Senator dissed the administration in his speech on Friday
The new measures jostled the economy
The new moon peers through the tree tops
Stock prices are rocketing higher
The scream pierced the night
He was caught in a laughing fit
The novel emerges with a murder
The spasm twists her facial muscles
The Serbs decimated the village at night
The music swelled in the background
The candidate rammed into his opponent mercilessly
The play is going to pummel a few people
She seals her lectures with joke
The car smashed the toy
He shouldered the costs for the accident
He carried the knowledge or beliefs of his tribe
We took on the terms of the settlement
We must embrace the kindness she showed towards us
We funneled money into the education of our children
Death is knocking at the door
The wildfire ravaged through the forest at an amazing speed
The car hollered as the key was roughly turned in its ignition
The avalanche polvarized  anything standing in its way
The approaching car's headlights glared at me
The wind whips through the leaves
The moon smiled at the stars in the sky
Time flies when you're having fun
In addition, the storm trampled the town
I wanted to get money, but the ATM froze
She did not realize that opportunity was waiting at her door
The snow swaddled the earth like a mother would her infant child
The flowers danced in the gentle breeze
My alarm yelled at me this morning
The window panes were trembling as the wind blew through them
The distinction between the two theories disintegrates
My heart skips when he walks in the room
The stars sparkle in the night sky
The bridge hovers over the river
My eyes welled up and I could feel my face turning red
The pounding on the door was more assertive now
Adrenaline surges through him powerfully
As they meet the ground, they are forgotten
The images basked in the brilliance that covered him warm
The candle flame shivered in the dark
The teapot shuddered as the water boiled
The party dissipated as soon as she left
Still waters pool in the wind
And in her old bounds vanquished her despair
A flame ablaze that sprints amid the skies
The smell of smoke rested on the delinquent
Light had banished  darkness
The clouds twirled each other around in the sky
His voice filled up the house
It appeared from truth alone , the truth we live
In the depth of the night I sink in the bed
Consumed by the thoughts that churned in the head
As I walk through the grey mist that twists my sight
The little raindrops collapsing together stick upon my coat
The train horn fractured the peace
Her passion is streaming through the air
The hidden sun unfurls with light
The cigarettes snuffed his health
My brain is stable after the bottle of champagne
He always flashes a smile
I wrestled with this decision for years
Her optimism stole away these worries
The meat was lathered in a fatty gravy
The sudden fame kindled her ego
Am I supposed to swallow that story?
The bullet pierced her chest
They polished off their dinner with a cognac
Fame clings to the heroes
The cold hollows her bones
She was sporting yellow that day
She pressed the witnesses for information
You are trying my patience
John loomed behind his class mates
Don't remix my words
Actions speak louder than words
I toiled through the work
He pushed aside my objections
They had to ration things out until the Duke arrived
I restrained my anger and kept quiet
The huge waves smacked the small boat and it sank shortly thereafter
The ex-slave tasted freedom shortly before she died
Water seeped out of the can into the backpack
Everything bowed to his glory
He peppered fertilizer over the lawn
She sprinkled sunflower seeds
The bus bolted down the road
She pressed against the wall with all her strength
The needle nipped his skin
Water cascaded all over the floor
I tried to tide things over between them
I won't stoop to reading other people's mail
The attackers launched gunshots at the civilians
She babbles a lot of nonsense
The book captured her imagination
She relaxed into the luxury of life
The moon winked back at itself from the lakeâ€™s surface
The critics hyped this broadway production
It appeared to him that she had betrayed him
A weather vane crowns the building
Which horse are you depending  on
He was gripped with a terrible illness that killed him quickly
A star christens the Christmas Tree
The night sky blazed with the massive bombardment
The dancer glided across the stage
The music swelled to a crescendo
His playing secured him as a Romantic
The mountain was blanketed with snow
But nature molded it imperfect ever
To scrape the sob of my agony
The fruits are crystalized in eternity
Trembling for ire , and stricken pale for rage
Earthquake hath pressed deeply its tale on them
He lay before the beaming sun
And truth exalted, and righted wrong
They breezed through the job candidates
This fact warred against the standard theories
Dimples nestled in his cheeks
Sniffles, coughs, and colds gurgle in their breasts
The taste of agony coated thick upon my tongue
I want to frolic in sunshine once again
The dollar has been dragged by inflation
He crushed remorse and stifled down despair
She captured all the men's hearts
People were bolting out of the theater
All fire-flush 'd when forest trees crumbled
But frozen dread permeated through the entrails dear ;
His playing ensconced him as a Romantic
My personal feelings sway my judgment in this case
The tax cut will uplift the economy
The government flipped the entire law into a code
Middle age minimized her appetite for travel
The company released him after many years of service
The event carved  itself into her memory
Oaths of homage fiercely succeeded 
His body was twisted by leprosy
The children frolicked with joy
After a glass of wine, he loosened up a bit
Of that faint fragrance spiraling from her soft hair
Whom fate has yoked with a weight of woes
They sent a shudder through my being still
Black desert layered in iron silences
For summer and his pleasures graced on thee
Slowly his sense and strength bloomed
