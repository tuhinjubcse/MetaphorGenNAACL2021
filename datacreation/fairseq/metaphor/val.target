Best of painters ! come portray
Where lie revealed
When howe was retreating , he made him pursue ;
Those waving woods , that shine with bloom ,
The world escaping ? magnus ' fortunes lost ,
Sweet is the page that lieth there ,
Down goes a bishop , sirs , and up
In this sudden terror sprung
Tho ' never mirth awaked a strain
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes ,
The which i mai noght yit embrace .
While sleep takes man and beast to her .
Since from blood poured out rise only ghosts again ,
Nor turn them up to pray .
Had drawn me wholly , to its burning top .
Tortured her love not to transgress the law .
White wings lost on the white .
So that a discord rises among things
Back they flew , and reached their nest .
With nothing but blank sky and wounds that ache ,
And feebly sliding in his son 's warm gore .
Must greet a soul that ached for her
Aye , we will follow the flag
Thereat the warrior felt , and strange it seemed
He added to the twelve ; for at his head
A few brief questions ; and the answers gave
On our threshold a welcome still found .
But catches several figures in its cost ;
Where clover-blossoms spread their fragrance wide
All space would ring and echo with my rhyme .
Which , hearing rescued israel , stood erect ,
When mary stay 'd beneath . but not to deal
Bluster or cringe , and make life
And share what comes of beds and crumbs ,
By medicine well applied , but without grace
And nails as keys unlock thee everywhere .
To marriage state he turned his thoughts anew ,
And in her old bounds buried her despair ,
By it your fathers stood unmoved and true ,
Of tissue stretched around him , shutting out
Though from it inspiration came .
And the structure , as it grows ,
If prudent , age should meet the friendly foe ,
So she put it to boil ,
Love still shall hover around its brim .
Because i give an impious gift to thee --
" a weeping country joins a widow 's tear ;
For to church it never went .
But leave much lasting bloom .
And chanting came the wood-nymph ,
Your judgment finds a guilty poem , there
Still with his soul severe account he kept ,
Which since runs cleare as doth thy blood ;
The need that men feel to create and believe ,
Yet i bear a heart shall support me still .
He made address to her , and she
When the gloaming came that night ,
And fortune , has an awkward part to play ;
Subdued her strength nor softened at her charms --
The coward slave who shrinks aside ;
And find the eternal meanings .
We will melt the cannon back
On the crops the white-frost settled ,
Or souls that their eternal rest do keep ,
The tawny covering from the dark wolf peeled ;
The winds breathed warm as araby :
Appointed at set times his solemn feasts ,
Her ambushed violets throws .
How the winters are drifting like flakes of snow !
Like a grimme lyon rushing with fierce might
Well went the dances
Sinner and saint it gathered them all ,
I seemed to move among a world of ghosts ;
And with frost was quite contracted ,
The wind that comes from the frozen hill .
Sad stood aeneas , pitying their estate ,
And watch the sun drop down behind the trees ,
But that a pure and christian faith makes warm ,
Rags ! and our only requiem lay ,
What verse can sing , what prose narrate ,
Perpetual , which nor autumn sees dispers 'd
Or by fate 's malice to destruction drawn ,
" let galileo hold his own opinions .
Her strong hand closed on her blunted sword ,
Soon came the sea-mist ,
And lost in love , and friendship 's smile
Could make no answer to her glorious eyes :
That door could lead to hell ?
These cares alone her virgin breast employ ,
So there the thing remains . "
He made demand ; and in the stranger knew
The tryst is set for me ,
My bones at quiet may go take their rest ;
Were blameless , or undone . for innocence
At his touch he felt new courage
Now vented all the power of stifled birth
That heals and tends .
Yes , go and carry comfort to thy friends ,
By vain prosperity received ,
Death is drumming at the door .
In forfeit kisses passed from lip to lip .
" let power stand as sentry on every hand ,
And every joy he sends me comes
Constantia took a serious fit --
The proclamation made for may :
By contrast make it bright :
What needs he the defence this arm can make ?
For while her limbs were sunk in deadly sleep
A master passed in mastership ,
The hosts made way for passage of the king ,
But beauty 's only meant for love .
Would work like resurrection on the mind ,
They also brought of misadventure sad
Of elm trees , newly coming into bud ,
The fibre hid , and through the vital parts
Of rome , enslaved , is stirring into life ;
The attending heralds , as by office bound ,
To light the hunt until the quarry 's won .
Thus took they congee , and the angry knight
So few are now the feet that pass ;
Here they lie , had realms and lands ,
To bring a bloom up to the sun
The appetite remains , that this is ask 'd ,
Nor the bird of air did grasp him .
My soul goes clad in gorgeous things ,
When him a melancholy voice addressed ;
That manhood 's powers employ ,
And clouds are passing , and banks stretch wide ,
Of lively portraiture displayed ,
What do i gain that am myself undone ?
Went on from bad to worse ,
Wave o'er the cloud of saxon war ,
Their music never gone .
Till it touched the top of heaven ,
Whom nature hath made apt for every change !
And hands to make his hands rejoice ,
What horror was encompassed in that small hot bird .
With asses all his time he spent ,
" and then the doom foreseen upon me fell ,
“ dismiss , dismiss thine idle fear ,
Two strangers haste to join his train .
That jupiter supreme still held the throne .
Come on the paladins and ladies all .
Thy world and mine , the eternal victory seen !
To pass delay not , urged by blows behind ;
Nor with the scoffers go :
How supplejoints a lesson got
And , better far , a heart that feels
That leaves him careless ' mid his dead ,
In stars , she beckons to america , the land
And gild our chamber ceilings as they pass ,
In that lake of tears which my grief discovered ,
This he had held above all others dear ;
“ while on her hearth lay blazing many a piece
Within the gates his way he made ;
And weariness was balanced with delight ,
And been by gryphon foully brought to scorn ;
And its perplexed paths no more can trace ;
Great merion follows , and new shouts arise :
Covers some separate truth that we may know .
For { books belong to husbands and to brothers .
But this descended from the bless 'd abodes ,
The curtain draws o ' nature 's rest ,
And take the harmless folly of the time !
Who counts i ween two hundred years ,
- the few steps taken at a funeral pace
I leave to thee the mode of dying , "
Doth human worth mount up ; and so ordains
Which , whirling round , ran on so rapidly ,
To him i take my fear ,
Princess , give ear to this my summary ;
My youth and joy consume .
Who made through cowardice the great refusal .
Gold bands his raised hoof guarded ,
Till each rivet feels the strain ,
Shouldst not tear my veins asunder . "
Lock 'd rotting rooms her eyes must never scan ,
But human nature feels .
But how acquire the meaning of the signs ?
To adam what shall come in future dayes ,
But all abstracts of rarities are laid ,
And drive the harpies from their native reign ?
On the morrow stood to challenge ; in their strength
The finest organ , and informed by mind .
And my poor words are lost amid that throng ,
Of his ally seek vengeance , destroying perchance
And the rifles snapped their hate ,
Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew ,
And within it came a people
And cold the wind that wanders round
That left me alone in the strife ,
Latona gave thy life to thee ,
" ring out the thousand wars of old ,
Shall melt the snaws of age ;
And it drives the sleet and the snow .
Come on , cried sanctimonius ,
But still one task remained to do ;
She never gave . no word , no motion ,
And gave them to his warrior train in charge .
The chanting pythoness gave oracle ,
" i should curse the hour that bore me ,
There 's never a scot shall set ye free :
In other days ere joy had left this brow ;
We bear the name that marks our race ;
Whether need of gold should tempt thee ,
Where liberty shall firmly stand ,
A bird of prey , with talons reeking ,
We scarce could do better than form an alliance ,
One lays the mango garden low ,
And though her tresses fell but in such guise
To shed their tears around his tomb .
His will lost control ; and long fettered desire
In streets where stood their rosy stalls ,
And all his vengeance noted .
The bugle 's gone for smoke and play ;
Hence comes the indian-summer bloom
And to suggest one counsel they combine .
The first said : " i have found a king
To clear that mortgage , to pay that debt .
Which hid the holiest from the people 's eyes
It fell to me and a man i know ,
But naught of our flag can lend .
To watch the clouds go trailing by ?
Lest , thus encompassed with funereal gloom ,
Whilst on each face the embers shine ,
Take care that in our members life remains .
Which by kind sorrow 's ministry hath learned
To whom dominion o'er the rest belongs .
There comes his veilèd destiny ;
Nor , till the sun had gone to bed ,
And those mute lips to smiles had moved ;
They set the old echoes calling :
The marsh-grass mingles with the flowers ,
On the sleeper 's ear those rich notes stealing ,
Sapped by corruption to itself absorbed .
Through the thought still spread beyond her :
Shall add one word , to tell
In public loss to shed a tear ,
Mercy soon gathered her to praise above .
I see my coming has but mischief wrought .
And whoever it touch 'd was made clean !
And conscience , truth , and honesty are made
Of weary fibres stretched with toil ,
Should be made better for the life of man --
And with his words new rapture woke :
They give us battle , through our leader 's fault
Content , thine equal , bound in faithful peace ,
I felt no fear ; the one who waited there
Many dreary days have wandered ,
Nor envy found a place .
The old man , broken and propless quite .
Screeched out a song , to cheer my grief ;
And there the body lay , age after age .
That i shall make no mournful cry :
A king might wish to hold in fee .
With truth i answer ; thou the truth attend .
Was strengthened in the hate she nursed before .
Approaching fights , and fields to float in blood .
But nature renders it imperfect ever ,
Such order gave huge ajax ; purple gore
Before the last went , heavy with dew ,
" unhappy guest ! whose sorrows touch my mind !
Who lends fresh beauty to the morning light ,
With the cud that made it swell .
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
As golden balls with laughter lightly tossed ,
While my life and taste remain ,
And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan .
To make the scene more fair ;
Your friend is dead , " i ventured .
( a gray east , flecked with rosy day )
Hast rendered me security , and drawn me
And summer come wi ' joy ,
A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest .
To strangle the sob of my agony .
Does it mean that i love again ?
A floating dream of dread , upon the deep ;
The devil takes sweet shapes when he tells lies .
And the drums strike more convulsive ,
Oh , give me death or liberty !
The nymph found breath to shake and thrill ;
" it will not go for nought . "
The feather 'd arrow gave a dire portent ,
I laughed to find them aching ,
Might raise musaeus from his bower ,
To raise its genius , and direct its rage .
But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
The warly race may riches chase ,
Follow thy footsteps to the realms below --
With years and spheres that roll ,
With boughs that quaked at every breath ,
Then shall the church in rapturous numbers sing ,
The western republic will carry it through -- :
The father , so far yielding as to humor
But little time had eased her drooping head ,
Victorious he his mighty triumph holds ,
She shrinks reluctant to the deep , such dread
With pity moved , exhorted mercury
Thy tears and all thy songs to follow .
With thee , and then it stirs alert ,
A glory i shall not find .
What sleight had she the wardens to betray ?
With transports trembling upon pain ,
Save of blown self-applause , they proudly mount
And make that bright revealment known
Shine upon my lowly grave ,
From out the ashes rose .
A death he once had held most fair ;
Wee must that discord surely call ,
In life ’s best joys my share have borne ;
Big ships with sails spread to the breeze ;
Two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain .
Or generous draft , conceded as a gift ,
Are stirring like sweet maidens when they dream .
And curled like serpents which unfold .
And the more ample years unfold
Made filthy mixture , with steps taken slow ;
Is there no term of suffering lying before thee ?
The sun had reached the crab at morn
And dropped on his beard so gray .
From his pure fountains ran two streams likewise ,
When overcome 't is swallowed by the sea .
May bear some witness to my virtuous spring ,
And meekly took what fortune sent :
Where dionean caesar 's star comes forth
A flare went up ; the shining whiteness spread
Before me took his spectral stand ,
And giving voice to tears ,
The fruits are garnered in eternity ,
Strong in a fate set free ,
Where not to vile fanatic passion urged ,
Whose snorting nostrils breathe the flames of fire .
Thy war ( discreetly made ) with white success .
What could he see but mightily he noted ?
With courage meet the sacrifice .
Nor ask of grace from fair ladye . "
Death and anguish send ? " he cries , --
Wide the new world had opened its bright gates .
Her white feet go glimmering
And life 's fine loyalties are turned to jest ,
Thus the golden moon makes answer :
The parakeets go screaming by
My apprehensions come in crowds ;
And all the trembling flowers they bear .
Her forming hand gave shape unto the name .
Death will quickly fall upon me ,
With brimming glass that spilled the toast ,
While ilion like a mist rose into towers .
For their amusements never cloy ,
His wheels settles -- what shall men see then ?
One lonely day — another came in sadness ;
No music that the robin spouts
Now dimmed with incense from diana 's shrine ,
With music wrought of distraction his heart enlarged .
Our perfect union would be made complete :
Held moons and planets to their constant road
Are hid the hearts of all the ranging seas --
To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire :
Few steps we made until we there had come ,
He washed his soul from sin 's dark trace ,
That the long years spin in the outs and ins
" whilst thou slept , i fell to musing
Who guarded through the centuries his race .
Yet faithful to its trust remaining .
Beating out their futile tune ,
From my weak heart the swelling emptiness .
And whispering fear has come instead .
And his health goes briskly all day round .
Where the dusky warp we strain , --
The little gate was reached at last ,
Britain , aspiring briton , now must bend --
How comes that lovely casket here to me ?
That takes and re-delivers every stroke
And i ne'er knew what music meant ,
Fame starts astonished at such prizes won ,
Of the devouring courts of law ;
So rollant felt his sword was taken forth ,
Wherein a firebrand gave a dreadful light ,
She shall run upon your errands ,
And gave to fancy all her youthful mind .
Soft on thee fall the breath of time ,
To make them look so gay ?
And gave the seasons chase ,
Are rare . with this distinction take my words ;
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
The dear , brown eyes their answer gave ;
Gives hope and fervor , nearer draws his theme
The essence that alone makes love divine --
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue .
And yield such piercing pain they ca n't hold out
Trembling for ire , and waxing pale for rage ,
Thus , while in equal scales their fortune stood
Through the vast assembly ran .
But virtue hath transform 'd all change to grace :
Light have ye still to follow evil or good ,
May find as dear a nurse at need ,
He crushed remorse and wrestled down despair :
She gave surrender to abducting arms .
Eurytion to his brother breathed a prayer ,
Hard battle for us , furnishing with arms
Their superstitions made them ready prey ;
More black than bright , commending death
I felt myself a ghost , and seemed to be
Thy ray could pierce , and answer have .
With the blight of death it carried ?
By whose fell craft his mother died :
Since sorrows die ;
The torrent 's thunder sunk into a sigh ;
We lapped the grass on that youngling spring ;
For , is this emmy that i see ?
Made such a voluble answer promising all ,
Of matter , from their old arrangements stirred
Never was blast from vapour charged with cold ,
Who guarded right , and kept his people free ;
Nor shows the argive story of ilium ,
On duties well performed , and days well spent !
But here is nought with grief to strive .
His great mare made the hoof-casts fly .
Through all my pulses run ;
Opinions ? they still take a wider range :
Not worlds could keep her from his arms away ,
Thieves set upon them furiously ,
Where bargains meet for purses spare ,
Where genius all his light reveals --
Must join the north and south in every good ,
When trembling night-winds whistle
That by their own gay light were eat up .
In the holy temple making her amends ,
What stealthy footstep followed her ?
Who pale with fear the rending earth survey
Earthquake hath registered deeply its tale on them --
But i jumped to feel how sharp had been
Who holds o'er all my faculties control
He lay before the breaking sun ,
The number made the motion slower .
How have the raptur 'd moments flown !
The talk about the wondrous circus ran .
And truth upheld , and righted wrong ,
While joy gave clouds the light of stars ,
With wicker arks did come
And treading in my footsteps , hail new worlds ,
And wondered when i made reply ,
So the figures of this song grew --
I courted twenty years , ochone !
Who ever sought his loved ones ’ bliss .
The cold dust shall inform , and make
Friends , who set forth at our side ,
To joy and ease their days they give ,
The kite rose up . his honest heart
We loaf where the wind-spilled fountain plays .
The brightest truths that man has ever seen .
A spell which thou , hast felt ,
Forced into virtue thus by self-defence ,
Gives us a sense of the awe ,
Had leaned , and left a soft impress .
Rich in each charm that wakes desire ,
No wing material lifts our mortal clay .
And her eyes fill with tears ;
Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal ,
Shakes the sacred lodge with terror ,
And the rough hazels climb along the beach .
Back through the streets that echo at your tread --
The fruitful bough they bore .
Springing ' neath your careless tread .
The warrior 's gyves no sooner they undo ,
It clasped her neck and fell asleep .
The message brought was for the king design 'd .
A rose whose crimson breath revealed
As hope was rising in his breast :
Like the great sun who fires the skies ,
How the allotted income went ,
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling .
Here lie the chronicles that told
An angel bends from every cloud that rolls ;
Mind remained silent . i pressed for an answer .
That saw his royal standard laid on ground ,
And the moon never stares but it brings me nightmares
That better time , for which the patriots yearn ,
And brilliant treasure it may hold .
And in thy joyous errand reach the spot
A hermit ’s home should ever shun .
Honour , be sure , and duty strongly sways :
Strike ! with every blow is given
And swept beyond the brink of sense ,
Seem to pierce the wintry sky ,
Then a long silence came upon the hall ,
The warmth of lips that meet your own ,
Whereas it is noah , commanding the ark .
Could match the smile of jean .
The bath preparing for her lord ’s return
So that from me the shadow reached the rock ,
And union find in freedom ?
Through love to kindle in our souls the more .
The fate of a nation was riding that night .
And well his mighty puissance testified ,
The clock struck one ,
" this foolish tear will quench my fire ,
And i must take my cross on me
He made no effort to outlive his land ;
That with their weight they make the balances
Keep faith , a knight that hath to name
And makes the heart in love with night .
The boyish old man whom no fate ever floored ;
But just the wine went drop and drip ;
Should be that eastern star for guidance lent ,
Lo , at last have found our way .
" from the bears ' mouths foam was dropping ,
Up and down went youth in mountain ,
Shown resentment at the outrage .
Which served for that titanic strife .
It stiffened to royal-erect ;
And the dire passage down to hell descends .
Should lead the melancholy chorus ; they
Which having passed and yielded him small treasure ,
The cold spring scoops its hollow ;
This consciousness must purify ,
Voice after voice caught up the song ,
He is kind , and comfort gives
Pleasures come , if sorrows follow :
While the red logs before us beat
What pain could get between my face and hers ?
Of holy dreams which come to us at night ,
Ah , woe to women death passes o'er !
It yielded to my touch . some careless hand
His beating bosom claim ’d the rising fight .
Many and beautiful lay those around ,
Took such affection , whom she held so dear ,
A slender streak of blood announced how near
Herself transfigured as jove 's glorious child !
The weapons poised and darted and withdrew .
And tears are shed .
Their faith and love to manifest ,
Transfus 'd on thee his ample spirit rests .
Again it feels the fatal weight below ,
Hope lay nestling at her heart ,
Affection sound , and human passions quell .
And meet its changes as they come ,
Cools my heart with blissful tears .
Those beautiful eyes still follow me .
All his the heart no sorrow bends ,
O monarch , in thy son we find .
Nor track the home with grim affairs ;
Nor loosed his grip until the life was gone .
Daily round its flowers the wild bees flew .
They leave us so to the way we took ,
Jack knows what brings gain or loss ;
You and i have found the joy had birth
And weave , and task thy maidens . war belongs
Will never give us cause for shame ,
Earth calls up courage to her mighty heart ,
What joy sufficient hath november felt ,
The twilight hath stole over it , and made
Nor made her sacred to the shades below .
And he spoke the words which follow :
When terror swept the living from the dead , --
Each day his soul went up in prayer
In him the daily traits were viewed
The sword of gideon , and of god descends .
The ring the false enchantment served to clear .
West india dock may some time suffer a drought ;
Your conscience , making cursed all the day .
But as in peace we tread love 's land ,
A century after this 't was lost ,
Or only a sorrow left over from life ,
What sums from these old spouses i could raise ,
Straight to the mayor he took his way :
An old romance to make young lovers weep .
As heaven had spent all perfumes there .
His banner and shield shall bear .
The foaming coursers to the stalls they led ;
On tuesday an address was presented ;
The ms. adds this couplet :
Now trebly thundering swelled the gale
Beseems the wrath that wrongs the vow ,
The tears i shed must ever fall ,
And then a pensive sigh he drew ,
Make havoc of our life and powers ,
And soon the breath of morning came and fanned
And heal with freedom what your slavery cursed .
That stirs in every heart i see
He wept to find the course he ran --
That steadfast , mournful strain , consoled
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss ;
There lies not any troublous thing before ,
The waters wild went o'er his child ,
He tried to take a throw ;
To thee i make my prayer .
A smell of cooking filled a gust of smoke .
All gave consent , and forth there rose no lack
His presence makes us happy ,
So passed in making up the main account :
The billows fierce that tossed to and fro ,
The shorter days were slowly coming round ,
To see what my black hen doth lay .
And , trembling , these submissive words return ’d :
In skill , the worm a lesson may impart ;
Anthology is known to have been made .
Here cased in ice , the apricot ,
Nor only bring them tidings hame ,
I armed with all the fires of fate ,
All our hopes and fears were centered
And nothing with him stayed .
And raise his base on that one solid joy ,
Winter is worn that was the flowers ' bale .
She quakes and fears to meet his sight ;
Much more than i relate between us pass 'd :
To fill the swelling veins for thee , and now
Of our two lives together , joining them ;
Beneath its roots i often thought treasure was buried :
Smiles coming seldom , but childlike and simple ,
Till the name of frost was given
Against a coast where sapphire shattered white ,
Inscrutably take that light whereon they look --
That sing to seas of light .
But fear seized not idomeneus as fear
Is the hour not fix 'd by fate ?
And if it were i have the truth expressed .
Though placed by wayward fortune here .
Who shall pierce to thy naked splendour ,
The lake becoming that still bears her name .
And bless the friendly hand that gives me bread .
Following from world to world intent i seek . "
I shall make beauty out of many things :
The magic plant thy curious hand invades ;
What do we bring in these hearts of ours ?
That locks love 's captive in ,
And on soft smelling flowers laid him downe ,
When no force else can get the masterdom .
Ill luck still haunts a fairy grot .
Joy , and a little sorrow shalt not give ?
Than poets ever dreamt of yore ;
Like the caged bird escaping suddenly ,
For virtue gets a high reward ,
Each time to find new chances he has missed ?
" descending hence unto the lowest powers ,
When on commanding love the blame is thrown .
My part in her is doubled . "
Let yourself feel ; and shadeful trees ,
Upon th ' immortal gods to vent his rage .
And the wretched council 's bosoms beat ,
He took counsel with his dam ,
All other beasts that saw , with like desire
His hand the wise creator stayed ;
These i withdrew from him , and made his days
Everywhere night lies like a blue cloth .
No wonder disease should have swelled up her liver ,
The hay-sweet heat that soaked the skies !
Hunted from the arrogant equality of the rest ;
That will get him out of the way .
To mark each passing age .
To stay the foemen passing by
Within his arms encircled and sustained me ,
None shall stand in the way of the lord ,
Simply obedient to its guiding will ,
And all life 's warmth to stony coldness turned .
That parson puts to sleep .
As the dancers swing in a waltz of strauss ;
You hit , exactly , new year 's day ,
We 'll try to find some brighter side .
The beauties it reveals through love .
No patriot voice thy glory shall recall ,
Answered in the words that follow :
Cool airs are murmuring that the night is near .
My heart runs o'er with sweet surmises ,
But the night shall be filled with nightmares ,
Such guerdon as fell to their lot .
Law can discover sin , but not remove ,
Love not , it may bring the sorrow ,
He laughed , and something glad within me sank .
Facing the silence -- facing the prospect
From the white part come the moonbeams ,
That grieved and doubted , it came to pass
By bitter waters , mixed by those who feigned
But as lamenting will not raise the dead ,
One gem to name as most supremely fair ,
Whom late the nation he had led ,
And close inspection will show how tattered
They never grieve at all for sands that run ,
And slowly fading , ebbs the life away .
His presence doubled all admetus ' bliss ,
Malignant fate sat by and smiled --
To hold their fête champêtre .
So christian warriors own the sin of strife , --
Or all enjoying , what contentment find ?
Seeks the whole church to overthrow !
Then just to get a rap from burke ,
Whence scholars , statesmen , bards have sprung ,
The question ran , was arthur mold
And many deaths do they escape by this :
Peace that knows not crime nor sin .
For few the horses which that region bore ;
Who pile with foliage the great hills , and rear
To scrape acquaintance with his lands ;
Why , even death stands still ,
All hearts are touched and softened at her name ,
Cold , cold , this heart must grow ,
Who journey thither find themselves alone
Make slow pursuit , or altogether balk
Grievous sufferings came upon her ,
Supine on earth an awful figure lies ,
And left us nothing to believe in , worth
Love is enough : ho ye who seek saving ,
The north , came riding on the wind ,
In worship man hath lost ;
The years that through my portals come and go .
That night the wind blew from the north ,
I took her dainty eyes as well .
But no -- earth still demands her smile ;
' t is he that gives us value .
Now has lost its hundred branches ,
Till the sun and moon changed places ,
Out of your rhymes and rip your dream .
And a sound of music passing sweet
I know not , and its lucid orb concealed .
' a power which comes and goes like dream ,
As when it nursed the blossoms of our spring .
And the salt sea it came in .
And each from each takes heart of grace
Nought but griefs with me remain .
Thither the vanquisht hafed led
Which gives their daily bread .
By its own light the truth is seen ,
There came a sudden glimpse of spirit faces ,
_ extremes are fatal where they once do strike ,
Hath fashioned for a solace to itself ,
A settled calm , that brings relief ,
Which doubles what they think of the transgression :
Who enters here but finds the way more long
May a speedy reform more happy days bring .
She took the pity from my heart ,
Call all the loves to flutter nigh ;
On the seven sages turned their eager gaze , --
He set his face to the stream below ,
Disease is sin , the book defined ;
Daring all the herd to follow .
Entering a temple of his sire that stood
The freedom i now take of asking .
Except the straggling green which hides the wood .
And the boughs held twenty-one ;
And beautiful had sunk into the grave ,
Still more in one by promise bound .
Ceased the birds , the wind loud answer made ,
That sea which floweth forth with fixed tides ,
They have faded away where the last dreams die ...
A bell was calling folk to prayer :
With earnest supplication pressed ,
Our lives went on together until now .
There the sure suns of these pale shadows move ;
He did not know the inquisition stood ,
Beyond the sob that stilled erinna 's voice .
Begone , and give me peace ,
To make the matter fully known all round .
Beneath whose light the shadow loses form .
I felt my soul within me reel and sway
Which showed that he did n't care one rap
The flowers suggest the cricket season !
When they gave their foes the rout ,
Over my mood stealing and spreading they come ,
That same sweet rumour flows ,
The snow was falling , as if heaven dropped down
And poured forth what their spirits felt ,
And tumbling in the troubled stream took keep
And as it falls awakens leafy tunes :
Boldly and wild his music finds its star .
Among the opening clouds shall shine ,
And dark through paths oblique their progress take .
Now , foiled and shattered , it rose again
What came of her ? the bitter nights
That wakes time 's sleep thereunder
Death comes in a day or two .
What marriage means , thus pert replied :
In a wide world rimmed with blue
Ye blow upon the sod that wraps my friend :
And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance .
As quick a growth to meet decay ,
Jack knows what brings gain or loss ;
Life is composed of them ; and it seems wisdom
Our loves as flowers fall to dust ;
The breezes sadly blow .
That first spoke peace to man .
Another said , while heaving sighs ,
Of heaven go spinning its own wilful way .
Glimpses i caught of faces that have come
But darkly closed the war around ,
Raised in defiance , daisy fraser stood .
On desperat revenge , that shall redound
Ships move , running or beating , and the poise
Thus all things lovingly went on ,
Golden , set with red , the blossoms glowing ;
" i wish that ye may sink for sin "
Whose judgment can discern , whose choice approve .
He points his guns , his colors fly ,
It shows but cowardice
On these bleak climes by fortune thrown ,
Giving his benediction and embrace ,
And ancient valour turns to cowardice .
And gleam by following gleam is spurred and driven .
And answer with reluctant tread :
The mighty pile of freedom rose .
For thee their snares the suitor lords shall lay
Shouldst thou it require of them
They 'll bear the burden of their guilt ,
Sit silent , while our days have sped away
Without regard , or due decorum kept ;
From which all heavenly virtues shoot .
Robbed by a tyrant 's iron sway ,
Into his soul , and gave him power to cope
To that man my faith is given ,
Save to wait for the sign to come :
That would be perfect , made his mind .
Awakes to grief the soften 'd mind ,
Iran , his dear-loved country , made
Here warlike latins hold the happy lands .
And dying to destruction go .
And those sunk eyes now lost to earth
The different doom our fates assign .
My soul with the deep shadows round thee drawn ,
How all his malice served but to bring forth
Reserved for wealthy men ,
Cold winter 's ice is fled and gone ,
Trusted the man , made surety doubly sure ,
Naught meets you there but the childlike , truthful ,
The trodden throne restored -- the saxon line
They pulled and hauled and orders gave ,
Is set with such a witching art ,
To take th ' initiative of ruthless war ;
And poured his wasting moments out in tears .
Which crept into each _ reverend _ sire ,
Enormous arches , give beholders ; --
And every sail its various tribute pays :
It made you wish that you might only live
Their eyes shall see the kingdom of the law ,
But when sir thomas went to his devotions ,
We here appeal to thy superior throne :
But wait till they burst into warm white snow !
It takes its proper place -- a masterpiece !
When the rain descends , decay decays it :
And the dew lay on the flowers ,
And make it public law , to burn ,
And through the dawning irids ambushed meanings show .
Always makes her wish to pray ;
She saw the tears his speech that broke ,
She went to fill 'd my soul with dread .
Seeing how fair she was . her sweet voice rang
For cast he but his eye toward the plain
That he who seeks her beauty 's furthest goal ,
Then first the hero ’s manly breast knew fear .
Whose sweet pure touch just waved the trees .
That moved me unto love , and such an one
Perversions and inventions heaped thereon .
He bore the wounds of woe :
Always aspiring to be set in tune
The red gate-towers rise against the twilight ,
Night and day have made an everlasting bond
Of forest , hung and carpeted with glooms ,
And heaps of bodies raise the level ground .
In their depths the passion lies
The pilgrim in its halls found rest .
Peace would go out forevermore
Or any strong emotion linked with clay .
The giddy swallows take to flight ,
Knowing the soil that stuck , so well ,
But the singer sits with his grief alone
With solemn echoing stirs their dwelling-place .
The white leaves flutter , one by one ,
But when winter months come ,
The trees their rain of blossoms shed
Then we shall go to sleep ,
While rising from the rapid beat
Then dwindled like her blossom ; june was breaking .
The heart will seek its kindred heart ,
The wonder that my wit can not indite .
Death warm as life . ” then rose a cry
Great good treasure his knights have placed in pound ,
Goes to the feast that 's now provided .
The love you brought , oh , baby dear ,
Right may be found or wrong . my latest prayer
The lightning flashed from cloud to cloud ,
His body , on whose eyes minerva pour 'd
And error held with steadfast mind aloof .
To feel the frosty air , inform the day ;
And sorrow 's piercing dart .
Such odorous tribute gave the magdalene ;
But the cruel rocks they gored her sides
Nor felt a magnet 's sly seduction .
Mothers , they leave us , quickening seed ;
And frozen pearls are all the world can show ,
Time will come to part , love ,
And the fierce pain clutched me and held me ;
Her feet disperse the powdery snow ,
That blocks the artery .
To catch thy gaze , and uttering graceful words
That puts eternal sadness on his brow ,
Of earthly ministers , tho ' their mouths be stuffed
But yesterweek where the cloud waves rolled
E'er find too fond an ear ;
Gave me to face the orient . nor our way
But when the fever leaves him and he feels
The white lake-blossom fell into the lake ,
Or stem the tide heaven pushes through our veins ,
Like the wee blink that shines in a tear .
Nor fit the time to send whole armies out ,
Foretold so lately what would come to pass ,
Put forth thy strength , and release ;
And she for them in heaven makes intercession .
That can all crosses blessings make ;
Not one but that its memory makes him glad .
The warfare , now , th ' invaders make
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell ,
The volleying thunder there laid low ;
He met with his hurt where a regiment fell ,
So has another paradise been lost .
And the target , bathed in blood ,
This night are held with poignant gust ,
There to shape them into weapons ,
As it roared along the forest ,
My southern friend had got no brain .
The article exhibits the following forms :
On thee we cast each earthborn care ,
My soul forgot all eyes but them , --
Her nervous hands in gestures half controlled .
And sweet from where the land lies green ;
Precedence slowly claiming and so slowly fixing firm .
She bore sarpedon of heroic note .
Drips the spring my boyhood knew .
That shaped her sorrow , rocks and pools ,
A world of fixed remembrances
The bowl goes trim . the moon doth shine .
His flames from burning but to blow them more :
This stone can tell the story of my life ,
He therefore turns , the poet wary ,
That was the greatest picture on any canvas wrought ;
And such fair truce replaced that discord fell ,
Warm presence of chaste beauty , had resolved
The radiant moon above us held :
Then to automedon he gave command
And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street .
That topmast-high the flashing waters flew .
All it dreamed when it stood
With this wild rose that all may share ? _
The armies fade , the lustre dies .
The silent joy that sinks so deep ,
Contending in the games held at his tomb ,
To keep me happy all the day .
And to their imperial manhood rise the ashes from
Beneath thy blue canopy i have found shelter ,
And made her think of elfin lamps ,
Soft wafted dark curls from pale temples --
' for here , forlorn and lost i tread ,
How all our copper had gone for his service !
Than any broken music thou canst make . '
He that sends the cruel winter ,
The lines of sorrow that lie drawn in me
If , chance , by lonely contemplation led ,
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
And as the azure stream has found
Her heart shall taste my laughter and my tears ,
Love has found itself the whole .
In every clime while army army meets ,
All that which afrike ever brought forth strange ,
Too blindly have reposed my trust :
The trojan fire still burns : pledge of the past
The river slips through its silent bed .
Of the great shield , wherein the lion lies
For all my wounds are moving in my breast ,
In coward gloom immersed , or fell despair .
To move for very joy all hearts to tears
This goblet , wrought with curious art ,
The health of a day gone by , --
If one should feel consoling arms about ,
They go in whirls of light
That oft has made poor children weep ,
Round farmers ' chariot fall the slain ,
And hope and memory made a mingled joy .
Such suns in such a bed deserve to sink .
Her eyes were filled with sudden strange alarms ;
Our lakes and streams hold wealth untold ,
Some tears of misery she shed .
To leave the terror sterner for the light .
Could make that strange enchantment live again ?
Then went , while earth on winter glared aghast ,
But boundless oceans , roaring wide ,
To-day , base warrior , shall thou feel
The soul disdainful seeks the caves of night ,
And every sparkle shivering to new blaze ,
Since your bright leaves first saw the sun ,
Whence fell the tearful gleam that then
{ 59 } objections stated and met .
Which daśaratha kept in view .
The solid gate its fury scarcely bounds ;
Shall find his avarice there and cowardice ;
To that which never can us comfort bring .
How many days have been idly spent ;
With my young heart filled with terror ;
A face that lifted up ; sweet face
Our faith and patience ; wherefore should we leap
Showing as darkness deepened more and more
Horrid to think , how horrible to feel !
The venom of their hate is spent ;
Some through the grey air darting in swift flight .
Et corporis sedes in secret was placed .
Not art but nature traced these lovely lines ,
Where the great wall round china goes ,
Longer , for remedy can none be found ;
It made an awful racket ! "
Love makes his sign , and by no other road
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore ,
Of infamy ! fierce conflict hath arisen ;
Christ 's precious gift of wisdom glowed .
From which some trivial perquisites arise ,
Why , even death stands still ,
But to an end it came , all right ,
How urchins , searching at day 's decline
" a scrap of paper holds for man and wife
Holiest memories with it remain .
To find the precious morning hours were lost .
Came the spring , and all the forest
And set to work millions of spinning worms ,
And here the poet meets his favoring muse .
Ah , quick her tears are springing ,
Which serve at once for music and for snuff ,
Would change their element , and their chill streams
Some saw a dragon eating up the light ,
Set his face to the darkness , and fled .
His woodland pastures left , he sought the stream ,
Thus in your books the record shall be found ,
True love , long sought and found at last ,
Shall found a commonwealth .
Where waters ' neath the waters run ,
The look of grasses thrusting through the earth ,
Such light as the music loves ,
Gives a hint of the wonderful life without ;
To keep my heart fit for his holy sight ,
" kalevatar took the splinter
Approach his chariot , and his knees embrace ,
To see if magic fins would rise :
To fool the world with false appearances .
And true love waits for you ;
Now occupy my heart .
For talking age and whispering lovers made .
Each star of meaner merit fades away !
Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold .
A selfish inclination firmly fought ,
Love makes all wisdom seem but poorest folly ,
That heaven on him above this charge had laid ,
Than human passions please . in every heart
Each separate coloured ray . he let it strike
Peace from this reeking sword , low let him lay
And then she paused a little and went on :
Ask god who knows . for frequent tears have run
And give them battle ! how my heart leaps up
She who sparkles while she feels ?
To mend his barn , cut baucis down ;
His shining horns diffused a golden gleam ;
And eyes that wake to weep ;
In little groups from that sad concourse broke ,
A shadow which the onward soul behind throws :
They canna sit for anger ,
Thy soul shall find itself alone
Dark fell ere they might set their eager feet
This sometimes gryphon takes , and whirled through air ,
And they , her smiles of love caressed ,
Of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves ,
Of living valor , rolling on the foe ,
Some dream within whose heart lives no disdain
The charms of wedlock all his soul employ :
There came a mournful ho , ho .
Take either part , sure ills attend the choice ;
A schedule of his means he briefly drew ,
This shore received them wandering o'er the sea .
Which sprinkles benediction through the dawn ;
There another crowd streamed onward .
" plague take the printer and his debt :
His late delight , no more his care engage ;
The flower which bethlehem saw bloom
Sickness may depart , and time restore him , --
Never was philter formed with such power
His jaws uplifting from their fell repast ,
The regions of unfading peace ye see ,
That took me hence ) and with that memory
When crossing public sentiment means fight .
As any muse 's tongue could speak ,
It scratched their eyes and made them blind ,
Behind me lies naught but grief and misery ;
Cast her line and caught a man ,
The value , the delight that in thee lies ;
Have spread their boughs and verdant foliage ,
And freedom walks abroad --
That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart ;
Lost with a grief beyond the saltest tear ,
Some mischief settled in its fleshy part .
He sitteth there in silence , worn and wasted
And firm the gracious promise thou hast made ! "
Though joy 's right hard to discover ,
In comes the playmate that never was seen .
To meet the foe in forefront of the fight .
A sum that keeps them from despair ;
Beneath his conduct sought the phrygian shores .
Nothing that moves to fill the vision aching ,
The parapet was reached .
Give warning to the world , that i am fled
Are for the church 's peace to rest retired ;
And in sweet singing would the evening spend .
" some compensation find , that the time pass not
But when the pleasant summer comes ,
What wealth historic might your words impart !
Now at last i have managed to move house .
And the fig and the sycamore gathered green ,
" descending hence unto the lowest powers ,
Slayer of madhu ! further , make me know
The delicate shells lay on the shore ;
A greater shadow moved : and in this shadow
The fate of a nation was riding that night ;
Where life runs on at such a petty pace ;
It makes us wander ; wander earth around ,
With drifting perfume , that belongs
Shall , in the vengeance it dispenseth , find
For youth goes over , the joys that fly ,
Even thy memory recedes into forgetting ,
But who recalls the tears she shed ,
Keep their old peace , and show our wars .
Take heart of grace ,
Relates her case , and will conclude the fray
The flowers must lie buried in darkness
On every conscience ; laws which none shall finde
With their fists they burst asunder
Cloud and wind may shift and veer :
A fortitude that scorns to crawl .
May fill these fields by fast belief ,
That upon my pulses wrought :
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
If the dark face of slavery on you turns ,
To howl and chafe amid the bending trees ,
When fated hands lay garlands on its base .
He but to end their strife and quarrel sought .
A womb that yearns for birth ,
The present consumes all the time they can spare .
That all my sense in ravishment was lost .
Still north , until he met a stretching wall
Has planted quiet in the night ;
Becomes not poison that doth burn and cling ;
Gives added fragrance to the summer flowers ,
And the moon stands still and listens
Lightning appeareth if the road it cross ;
And proselytes to crush autocracy .
Where proud ambition seldom dwells ;
And to industry is inclined .
It shrank with pain or fear :
If such unhappy days should come ,
And the travail of her that bore ,
Every incident which arose in the progress of the controversy
Love moves her with his golden sway --
The way life goes in the world above ,
Darkness of age has settled on your face :
And overwhelm their war : the race elect
The waters creep with fear ;
A soul has gone .
" he shakes his serpent tongue that lies ,
I fear we 'll come to harm . "
When silvery locks no more around his temples play ,
That lies forever in the light ;
And her thoughts ran on as follow :
For fear the path should lead astray
A warmer heart than clay can hold ?
Another story on the rock imposed ;
The dona had mingled her weeping ,
Peace will descend on us , discord will cease ;
Yet all that is broken shall be mended ,
A little while a little space made bright .
Expert to edge anew the arms of faith ,
In these years ! yet , i feel ,
An easy compensation seem to find .
Almost since man from paradise was driven ;
To ease the hardships of the labouring poor ;
To find i loved her all the more !
Make an end of thy deception ,
For many a laugh went through the vale ;
The little fate bestows they share as soon ;
" if she be made of white
One only prayer i dare to make ,
The rest is as the winds that blow .
The blended sweets to feed th ' immortal sense .
Pierced by a flemish musket-ball ,
That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect
And drew up each soul from its grave .
Eternal truth proclaim ;
Jealousy , upon this , took up the play ,
Althaea ’s hate the unhappy warrior drew ,
Sorrow he banish 'd from his place of rest ,
Our genial craft , together quaffed
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes .
Then it makes a star !
Was with such nervous tension strung ,
` he hath followed a ghost in flight .
Pay the deep reverence , taught of old ,
Soul , take thine ease , let sorrow cease ,
To make her heart 's delighted glorying
Who curse the hand that gives you bread ,
Winged on a flight she could not follow ,
They partly know , and are made glad thereby .
Nor oars to cut the immeasurable way .
To tumult every bosom wrought .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Some word to make thy memory gentle there ; --
He covers with joy his sad heart .
Had wrought your sorrows in the days
And none may with my bliss compete . ”
Through me you pass into eternal pain :
And manly thoughts inspired by manly age ,
But follow god , be meek and wise ;
The age comes on , that future age of gold
That this sorrow may escape thee ,
That paves kings ' palaces , to feel
To drive by thrust of spear that terrible host
His soul in that sweet hour was lost .
Reserving , human left from human free .
To sanctify the nature , -- these things make
Finding how trivial the myriad things
Disdain just wrinkles baby youth ;
Nor serves a verbal penance , but with haste
It springs from truth alone , the truth we live
Of the great curse , which glares in every beam
A lamp to guide me through the darkness ; and
His fixed decree can change or shun .
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn 'd .
And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight !
To waste the loveliness that time could spare ,
Au odor volcanic , that rather mends it ,
As though death 's veil already had been cast
Then soon from town and city numbers came ,
You and i have found our lips can meet .
And clattering and battering and shattering ;
A welcome they threw to the pilgrim ,
The spring had waned from wood and wold
Was with you in the temple , ye stretched forth
A fountain 's there which never will run dry :
Her caged heart cried and stirred .
The ghastly dun shall worry his sleep ,
Nor spend its hours in idleness or play .
The noted sea shall change his name with me ,
Not by such grief as this are moved
They went up to their desire ,
There beneath the dewy hillside sleep the noblest
Recalls the deadly obloquy he forged
We lift our eyes to heaven and say :
We shall take them as lightly as girls
Can shed o'er nature 's charms till now .
Baby , too , must go to sleep !
To lay out fortune 's gifts ; and niccolo
The damsel ’s breast with fury burned :
To house the profit that arrives ;
Of suff ' ring gives me patience .
And bring the tidings in .
Who make poor claims upon thee , perfect lord ;
It played inaudible melodies ,
A wildwood blossom lay ,
A dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased .
Then , as his lips with fury swelled ,
Her lips can whisper the tenderest words
And wits take lodgings in the sound of bow ;
When buried lay her whiter brows ,
Wine that turns to song our sorrows ;
Happy are these who lose imagination :
The valley holds its feast of roses ;
Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark ,
" thereupon the bird made answer ,
But , though it answers as a puff ,
At this last hour , the church may yet withhold
After the hour has struck , to close again .
Under stagnant roofs that frown .
And found them feasting , and all things the same
To waken the sorrow that should have died ,
The sun that visits their grave so lightly ;
Its loss and loneliness , and went my way .
Of leafless trees and drifting snows ,
The stage that twixt you lay .
There in her fatal beauty lay the queen
To fix upon his face her pitying eyes .
Except of sighs , that made th ' eternal air
On which king charles his yoke had nearly laid .
The locust played on his musical wing ,
Before us here the bread of life is spread ,
Whose faint escaping break along dim aisles ,
These to their softened hearts should bear
The new years come , the old years go ,
Of these the greater portion served to guide
Told what reward he hoped should quit his pain ,
I blinded its eyes , and it became hatred --
Let me feel your breathing
Hence , his warm lay with softest sweetness flows !
For in it naught but love i see ,
Where the first napoleon lay
Quicker than thought its dire resolves are made ,
Of a love that loved too well ?
In lonely rooms , secured from public sight ;
That those were blossoms which he took for snows .
The jury signed the verdict and arose
First there came a gentle wind blowing ;
To show with what complacency he creeps ,
In wine he makes my senses swim ,
Beneath the rest it lay divinely bright ,
With his bloody crest erected ,
Leading to universal knowledge -- see ,
Little brown baby of mine , go to rest .
And might find a peaceful dwelling .
Where in childhood , oft we strayed ;
And there arose from the depths of my spirit
Their hurrying wings the shelter seek ;
May bring to the lone heart relief ?
No sin his stainless name can dim ;
Since it was made it had known change .
And words fell soft as willow-buds ,
He made use of as a carpet
Facing the silence -- facing the prospect
Till at his second bidding darkness fled ,
The liquor spent , they to dancing went ,
What wrongs are borne , what deeds are done
Through their blood , and binds their souls ,
In many an orbit wheels , then lighting sits
And give the greeks to visit greece again .
The voices of men and women left it lonely .
Then the good lord touched certain fervid hearts ,
There sat the powers in awful synod placed ;
Past they go with their measured tread ,
Assail it , but those talons hold in dread ,
Love took my life and thrilled it
The realms of sweet perdition lay ,
Sorrow always brings .
As turned her sweet eyes to the light ,
And thus you see it strangely came
The eagles floated , struggling with the wind .
So much of sunshine with him that i caught ,
We make delay , that somewhat first the sense ,
And rising flame of spirit , giving light ,
They plunged again into the wondrous torrent ,
The hours unfolding slow to twilight gray ,
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses ?
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;
That life might perish out of arcady
My soul has left its tent of clay
Received since they were led salvation to embrace .
Quick went my breath and quick my heart ,
Will man find hope on yonder coast ?
That spread its shade on every side .
Calm , wedded affection , that home-rooted plant
Which gives out flame , yet it its whiteness shines
But what he took a glance ,
The gummy shroud that wraps her embryo leaves ;
Might to right the statue gave ;
And his editions -- such fame has he gained --
But can not bite , howling their accusations
Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love ;
The palm usurp 'd without a victory ,
How to the circle fitted , and therein
Of her who kept the tryst ;
There spread a lurid gleam
Hartford 's the place we reach next ;
Where the hills ' green shadows sleep
That only serves to make us grieve ,
Its fugitive the church he gave ,
And thankful that our harvests wear no taint
Hearts that with rising morn arise !
But the brooding fog lay soft as down
Nor vineyards waiting , nor reproachful thorn ,
Both in one being to embrace with bliss .
His voice was all the pup could lift ,
And my heart owns a doubt
Their banners shake , their bearers shrink , for ill
Long centuries have come and gone ,
Wherefore i turned me to my counsel sage .
Like shadows grown substantial .
The trees have put on a thin green pretense .
For slow and slow that ship will go ,
Who follow gods go to their gods ; who vow
Their heart is too proud into nothing to melt ,
And from the gods and sages pealed
The counter-cry goes past --
To seize thy life shall lurk the murderous band ,
The phantom armies marching go !
The great excitement i had lately shown .
The royal herald to his vessel led .
The day and the hour have come .
In heart sore troubled at the story shown ;
And of their ancient quarrel make an end .
Then a heavy sigh arose ,
His mercy fills the khyber hills --
And by the bank their steps were led
Where the widow give the party .
It shall make room for me ;
My heart leaps with a great gust of joy .
Removing filth , or sinking it from sight ,
Which precipice smiled tempting death ... "
She leaves them all for love of him .
Then shake them in despair , and dance again .
With small soft hands that once did keep in tune
Some follow science , some cleave to art ,
He drove forthwith a splendid stroke ;
The football matches an ' the picter shows .
Whom maháśaila ’s caverns hold :
There came into many a burgher 's pate
Hissed and quivered but held no light .
The trembler goes , a victim-bride ;
Thine is redemption ; they just gave the key :
And each swift moment fled , is death advanced
And often found life 's hopes to stand
There be among the saints some who have held
It quieted pain and sorrow ,
Kill us with pity , break us with ourselves --
Clothed with spring or sunk in polar winters
She clutched this sleeve to stay my flight ,
The badger grins and never leaves his hold .
May have diverted from continual watch
We catch up wild at parting saints
That make the humble toiler 's story .
And all the trembling spheres confessed the god .
Of the moon among them flitting ,
Her wounded hull , shrouds shot away ,
The tearful gleam , that trembles there ,
That round them in the sun lay sighing
Across the meadows laced with threaded dew ,
And tears and kisses soon explain 'd the rest .
" on argument alone my faith is built : "
By trial taught your pain :
Sure divine beauty in this dame does shine ?
Which waved at waterloo ,
Till our new england shall unlock the gate .
The great winds taught them song .
The writing traced upon the desert 's sand ,
Illusions that shed brightness over life ,
To raise through darkness the banner of light !
Such distress should overwhelm me ,
The source of the disease that nature feels ,
Like a bright banner woven by the sun .
Dismiss ’d with fame , the favoured youth withdrew .
For fear i 'll break through the ice !
And froze the genial current of the soul .
As men set tubs to catch the rain ,
At last one little clause he found
In th ' same piece find scatter 'd philosophy
Like the wee blink that shines in a tear .
He brings by falsifying of the coin ,
And makes fine-drawn lines with its point .
And in the eye of pleasure melt .
And figured in her death . my dearest friend ,
For satan , with sly preface to return ,
To grasp the accident of bitterness .
For she felt all the reverence death made due ,
Broke but the bond of love which nature makes .
Forever fixed on high .
Brought back the lost wild roses of her youth
There he descended from his monster 's side ,
Let this great war no longer now endure . "
Away they spring . the rustling stubbles bend
Under some star that bit the brazen sky ,
Like hues of dawn , which fly too soon ;
Some heavenly gleam had cast ;
The snail draws in his head ;
That climbs through darkness up to light , --
She let the winds blow back her hair
Till a silence fell with the waking bird ,
Where now the vital energy that moved ,
And listen 'd to her breathing , if it chanced
Liburnian galleys follow . over all
And seek the magic that can give
My sorrow shall make thee its god , and set
Glad letters came from helen ; happy things ,
Their feasting o'er , now enter sorrow !
But law allows thee , if thou wilt ,
Pale sorrow on my spirit falls ,
To spend his life on ocean wave .
That heart that lo'ed me dearly !
Whither lies your royal way ,
From many a tender breast drew many a groan .
No voice like thine to breathe the song ;
And his heart was filled with awe .
Turn to his dungeon 's suffocating night ?
One nearer kindred than life hinted of .
The mad fates took the rest .
And then went on , ' moreover thou shalt say
That ruled thy simple maiden band .
Her marble wrought , her music breathed ;
And he spoke the words which follow :
Of life 's kind purposes pursued
Or settling , seize the sweets the blossoms yield ,
And still the world goes round . "
The leaves lie thick upon the way
Nor fell the blaze upon the ships alone ,
Nor can i their truth admit .
Shall you search for new adventures ;
All nature struggling in the pangs of death !
When sunrise flashed , when sunset flared ,
Let no man rule who holds his money dear .
Two lofty thrones commanded land and main .
That shines above the garden trees ,
Thy message to the king i bore .
Tend the game of thy dominions .
Comes like the tragic burden of a song .
To certain hints ned gave the czar --
Up came the felon crew .
The wanderer breathed his last .
The lowliest duties on herself did lay .
His holy rule of action heard ;
I 'll go beyond the letter : --
Than stair of throne can lead ,
Where hollyhocks stand tall .
Of golden hair , to wild assaults invited .
One ray of saddest comfort she may see , --
Not in despair , to have found themselves not lost
He loosed a carrier pigeon , having tied
Eager lips , and mighty straining at the cords !
Of ruffled kisses heaven itself had tied .
Catch at deception 's airy gossamers ,
This misery on my soul has brought ,
The truth , in which all intellect finds rest .
A bracelet spun from mountain mist ,
( as light airs stir a sleeping lake )
With him whom fortune sends to thee . ”
Turpin de reins arises from the ranks
And must pass my life in mourning ,
A raging cloud that runs before the wind ;
Which venus tunes , and all her loves inspire ;
Like the blood-red light that swims on
Men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire .
And casting a truly delicious perfume
Dew-fresh was all the wavering air .
And depart in peace ; this prayer i make ,
I tender free to scotland 's laws .
The sleepy time-boy 's feet passed overhead .
Thus shall mankind his guardian care engage ,
The breast a double terror feels .
Of labour ? for all i may devise or find
The ducks prepared themselves to learn
Blows off the filth that hid the deeper sky ;
No longer treads the guilt-polluted world ,
Raise into godness , set above the strife
The registry and label rested safe ;
And where the bare trunks stood
That thrills the grasses , stirs the trees .
Formed to delight at once and lash the age :
It follows willingly and builds for them
And made the forests and the groves rebound
In sight , then lost amidst the forestry
Ten days th ' eternal doors displayed
And dreadful act , who took within the toils
As do their speeches and distempers show .
And thence the foreign radiance is reflected ,
For coming conflicts . " they obey his words
Bright as it now lay dark .
Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
Of hazy cloudlets , swept her graceful way ,
Where your hands can never reach them .
And silence , unbroken , reigned awfully round : --
Of steps had worn a way . not verdant there
And trembling struck , and rooted in the field ;
Now slowly comes a towering wave ,
Or heard the song , save god .
And thou , sweet beauty , brightly flashing ,
By moderation either state to bear ,
So he went forth to battle , on the side
And crystal springs shall drop thee melody .
Sordidly shifting hands with shades and night .
The rigid interdiction , which resounds
The moons who drop their shattered petals here
The light reflected ever from those radiant skies .
But always one unchanging distance kept ,
Your strength , united , best may help to bear
A text which says , that heaven 's gate
Verses addressed to the author
For sorrows bearing fruit of nobler life ;
Shall make a clearer faith and manhood shine
Out of corruption comes the flower ,
“ quen thai war passed over _ strand _ ,
When autumn stands ' mid the dropping nuts ,
With sorrows bear it down .
In recent days , and called for power .
And then , that we have followed them
The christians cleaving them as they fled ,
When buried lay her whiter brows ,
She lent her magic from the world below ;
Just as leaves in autumn lay !
But night sits monarch yet in the mid sky .
The imperial selim held a feast
With nothing but blank sky and wounds that ache ,
Fast the tears of count roland ran ,
Trust thou the leaping love that runs
For so my mind foreshowed my coming ill .
Therefore it suits that even the soul 's dissolved ,
Sing as they tripped a lilting round
And sank his terror out of sight .
Give all men heart to be free . "
And heaven above smiles down on peace below .
Left where the flowers of truth fell to earth ;
For whom thy song makes april all the year !
Were softened by the warm light from the west --
No answer came from the dome of blue , nor
Melted the blindness from my sight ,
" were the world to christianity converted , "
Reaching heaven ; but , one by one ,
The sights and sounds of life began to please .
Passing that way his benediction give .
In individuals i always discover the whole .
And death , and time shall disappear , --
What best may for the present serve to hide
So that it seemed they dripped with moonlight ,
Virtue could see to do what virtue would
When once true lovers take their last farewell .
Here fled the greeks , the trojan youth pursue ,
What note of triumph can her clarion breathe ,
When god sorts out the weather and sends rain --
That as they galloped made the echoes roar ;
Where you think a mermaid lay .
Quivered , the skies revolved . a northerly breeze
His altar-place these many days gone past ?
Made merriment within that pleasant bower .
O pray it take them suddenly !
With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves ;
Beyond its narrow sphere , and finds its work ,
On the dance that they fearfully lead .
If falls win pity , and defeat renown ,
Love takes the taint of years ,
When snow lies on the hills ,
Whose white and gleaming wings beat on through space .
His hall so old was hung around
Through the house give glimmering light ;
Nor art thou match for such a foe .
The hapless lady made reply :
And bell , whose girth had come undone ,
Their hearts beat thanksgiving for all things , completely
Than left the plunder of our country ’s foes .
Even the stars have gone . we two alone !
Has held and preached and taught me to believe ;
And he to this not one objection made .
My heart of thoughts that made it ache ,
O lips that mine have grown into
All forests find a tongue . and so that grass
Like bulls who lead the lowing throng ,
He seth hire face of such colour ,
And all the pleasures which therein did stay ;
And yet while france stood doubting if to join ,
And stores for man and beast that inland pour .
I sought a strain not all unworthy thee ,
Dance on the hurricane , leap its waves ,
Her presence ; but the music died and gave
And warmth from memory borrow ,
Feasting all day , and till the sun declined ,
Where everything of weight unites together ,
As sunlight will expand a rose .
Chispa . as the old song says ,
That made their clothes and faces bright .
Since he was sure his mother would fall sick ,
Round me the billows of battle are pouring ,
But dora bore them meekly . then before
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking ;
Seemed filled with shadows from its darkening wings ---
Eyes that seemed to ask a question . " ]
Their petticoats there you see .
Hath breathed that awful beauty through her face :
My weak estate to stablish come thou art ,
He found her mourning for her lord .
A sacred laurel springing from my grave :
In time of war ' twill never lag ;
But so pretending love , he hoped to speed ,
On the faint wind floated the silky seeds
Than on those great names mantua bore ;
To view thy crimes : the citizens are gone .
Which black and threatening clouds accompany :
Wisdom , though fled far away .
Where westminster 's cathedral lifts
But his love stood there indeed !
That kissed the maiden all forlorn ,
But to clear away his shadow .
When thy merry step draws near .
And let still others take command .
The warm shower sings across the lake .
It gives men happiness , or leaves them ease .
They found their women had , for comforts lost ,
Who all respect to sacred honor paid .
Far off from those hills that shine with day ,
When human joy holds all in one rapt look ?
And reached the treasure set apart of old ,
With steps that made the earth to bend ,
And with more watchful care thy brother kept .
Of boundless power from boundless suffering wrung :
Let your heart speak , minnehaha ! "
There 's many a warrior laid ,
While love 's luxurious pulse beat high ,
Ring out the feud of rich and poor ,
And vows are asked and given , shadows rise
How reason dictated that men
And failed to follow in my youth .
My swords are tempered for every speech ,
He made his fourth attempt , with awful mien
The wind has blown them all away :
Of flickering clouds . " monsieur popain , i
And down at his feet his bow he cast .
It stant noght upon my fortune .
Man saw the seeds of something good
Whose wrath hung heavy o’er the trojan towers :
And then glad tears have filled her eyes
Let 's drink eternal friendship from this horn .
Chicago beats the yankees bad
Which nature 's vernal hand has spread ,
Not poured forth , though sprung from sad lament ,
Then she , regarding him long fixed , replied :
No arms may take in battle strife :
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth ,
From his shining feathers shed off the cold sun .
First came the primrose ,
The spirit hung towards him when she ceased ,
Night came down on johnson 's shanty
Now open war , now ambush closely laid ;
When sunrise flashed , when sunset flared ,
Touch 'd by the heroism of him they slew ,
To bring us back assurance in that faith ,
Can sweetly soothe , and not betray .
For him whom poverty can force aside
For i feel it is love ,
Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend ,
In lips the name that leaped from lead and flame
I heard cold words ; then came a swift eclipse
My mind dictated . moments rolled away --
Thus stung with appetite , with anguish torn ,
With rosy gestures that rejoice
This is the point i wish to make : --
But he drank the air as though it held
Some kill their love when they are young ,
My duty lies before me . lo ,
Danced music , splashing to the elfin sea ;
As a weak flower gets colour from the sun .
To execute the vengeance of its wrath .
Do n't take your troubles to bed .
And i who prophesy shall never see ?
And shifting meaning of man 's spiritual worth
Without the gossips stood astare
The sea-wood sought he .
Who marked by grief and pain a visage wore .
In the great candlestick . they spread the veils ,
To watch the world with a heart grown cold ,
The evil days have come , the poor
And loud applauses echo through the field .
Ring out the feud of rich and poor ,
Despair and sorrow waiting on thy breath --
Are these the trees that looked at you
Courage , if sorrow come , to bear it ,
And our kingdom lifted high above the years .
The traveller to a shelter , summon 'd him
The snowdrops that early come forth ;
He took a fond farewell and went away .
I bound to thee for any favour asked ! '
Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity ,
Here they lie , had realms and lands ,
Like a long sigh charged with a last farewell ;
Strenuous she strives to raise her form erect ,
Of war-trained chiefs , these words addressed :
'till all the demon makes his full descent
And he spoke the words which follow :
Less faith than theirs who follow abraham ,
And make my progress into ev'ry sphere .
And freedom gives their tongues uncanny wit ,
And shoots weird sparks along the runes , imprest
Shall grow mighty rulers of state .
To pass delay not , urged by blows behind ;
That winds between thin ugly dunes ,
Five hundred years have nearly passed away
And day and night scarce changed the mournful skies .
The night winds go .
A man 's soul crying , behold what worth
In praising one , whichever may be taken ,
Enough to show a strong perceptive thought
As thus his speech the bird renewed ;
In giving to the asking earth
The enchantress melted every heart ,
Unto the land where all lies dead and cold ,
Then a storm arose in fury ,
Out of that mist of years there came
Turn melody to harmony ,
And he only can give me rest !
Halfway into the next , which having reached ,
Thy kindred appellation comes , and who ,
Made the echo so faint and sweet ?
Do n't you growl , that wo n't help ,
Which hovered as dreams do , still above :
Beautiful fairies come from high to serve thee ;
The lyon sleeping lay in secret shade ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
That your spirit may find its peace .
To their hives their treasures bring :
We saw the vessel , shown with pride ;
The wind sighs through the sycamores .
Against his soul struck solemn notes of pain .
The snow fell hissing in the brine ,
Of power , he raised his haughty brow . although
And the great sun that wrought this happiness ,
A bitter load i bore :
't is love that makes the heavens shine
Words from the mirror softly pass
The two first champions towards paris go ,
The saw went tearing thru the oak
Oh , say , where goes your love ?
He met the eyes of lady elfinhart ,
There fell upon the ground with sighs ,
About her , and made merry with her shame ,
The mournful captive spreads her hands in vain ,
The mournful trees that in the garden stood
They made yon poet wistful for the star ;
A word came to me , wonderful and good ;
And the criminals they made ?
Music came down upon them , and spring returning ,
Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
His spirit sank and terror pressed
Filled all the world , he made reply :
Whilst all the house my passion reads ,
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread ,
In the light of one hour as it flies ,
With yellow flowers ; these stood a little space
And tarquin 's eye may read the mot afar ,
Roses followed in her train ,
But drove her half out of her wits .
Verse can not say how beautiful thou art ,
What joy was this that filled his heart anew ?
None save they but the souls which them contain .
There is a dish to hold the sea ,
And in their cabin lay the secret charts ,
One charm i 'd add to this divine array ;
The storm-swift iris on her errand sped .
Sounds that gentle thoughts inspire :
Thy husband , him to follow thou art bound ;
In dowerless poverty find my delight .
Eagerly made haste to follow .
Be found at last an heir
That winds in thee , a river broad ,
As if the ethereal fairy blood were seen ;
Nor yearning memory his rage withstood ;
Or that this day menalchas keeps a feast
That gave me public leave to speak of him :
That feebly burned in him the amorous flame .
The silver stream her virgin coldness keeps ,
Ye sons of fiction , clad in stupid prose ;
Let thy love pour its rainbow shower .
For swift as lightning came the thought to me ,
To soften all the field of fears ,
Just where they turned to silver , raleigh looked back
On which account our story made a halt ,
I was your husband when you rode the air ,
His knowledge of good lost , and evil got ,
Whether with loveliness revealed complete ,
Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew ,
Of holy spirit , which has been diffused
A while these nights and days will burn
While all the flames of dream expire .
" unhappy man ! to wasting woes a prey ,
Restraining , calm he suffer 'd the affront .
As have seen service in the truth , and bore
" and wisdom comes by looking eye to eye ,
Love shows in light more bright than morn
The fault which lies direct from any sin
Share of truth was vainly set
Blind gods that can not spare .
In which it shines its soul away ;
For well they now can spare their wings ,
Till , where he meant to carve his motto ,
For , though life may pass away ,
They seem to be breathing a burden of woe ;
Upon the skies a veiling shadow lies .
All the winter lay .
The hen would have pranked up her feathers ,
But could not find his lost heart anywhere .
And at every drifting cloud that went
And a new moon rode overhead .
Sweetly , sweetly blew the breeze --
And either place the founder 's name retains .
To the churchyard to take a walk ;
Plying the varied woof in sullen sadness ,
With outspread wing the eagle sweeps ,
Winter torrents rush from the cliffs , --
But lo ! there surges forth a shriek
Expressing joy in beauty 's hymn .
Aye true unto the trysts we set ,
And stronger than all storms that range for prey .
And sometimes many tears are shed
Yet on and on old morgan led .
A puppet for hid strings that twitch and play .
I , to confirm the mutual joys we shared ,
For which _ religion _ first came down ,
Attended that night , seeking surcease from toil .
But went on laughing , as before ,
Mayest thou seize the moment that passes happily !
' bout this time of year it takes me --
With gifts that only give farewell ,
For there shall come a mightier blast ,
The field all iron cast a gleaming brown .
Till hell itself they reached at length .
While sweetly blending still are seen
And crept into life again .
Lost is my eden , closed its golden gate ;
To his mouth made lengthened journey ,
And so the roads they twist and squirm
And , oh the ripples that rolled in rhyme
That on her will their fates have hung ! --
Lone wandering , but not lost .
Wrathfully sways the billowing days to be .
While the heroes fell to weeping ,
Steeply the thickets to his floods decline .
Something to make the bondage strait
The cause is lodged in immortality .
Who made a name at younger years than he ;
For what concerns my knowledge god reveals . "
And half i felt as they were come
And the long line comes gleaming on .
Still my heart remain 'd awake forever ,
This ancient scripture text proclaim :
And ere the red moon strives from dingy clouds
Whereby the weak were strengthened and the strong
And the weak sought the aid of the strong .
And wives throw their good spouses wealth away ;
This night the bolt should give thee free admission ;
And mourning souls have found weak faith recreated ,
For whose defence they stand ;
Lo , here is made a hasty cry :
Did life renew , fresh strength impart .
And when the year to end had come
And made me muse , by contemplation led .
But now his radiant course is run ,
The shining clouds , and all thy splendors show
Flash their revelation on the soul .
If life fails , -- death join our hands .
Twas their ensign when they to battle went ,
Those yet fresh streames which crawled every where
Is gone to the war in flanders ;
Handed down from by-gone ages ,
Like ripened corn-sheaves gathered in ?
Three that would go into every conflict ,
Her letters breathe of hope and cheer ;
Of your sweet lips made fools of mine
In sleep the same is ever bound to rage .
Which shall in verse and noble story live . "
Light flowing , from whose amber-seeming waves
And led by silence more majestical
A way the margins make that are not burning ,
Thus scotlands greatest poets met ,
Ruler o'er the dead , they made him ,
A long thin rapier flashed in archer 's hand .
O weary hour ! o aching days that passed
If bold larry took the lead .
Would break the silence of this dell :
Fickle summer 's fled away ,
The years that whitened o'er thy head have taken
Of gems that in their bright shades play .
Graced the occasion , and it was believed
In these pure symbols do i see ,
And the rivers lie in the sun 's bright rays
And bosom carved to kiss .
Roads stretch like arms across the world outside ,
With perfect patience . empires rose and fell ,
Shall quench the roman pharos lest northern pirates free
Within them was the twofold monster shining ,
Yet of the love we bore those dreams
He saw the laws that ruled the tournament
Thou join ' st the woman to the man ;
A sculptured vine that clasps the air , --
Alternately their shifting hands they plied .
Find shelter from the tempest . tell me rather
Where german faith is lost !
All day maintains the combat with the foe ,
Thou a kindly hand didst reach us ,
Stagnate sap of life and sense .
God 's countenance scatters the gloom ;
And gilded beams and rafters down they throw ,
Till there came a time in the law of life
And up the painful pathway leads ,
Weakness and folly show confessed
Around its root the branches lie .
While my ship comes with spices and gold .
Or the papers call it a war ,
When wild the flood provokes the quiet current
The tender light that on the meadows lay ,
Wearing the lovely light it wore :
For fleeting spirits it can hold alone .
Was planted for a doom divine ;
Only three things leave behind thee :
One part thereof left still unfinished ,
Lay the beauty they yet may see .
It rose , the bracelet white , with awe .
Till stars are shaken from their seats , like fruit
Anchors dragged through faithless sand ;
I made a truce last night with sorrow ,
The air was still , the water ran ,
And our hearts feel they must not break .
The youth who goes seeking for pleasure ,
While rays of genius only served to show
And valleys wrapped in snow ,
And the rose which unborn concealed yet lies ,
With your dear love to warm my heart ,
His hoof kicked up the clothing for such charms .
A freshening breeze the magic power supplied ,
Of reason , yet prepares that after joy
But word was given , and the trumpet sounded :
" you are a beauty bred and born ,
Pressing hot thy hands in mine ,
That touched the shafts of wavering fire
But the whole the heavenly laws obeyed ,
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood ,
The wind that swings roses !
It whispered to the fields of corn ,
Set all the camp on uproar and at strife .
Perhaps , by its own ruins saved from flame ,
To pass what time remained to him below :
And crooked shape of terror crouched ,
Which the summer 's breath enweaves ,
Whoever could this fight describe ? rollánd
Conquer your world , and find the eternal goal .
And read your inmost feelings ;
Might tempt , should heaven see meet ,
Above their graves be shed .
Too clearly do these pages show it , --
To find an ambiguity .
They make laments upon the wondrous trees .
When fort sumter fell and the war came
Such grief as never man on earth hath borne .
Now if she 's lost my heart must break --
Shall make thy limbs with beauty shine ,
Too oft entranced religion lies !
And spanish ale shall give you hope ,
How the first female , as the scriptures show ,
The tearless sobs tore at my heart .
These haunts of sorrow , shall sink to rest .
And gave cold kisses with her horny bill .
Around him anguish speaks in languid tones ,
" love hath made this thing a man . "
Through foreign lands will ride . ”
Trying to hold the line ,
Whereas the mercy-wanting winds had torne
In their conjunction met , give me to spell ,
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . "
Throughout that woven music of the days
There must rest the good and evil . "
She can not see the life she gave .
So nights and days he passes : such delight
His leisure told him that his time was come .
So saying , to his assembly back he drew :
Round the buzzing rascals go .
Before me like a mist that streamed and fell
My conscience says , sir , take his word .
" thy questions all true answers shall receive ;
A spring then backwards took :
With joy that knows no name .
And iron bowels stuff the dark abode .
When our two hearts lie cold beneath the rose ?
Wherein she suffering , all her spirits languish ,
With eyelids twitching to tears and with eyes grown tender
My spirit while the vision seems to stay ;
To such harmonious efforts float .
Might raise musaeus from his bower ,
Each , for madness ruled the hour ,
The world shall find this miracle in me ,
Or sin provoke from fate , than this .
What love sees true is true indeed !
Of shining music , luminous and grave ,
And o'er my senses crept a sleep profound ;
On waves that rose in threatening heap ,
Of raptured bosoms welded with a kiss !
So imperceptibly changeth the charm ,
Death , who dissevers all .
For their abiding-place be made ,
The night that covers and the lights that fade ,
Men , with years and memories piled
Against sound laws which keep you good and pure .
Here cruel charity no off ' ring makes ,
Who brings the light of knowledge down , and draws
Fast silent tears were flowing ,
That taketh sins away . their prelude still
Then he spoke the words which follow :
But read no meaning in the storied wall :
Comes like a new-born joy ,
The years shall come and pass , but we
Noble and fair reward this day shall bring ,
Some mournful talisman , whose touch recalls
That constance held affection to the veil ;
Where the brooding old ridge rises up to the breeze
And the night raven finds delight in thee .
And now the fatal news by fame is blown
Since the most charming sounds thy thought can wear ,
Or the sands of existence have run ,
Those gods of ours in cowardice are steeped ;
That inspires a feeling of awe and terror
But pallas now drew near . sublime , serene
But soon a western blast comes sweeping by --
Should scare away the elves that wait on love .
Dark curls with blooms that nodding caught
And breathe the space beyond the flaming wall :
This found i true by proof , hearing that spirit
The anguish plainly read .
While still they followed for a space
Where the surf beats white and high .
Then rose the vánar chiefs , and lent
There may the child , whose love lay deepest ,
Fair time , which dreams so gently steal away ;
They only swelled his rage and pain ,
To mount yon window , and alarm from thence
Forget he turned cheek to the coward blow ,
Amid thy blessed light could stand ,
Will make all the garden gay . . .
Of blind occasions , when the world has come
Her vital flame burn brightly , as of old
With southern throbs the sturdy saxon heart ,
And from its frame a soul dismiss 'd for spite
Him , dealing havoc in the ranks , elsewhere
I give the first watch of the night
The downy peach make court to thee ?
That scarce two servants could the weight sustain ;
And the inquirer found a third to be
Of all the nations joined the central strife ,
Who leaves that purpose unfulfilled .
And as it went my tortured soul
While his horrid mouth stood open ;
Love 's sum remains what it was before .
Her heart was troubled yet comforted ,
For beauty born of beauty -- that remains .
The many homes of men shine near and far ,
And make me rich in feeling i can give .
't is only daylight that makes sin ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Lightning on him that fixed thee there .
The neighbors smiled and kept the secret close ,
So truth and justice need not take offense .
That melt and blend to our enchanted eyes .
E'en as thyself our hearts make clean :
Uprises as the mothers meet their young ,
And fiercely mounts desire , life imposes
To cool the lips of lovers with wine ,
Golden wood lights glancing in his eyes ;
Each face when at the wicket snapped .
Nor needs long prayer to make the dame agree ,
They made to press that loveless marriage on ;
The deadly lance she brandished reached the sky .
Had eased themselves in melody and peace .
Such bitter wounds , which only heal
Cold clouds and louring dulled the air ;
In thine own bosom laid ,
No gentler friend this leopard dashed with fox .
Mighty converters torn from their axis ,
A faint cry seemeth to flash like lightning ;
Our winds the whisper of applause , that flies
A sun , whose beams shall shed
And all her magic to thy eyes is given ;
He the dust with sports doth meet ,
As loud she laughed when near they drew ,
When these all my thoughts would employ ;
Myrtles and bays around me spread ,
And in temper make them clatter .
That fair desire from which all came ;
His feet had pressed at opening day ,
Which up there cover the sky in soft silk .
Her wrath against me slept .
How do i find thou hast discharged the trust ?
As friend can keep for friend in this our life
Whereto she set her sign .
Withered by age , will shrink and die ! "
The voyage life is longest made at home .
And only makes th ' unhappy blest . "
The bets go as the verdicts go ,
Not drawn from heavenly sire , and from the breast
Of expectation linger as it flies ;
His curses will pluck lightning on our heads .
To vanquish hell as here he conquered death ?
What rests , but that the mortal sentence pass
While coiled the dragon closer to the tree ,
And to your little new-born body yearned ?
Cast the light floating veil of purple haze ,
The tear and smile , that once together rose ,
" now the time has come for eating ,
Be comforted ; thy grief shall pass away .
Who laid the basis of this empire sure
Which reaches to your knees and makes your bare
And from beneath the leaves that kept them dry
Deidameia poured forth sighs and tears .
Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs ,
Could i throw back the years ,
Camest here to give me torture .
Thou dost leave the solid earth ,
I ca n't find my way home . "
Pope 's couplet originally ran thus :
Composing songs for fools to get by heart ?
The lotos speaks of slumber :
So , when the storm the forests rends ,
They yield to pleasure , though they danger brave ,
Thin gilded clouds float lightly through the skies ,
The haze is swimming where the beeches stand ;
Thy rugged brow from cloudes set free ,
Are shaken with earth 's old and weary cry .
And held it joy , those joys to miss ,
Now i give thee rightful answer :
First of the train , the golden talents bore :
Lo , we hold our hearts wide ope !
Molded were cast in influence of the fiend
Against the truth that stands without the bar ,
My fancied good , and brought substantial ill !
And faults wert filled . "
And surly songs whistle around his chin :
That reeking weapon ever thirsts for more .
While hence the christians take such heart and pride ,
Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
Sorrow may strike at the brightest and best .
Which came from some far region of his heart ,
Wake ! for the hack can scatter into flight
Brings life to the heart it shines o'er ,
In all the piercing beauty of the world
Before his hosts his heaviest curses flew ,
They know all wonders , for they pass
For the sad fate will fall on thee
Beyond the fight , his flying coursers stood ,
From the loyal garland . a pleasant song revived .
Over its enemy the day , and made
The clock struck one ,
Young love his ware comes crying ;
And twice about his gasping throat they fold .
And the alders bring discomfort ,
The war is waging , slaughter raging ,
I will sleep until the winter 's gone ,
The ground that melancholy stripling eyed .
Seals of love , but sealed in vain .
Not much a tyrant thy free speech displays me .
And i felt as i " scoffed " that liquid
I watch thin bubbles veering brightly upward
The murder of your victims beats the door
That makes a whirling maze design ;
The morning came , but not the holy friar .
The scenes that came before our sight .
A world conditioned thus , or care for breath
In visions round the heavy brain of sleep .
I , wrapping round me your humanity ,
O make in me those civil wars to cease !
That never looks but grace to find ,
Of burning mind and passion pent
With breathless nostrils stretch 'd above the spring .
Wealth shook within his gilded home
Seed that 's sown upon the wanton wind
Fear once again the rising freshet ,
Were pure as she whose brow they fanned .
Hath shaken off those tangled oracles
By ceaseless winds , the waters bathe its feet .
The emperor in his hands the gospel took ,
Nor knew great hector how his legions yield ,
A passion that no words can reach ;
Ere it be dashed and spilled , all radiance flung
Gives him every needed comfort ,
And my sorrow may not crush me ,
Just on the farther bound of sense ,
That gives us a positive pain :
Not all the iron yet has pierced my soul ;
Another aspect crichtoun showed ,
But i feel the farthest stars are all
But as the humble tenant , that does bring
All saints to give him sight of madeline ,
Which came quickly driving up there .
And rolling their dark volumes o'er the day
This gives the victim that before him lies
Whom physic , i find , always makes melancholy ,
In the days long since departed ,
Where the greenest mosses cling , --
In feature and in stature comes not nigh
The air is sweet where the pigeons build ,
Scatter the living coals of truth !
But public prayers imposed on heaven to give
Vengeance deserved thy malice shall repress .
While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke .
No revelation of bright hope was given :
At length the awful revelation came ,
And hengest who followed to help the defense .
Or he had found her gay .
She waited while the winter went ;
With beating heart ulysses spreads his sails ;
And the next least word true thomas made ,
" there comes no noise but weeping
And lay , drawn up to cool and timeless bliss
The wintry west extends his blast ,
" i gave thee the great gift of life ;
God sends me back my prayers , as a father
New interest draws , new principles control :
Is justice grown so strange a name ?
“ him will i force to own his boasted sire
Our party arose to continue their jaunting ,
Making the star seem silver streak 'd with gold .
Just a green leaf piercing up to the day ,
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
Where science in the arms of peace is laid ,
None heard the song till it had passed ;
And in words like these expressed him :
Thy mourning makes my sorrow sad :
But 't was this that brought me evil ,
The meaning of some words is made to vary .
Forced from your aid by cold december 's gale
My great travail so gladly spent ,
To see a better day . at eighty-four
The sad who find aught worth a sigh ,
And your heart skipped beats to say to you :
There is horrible convulsion , smothered din ,
Still thy distant shade was cast ;
He , still more aged , feels the shocks
And lust put violets on his shameless front ,
That his hand was stretched to seize him ,
A great hope from the gods comes down to me
He gathered himself , he leaped , he reached
Take the lusty look she weareth ,
And winter keeps cold watch upon the hill
Even where the fires of hate were burning ,
With knolls of pine , ran white ;
Who random drawings from your sheets shall take ,
Give the birches golden flowers ,
But nothing could her perish ’d sight restore :
Tread lightly where the dainty violets blew ,
But nature renders it imperfect ever ,
For which we poets still go sorrowing ;
That reaches to us here from overground ;
In worthiness were to that limbo gone .
Whereon no yoke hath mortal ever laid :
From the snows that the low stars have kissed
Will look to fortune 's smile to bless
To their challenge made no answer ,
As clouds with clouds embrace .
In light no darkness may depress .
He to the shades of solitude retired ,
Coming to my daughter 's marriage ,
And they feel how nature was fair .
Like gentle music gently timed ,
But give to me the snoring breeze
Exposed to the tempestuous seas ,
And struck my soul with shuddering ecstasy :
“ unalter 'd . soon the primal ages came
That is the joy and credit that remains .
And many a merry tale did tell .
And now the gathering darkness fell ;
Which sprinkles benediction through the dawn ;
And grew experienced by the deaths he made ;
Rejoicing to break from that dreamless repose ,
They only made an ugly face ,
Asking a truce wherein to burn the dead ;
At her approach the brazen hinges fly ;
Which gave the declaration , cried and laughed
His struggling breath will soon have fled .
While the beetle goes his round .
The wind blew high as they did walk ,
Till sleep fell heavy on the wearied lids
Of other arms , to make his dog obey .
Spoiled slowly , wasted by some bitter fire
Earth gives us thorns to tread ,
Laid to rest from toil forever ,
And yet my timid glance read plainly
Earth rocked and reeled from side to side
Thus went donna clara dreaming ,
As clearly shows by whom the knight was slain .
They pined away , i yet must live ,
O'er which oblivion , dare not pass .
With sad face set towards the year , that sees
And scarce its languid stream would turn the mill ,
This tells the world what voice will choke ,
The trees lash the sky with their leaves ,
All trust , a folly doomed to die ;
It chanced that brave idomeneus return 'd
They made yon preacher zealous for the truth ;
This night ; she fills the air with balm ;
A willowy brook that turns a mill ,
It adds to the sad place ,
With princely look amid the press he shined ,
That thy wind-spirit may rush in and shake
After her father had from life departed ,
To get the whole world out of bed
And the wind of the doors undone .
And those that heard him sickened where they lay .
May make a home of beauty there .
The burning badge his shoulder bore ,
We dropt with evening on a rustic town
His bullship simply answered " tush ! "
Small thought had he to mark the strife --
The monarch 's crown , to light the brows ?
Men draw sweet liquor ; here they dye their locks
Singing life will find him there ;
But coalmen do not run these risks ,
Should fickle fortune on us frown ,
Lies helpless by my shafts subdued .
While darkness came as it would strangle light
He sings , or leaves his song to seize
By the outward lives they led ,
In any place what made them creep !
If weeping eyes could wash away
The roofs made their crooked mouths grimace ,
That ran beneath that ladye 's bed ;
Because of a heaven to follow .
I make an end of tears .
Where fields are torn with sorrow ;
First came the lovely lion ,
To keep on honest if it pays or not .
A band of warriors sprung !
Split with red thunder-claps that rent and raked
Two lines added in later editions :
Then followed fun and skill and horsemanship ,
There lives and glows one verse in which there beats
Of my sorrow ; and i tread them
And shaped the soul that breathed below
Rising with outstretched limbs hath grandly spread .
The holy supper is kept indeed , 65 .
That taketh sins away . their prelude still
Up blazed the fire , and , dazzling clear ,
Let tears , and burning blushes speak the rest .
And mists that spread the flying shroud ;
Into our souls . all things are seen aright
That sorrow goes ! a month of tears
Oh , if we draw a circle premature ,
Advance , and both divisions come to blows .
One single taste thrilled to the finger-tips ?
With joy to feel how noontide flowed
I saw the huddled tenements arise .
The tide of adverse fate to bear .
The hard brands shiver on the steel ,
That leading cloud i follow 'd still ,
Shakes the sacred lodge with terror ,
Of the tempest of fate blowing wild ; --
Our life is short , and our days run
The sun rose in splendor one foine summer morning
The marks and characters , what could they mean ?
Which evermore makes all things new !
Honors which wear their glories for a day ,
The cry that owned thy dying thirst ,
Young fridthjof made reply .
This mount so fills me with delight ,
My city 's fit and noble name resumed ,
Shall join your happy babe to part no more .
Let courts untie them , and not armies cut .
From its tall trees , it breathes a slender smoke
You stand for to surrender up the keys
A car triumphal : on two wheels it came
To hold up right , and banish cruel wrong ,
Pondering things that lay beyond my ken ,
Thus in such ecstasy the hours pass quickly ,
And pass cold days in baths and houses hot .
The anglers ' lines the panting fishes drew .
Will catch most surely a fever .
Of joy , which its own hours annihilate ,
With borrowed blaze the midnight gloom ,
Where’er the torches ’ light was thrown .
As a country , tried by sorrow ,
A king might wish to hold in fee .
But sadder a sight you will rarely find ;
Questions the paths to which the king was led .
As if she 'd burst for joy --
The maiden laid with modest bearing :
Thus pressed , the queen began to tell
For whom high god wrought miracles .
And watched the waves leap roaring on the rocks ,
Where the rivulet swept by a sycamore root
His work was over , his reward was come ,
Dark falls the tear of him who mourneth
And builds a heaven in hell 's despair . "
Her life was patterned on his life .
Where darling peace with smiling aspect stood ,
The dust of half a century lies
That a blast of deliverance in the darkness rang ,
Pale roses touched with the spring ,
Now evening soft comes on ; and homeward now
The north wind is coming , i fear !
His bristling beard just rising in its might ,
Of roystering glory waited for them there ,
From rules of discipline released .
The cottonwoods make walls of shade ;
Can change thy bale to bliss . " --
Their conch-shells never blow .
Served the union in its struggle ,
Nor dare i tell the choice the mortal made .
Which to their corses came again ,
Then the second day advanced , light after darkness ;
The chief adopted by the martial maid !
Whose singing charms me while it slays .
( red rose leaves will never make wine . )
And wake a hope of god in heaven
While sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves ;
His forehead circled with a diadem ;
Love gives it energy , love gave it birth .
The choice we make , or justify it made ;
In low lament the answer died .
Dame virtue might her precepts teach .
Ambiguous bugles that blow and that falter to
Made his blood freeze with memories that lay
My cocoon tightens , colors tease ,
Further punishment is spared . '
He sucks intelligence in every clime ,
And no one sought their rest to trouble ;
And soon the steaming treasure sat
Soon as the water doth begin to run ,
Not a natural cry escaped her ,
The frost of selfish blood gives place
As stout suburban people lead .
To fill your mouth with love
The fire itself can put it out , and that
Has dulled our aching sense to joyous pride
As in a stick to feed the chimney rent ,
If this belief from heaven be sent ,
Along the skies their gloomy lines display ;
As in a prison kept her evermore .
She gave them a funeral supper that night ,
May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints .
That gathers on the pane in empty rooms .
Love in my heart was a fresh tide flowing
Of their turmoil wherever my footsteps are set ;
Proof certain that its entrance led to hell .
And the sun-rays , piercing through them ,
Yourselves linked sisterly , that sister-pair ,
The glass is turning with our future sands --
And their host took care they should richly fare
He hardly knew when waves he tossed on
We press to hear what sadly he relates :
The question comes -- what 's to be done ?
Devotion in his aspect was expressed ,
With arms that supplicate and trembling sighs .
This said , he sat ; and expectation held
And , sealing it , to mock our hope ,
Caesar drew out in colloquy the night
A sound like that sent down at night
Enough is given to fame . ascend thy car !
A husband she might get at last .
His words no faith could gain .
Ismenus first the racing pastime led ,
It makes no difference where it may be ,
In that new world , where generous hearts are found
But when no trickery found a path for flight ,
Should fell disease assail her now ,
Followed still the gloomy shadow --
Thence they were sprung , so numerous a tribe
To revisit the memories left in the place
Mercy was made for sinners -- be not sad .
Whose very voice gave sorrow mirth --
He with this feeling mingled with the bevy ,
Such icy kisses , anchorites that live
And choruses were given
Will gather the whole nation , recruit all creation ,
And armed to battle either champion went ,
Close grown with moss which the wind made barren ,
To meet him with all honour pressed .
Be patient ; put your heart to school ;
Who are those two that stand aloof ?
And unto each the promise came ,
Time hears its visions speak , -- and age sublime
Wall within wall to shut fear out .
Along the pebbled path . a queer thought came
To love ! -- for fiends of hate might see
And now his shadow reached her as she run ,
Shall the sails of my heart stand still ?
Thunders his ban from rome against all such
Stronger , stronger swelled the music
We hear their voices calling ,
Cling to the vesture of mortality ,
Only there sighed from the pine-tops
He might his kind civility repay .
They still have made me slight returns ,
Whose daring hand shall snatch the vivid light ,
The news that flies like fire from tongue to tongue
To find a friend who has these qualities ,
Towards the east he took his way .
A heavenly flower there fed with heavenly dew .
White clouds that turned to sails upon their way ,
Now pelias ' daughters faith unshaken give ;
The armies fade , the lustre dies .
As flakes of snow stood yesterday ,
A home for age shall find ,
On the atonement all his hopes were cast ,
He makes the percentage hard to conquer ;
Upon his looks sate news of loss and death :
The silver cord which binds the whole to heaven .
And blue , my dreams will stanch .
On his right cheek i put the family kiss ,
Answered in the words which follow :
Seeking happiness and love .
Should mingle with each altar that we raise
And follow death the way my fancies went
The editor came in whom i was seeking :
In supermortal might went forth to war ,
Ere his eyes have looked upon the spring
And tackers should come into play ,
From the isle of pain no breeze is sent .
My heart is crowded full of foolish thoughts
I pray thee take it not amiss ,
Her brows contracted in a frown .
Of colors that flash ere they fade and die ;
Which i before my answer made , supine
Is by the warfare surely worn away .
And first came parson rook ,
And echoing hills return the tender cry :
For to the time when life shall pass away
But power gave you pan , the ancient god !
Each christmas sees , before thy ancient shrine ,
Due attention he pays to the poor ,
Down his pale cheek the tear-drops run .
My soul , which might have seen , grew blind
Like that long twilight o'er the portals drawn ,
Perfume that leads me on from dream to dream --
Clean of the ashes that repentance sprinkled ,
The victor to the stream the carcase gave ,
Shall fall life 's shackles pitiless and grim --
And follow him , and be with him forever !
It is her peace that ye go to break --
And , though the year be on this wane ,
And hear a joyous laugh kindle the sky
Beneath their fruit , gave pleasant shade .
Where snow 's white pureness ever breaks ,
I wounded , and the lance sprang forth beyond .
He touches fondly where it lies .
Of waking life ; the streets were stirred
In terror stood up on his head .
To find repose ,
To which all other virtues yield and bow ?
The meanest charm thou find ' st in me ,
That cruel pride held gentle pity 's place ;
Through the mellow dusk thy proas glide ,
What mighty nuptials shook the world
To make me desolate ? whence came the strength ?
A staff eumaeus gave . along the way
Among them , made the dreaded foe his guest .
To bring his hen to life again !
The crickets , sliding through the grass ,
By which he had a fortune made :
“ nutrition craving , still the more it gains ;
Who were immortal , could one tell their story ?
Who hold as we this chartered sin abhorred ,
And all his blows were struck for love ,
Fresh october brings the pheasant ;
There came a shout that swelled into a roar .
So supper passed ; the meat in lion 's gorge
His druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat ,
Although such weather did not stop their growth .
Why , it fairly made me laugh ,
Exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold ;
Such dreams as brought poor souls mishap ,
In comes the playmate that never was seen .
Days without longing , nights no dream might move
When eternity affirms the conception of an hour .
In the great hour of destiny they stand ,
Staunch and steadfast i stand by my lord ,
And holy peace to all the world is given ;
All misery taught to bear --
Fair , by the flushed early morning embraced ,
They saw a spirit smiling to destroy .
She has turned from paths of sin ,
Surely winter 's gone away .
You hatched the scheme , you laid the plan ,
Untimely sorrow marked his thoughtful mien ;
That those waters should come to chagford ,
On the green grass . grief comes upon me
No hope were left me of escape from death .
The high gods , clothed and crowned with patience ,
Grim shapes could come confronting him .
Of music struck by skilled musicians
And passion for the beauty flown ,
That with thy glory comes to cheer
Seeks out the chords when he is sad
Whose sweets to her culture belong .
And often reaches , and his thrusts renews .
The scenes would flow like magic ;
With flickering strings which scatter melody ,
Of medicine the spirit 's caught with ease ,
Now swimming in the sentiment of joy ,
Though redemption was offered at infinite cost ;
Pulse with low whispers as they pass ,
I find it must be midnight .
A spark to make old memory reillume .
When the impregnate air retains the thread ,
Where once the peaceful tribes their votes declared .
Far as the hemisphere 's wide wings expand ,
A land-breeze shook the shrouds
That gives such perfect fulness .
“ its surface briskly by the breezes swept .
Right always comes to take the place of wrong ,
With added beauty smiling in the lines
And curse those councils which they praise ;
Yet witness those clear vows which lovers make ,
And driving sparkles dance along the sky .
And the same arm that led concludes the day ;
In each a common joy is seen .
On one side only take the fee ,
S was a sailor , and spent all he got
The sacred keys which open hell and heaven .
And taking root , grew bravely up
And back came labour , bondage , care .
Where exile turned to ancestor ,
" no farther seek his merits to disclose ,
" then he soaked his wings with honey ,
And waiting for the signal stood ,
And out of town and valley came a noise
And said , " i feel a little bored ;
The thoughts that arise in me .
And made me muse , by contemplation led .
And suffer , and regret , and build again .
Where affairs have for centuries gone the same way ;
Shall drive the spectres from unbidden ground :
The last full wherry takes the stream .
Who is the angel that cometh ?
The lark to other lands sings love and joy ,
While the days of life are flowing .
Whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart .
To the craftsman 's forge she wended :
Though there come a thousand heroes ,
In the bottom below a brook went by ,
But life gone breathless will she reinstate .
Rash heat perhaps a moment might control ,
And stretching far as the eye can reach ,
Better with breath than i did feel myself ,
To claim our friendship , and a home demand ,
Gnaws into self , now stricken with remorse
Can draw these scattered joints and parts of men
Of the kings the starlight guided from the far
My mother died : nights passed and mornings came ,
No time shall find me wanting to my truth .
That trembling hope forsakes it ,
Fear not these , they have made their bargain ,
Pity their weakness , and give them a tear .
Where each stood up , avenged his wrong ,
To my dear prison lead me home again ;
The civil citizens kneading up the honey ,
It roars like a flame that is fanned !
And love that sees the moon 's full orb
To strengthen peace and yet prepare for war ;
In which the water it was made of fails ,
The bloody armour , which his train received :
Has never made a friend in private life ,
Transcribe , set forth , compose , address ,
Thy sad eye rests upon thy faithful few ,
To guard all power inviolate from debate ,
He saw unnumbered trees unfold
King romance is come indeed !
Somewhat by fathering what fortune sends .
And make you realize yourself a part ,
Unto him who finds thee hateful ,
And tenderness sits looking toward the lands of death
How those delicious courts would ring
Brings thriving .
But leave them to the conscience of the nations .
Hath faded into nothingness , and made
The first with slow and stately step drew near ,
It fell on a day i was happy ,
And made a court that freemen never saw .
And fast they laid behind them leagues of sea .
A butterfly man , as you see .
When blows the wind and drives the sleet ,
And lost virginity of oratory ,
The wind might whistle , the wind might roar ,
One hand held fast the silken reins
The tares which in madness they sow ,
Clandestine , forcing me to yield the prize .
And wrap me in the grief of long ago .
The net of law is spread so wide ,
With light fear smiling at itself ;
Yet on her finger had she set the ring
A song of red reapers that bind and reap ,
With horrid uproar rend the trembling air .
The which do endlesse matrimony make ;
Here files of pins extend their shining rows ,
What i am and how it came ,
That cruel curse i can change and soften ,
Which the fates assigned me -- glory ,
At first retired , but soon set forth again
Tears rush 'd to burning eyes , and choked awhile
He held that churches should call two or more
Nor long will his love stay behind him .
And strangely altered reflects thy shape ;
And the heart turns to stone ,
Turns , and forth stretches eager for the food ,
Of which our old traditions tell .
Flung then the fierce one , filled with wrath ,
The gods command not where the heart speaks clear .
Four tapers flickered from each silver sconce .
To the low shores mine eyes i first directed ,
Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure .
She tired and met with death in bitter pain .
Swift instinct leaps ; slow reason feebly climbs .
For this in arms the warring nations stood ,
And winter was drawing near .
How much can come
They served the crown , upheld the laws ,
Bordered with trees whose gay leaves fly
Words fully flowing , yet of influence :
Like that the stars shed over fields of snow
And chills gave never a place ;
And on his front a snowy star he bore .
May pharaoh 's darkness , folds as dense as those
What went ye out to see
A thousand ships -- and lash itself to foam --
Too oft entranced religion lies !
My soul had charged with sorcery ;
For the summer grief had brought her ,
Drawing the gentile unto israel 's god ,
Move to swifter execution .
So there we stood and let the berries go ,
That marks the frontier line . '
His eyes with fire are flashing ; and his tusks
He called attention with his hand
The stars come out ; the fragrant shadows fall
A convent stood when arthur left the land .
The foe ’s left arm that held him broke ,
We recked not of wealth in stream or soil
The road stretched winding onward
Has flashed the dawn of freedom 's light .
" thus shines the star of woman 's love
You whose laws have hidden the one law ,
Whose folds bore the mystical motto :
Her breath , where true wit so gracefully flows ,
His regal manhood gone !
The last proud wish its agony to hide ,
Lest thy too hasty pen be led astray !
Which he believed , if it were pressed ,
Foretold so lately what would come to pass ,
With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire ;
The dexterous smith the tools already drew ;
Silence the leaves flicked softly ;
But hoarse and low and rapid rose and fell
Is read the grief she will not speak ,
While kingdoms rise or fall upon a shake !
In sweetest pearls ; and he did make reply :
They fled , their engines lost the pagans tore
The song broke , up we started , leant
What tongue that night of havoc can make known
Is pouring through space ,
Who would not take even the trouble to keep
The north wind came up yesternight
More grief it gives me and less of pain ;
As divers causes give to divers things
My window keeps for me
Washing the dishes fell to russian pete .
No other perilous shock gave surer proof
In which they see such admirable things ,
Streamed to the peak , and mingled with the haze
While tears blurred mine to see him .
Let me press my lip to thine !
Take heed lest his beams fall on you ,
Attracts them , follow ) , might ascend thus far
What secrets nature to the herd denied ,
That there the hope of israel trod ;
Runs the legend through the moss ;
Strephon 's kiss was lost in jest ,
Head-gear brings but pain and sorrow ,
( which make each gentle spirit bound to you )
As " blessings brighten when taking flight ; "
And broken strains only fall down
And i should turn to better ways than flirting .
Summer hath come , led on by sunny may
And cities that stir in a dream .
Shall comfort your declining years !
To pay his visits to my charms ! "
Farther than soul can reach .
To bursting with the clear-strained nectar sweet .
Of knowledge , what this vessel can contain ;
Too slowly young rogero plied his hands ;
To bend in fragrant tribute to her sway .
It sit wel to his regalie
And age shall give the tresses hoar ,
But some were sad , and felt no mirth ,
This is the hour of ghosts that rise ;
In psyche 's tortured heart began to move ,
Against the sinking sad tower-window light .
The unconquerable powers that can not lie .
The wind sings .
Safe be the highway where their feet may go ;
Found a home with friendly red men .
Can not give the name of gains
Give some work to me the wretched ! "
The morn may find the stiffened swain :
Swelling triumphantly , the glad cry comes :
In thy dear self i find --
When things occult display their power ,
Then the veil lifted from the trembling blue ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
And all the pavement streamed with massacre :
To bring all things unto a happy end .
My friends might take offence . my heart --
Fills their glad hours with tender friendship 's light
The fever held him -- the captain said ,
A deity rests to whom all men shall bow
Full in her face was shining the king .
Too soon her gentle soul returned to know
This evening from the sun 's decline arrived ,
She her throne makes reason climb ,
Lay struggling with her wild despair ,
To think that religion should make it her own .
Thine hour is come , and the tormentor stands
That most folks the real gems took them for .
O'er the wreaths of murmuring snow ,
And when i felt it was tired at last ,
And terror in her features shown ,
Let thoughts that change and fly ,
And the hoar-frost bring me sadness ,
Let your heart speak , minnehaha ! "
Then did my leader lay his grasp upon me ,
Crestfallen , and tired , and worn out .
Of two physicians could not stem the tide .
That hither came from her so distant shore .
I gave a curse to drown the sob ,
Because full well he knows his books must show ,
The old one stood in the dawn .
And to catch the nimble reindeer .
On banks of fog faint lines extend :
Her jealous husband an adultresse gave
Studded with pearls , when the tide goes out .
I felt my native strength at last decrease ;
That spring was just now flirting by
Come to pray -- and go to sleep !
Thy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover ;
Whose red tongues made the shadows dance like devils .
Now spread too wide a sail , forgive thy son
She shall run upon your errands ,
The servant 's cry would to heaven arise ,
Truths , which eternity lets fall on man
And , as the sun drew down to west ,
That round patroclus closing , hop 'd to bear ,
His working brain was never idle found .
His sobs speak fond remembrance , and he weeps
The light is gone and winona dies . "
Meantime all forward drew : me terror seiz 'd
Means that life 's best comes ever breasting
With acted fear , the villain thus pursued :
To ears with silence filled !
That gives the start , and hence throughout our limbs
The unthinking ploughman started and gave ear .
I 'll spare the burning of your cheek ,
Considering , i see too that they
That , dearest love , which fills thee now
" cease to weep , beloved ! " has gone
Triumph and joy filled indra ’s breast ,
To breathe the gale , to watch the wave ,
The chains lie silent on the footworn stones ;
Warm it shall keep my mother .
Where late had stood his palace fair .
Heaven-browed her eyes , whence sprang
As made the air one lovely lotus bed .
While freedom 's form lies crucified between --
And new zealand went mourning all the way .
Time was the cry went round the world :
Upon a north wind driving tattered papers ,
And when those clouds away are driven ,
In benediction his hands he spread :
Sounded aloud . the peal it blew had made
I was cast , the suit was lost ,
" when pain and anguish wring the brow ,
Ezekiel saw , when , by the vision led ,
But whether the angel death comes down ,
The christian faith there touched a heathen 's heart .
In modern eyes ) shall make the doctrine clear .
With anguish and sorrow my bosom did burn ,
And then comes slang , and cussing , too --
May heaven such blessings ever send !
Of cavernous hunger barbed with burning fate .
Love gives it energy , love gave it birth !
And now may peace be never broken
Be added too , they spend their futile years
He marks that this marriage makes sadder --
The ample wings he spreads for flight ;
Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came ,
The angels fell into a strife in heaven .
We are come to thirty-five ;
My brain perhaps would show
Where fierce revenge flashed wild and high ,
Of your horse i 'll take possession ;
And now it chanced that she had called her son
One thought alone consumed him -- beauty slept
Obscene to sight , the rueful racer lay ;
All the solemn spaces flung .
And see too well your crimes !
In years that bring the philosophic mind .
And his eyes fastened on the good green grass .
Are never paid , collectors always come .
And twenty hours have passed , light thou
Since on excalibur he took the vow .
From her lips breaketh .
Of orbs whose brightness makes her image bright ,
Nor failed those words her heart to reach .
The leaves that give it bitterness ,
We kept a silence honor could not keep .
With hopeless brows and tossing up of hands --
As might apply to a conservative !
Take a breath , and toss the ball
Yet surely there are men who have made their art
" open thy bosom to the truth that comes .
Holding them to their paths by that dark force
Till i those lovely graces see ,
Mourns less for what age takes away ,
The city which once made the long resistance ,
Has swept away my sin and woe ,
There i was caught up by wings of flame ,
To majesty tha welcome tidings brought ,
And bosom beating with a heart renew 'd .
I 'd take my pick and love anew .
Which called thee once to slumber . here the stars
Then first her anger , leaving pelleas , burned
Rending the silences with tear and scrat .
Had took a deadly aim :
We had loved , as the story says ,
To lean in joy upon our father 's knee ;
Shone still and clear the great compassionate stars .
And silence followed after .
Beneath the winding lightning , darkness came to birth ,
And on that sleep the striding titans broke ,
A little trade best fits a little toil :
And glorious images in heaven wrought ,
That followed the full moon 's great annual rite --
A faithful likeness of the forms he views ;
Thought he owned music 's purest note ,
Sweet mournful music filled with tears ,
Fear not , for i to victory will pursue ,
Talked of cutting off supplies --
They still to god their praise devote ,
But his mean labours wrought his present woe ,
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
Ere all the light that made it dear depart .
And , in himself collected , greatly dares :
When through the household flew the tale :
And how his madness went away ,
Beyond the fervor which the church inspired .
Have gone to their eternal rest .
O’er gem-like grass that flashed and glowed
They make a kiss to rhyme with bliss ,
Which , linking thee with all thy kind ,
Whose faith yet lasts among the menial crew ;
And keen were the winds that came to stir
With furious wrath his bosom swelled .
And winter frowned where spring had laughed before ,
That every hyacinth the garden wears
And grasses nodded and rushes swung --
To thee my heart is clinging .
I see it dash down the dark ravine ,
The peace that lay , the light that shone .
Follow rogero 's footsteps to the reign
' life is good , and joy runs high
God 's procreant waters flowing about your mind
Our cattle reel beneath the yoke they bear --
Its own affections gives ;
And it makes his heart rejoice .
The river that runs not far from lucca .
Large glasses , boys ! up goes the cork !
As the magnetic hardest iron draws .
Still from one sorrow to another thrown :
My heart grows numb , all hope takes flight ;
So forth issued the seasons of the year ;
And from the bronze west long retreat is blown ,
The sunshine falling on her golden hair ;
Wherein his lofty honours wide are blown .
Obviously , such an innovation could not pass without
With how strange force their cruel blows they drove ?
The silence speaks the secret of the world .
The arms of war will take the field ;
I feel as i did of old ,
I say but that this love of earth reveals
The bread which without industry they find .
All the wreathed movements danced she of that dance ;
Of fate which takes him unawares .
Just washed by gentle april rains ,
There let me try that piety to find ,
All too soon the gleam will go ;
Of his castle wall had tripped away ,
There comes no word to tell us
Of all white things dreamed and vowed .
A bitter cup each life must drain ,
The horrible dreams that come ,
Where lower down the stream o'er pebbles ran ,
Her arms around him threw .
Of passion find an utterance in thy lay ,
And he spoke the words which follow :
The wise sumantra , thus addressed ,
Its little life returned ; and then he gazed
Told all the tragedy that had come to him :
And malice held afar than near at hand .
When crowding stars come forth in all their light .
And the old faith lives again .
As many a year as it is passed and gone
With juno goes the hours
" meantime the work of pride went on ,
But rest came not ; when suddenly i heard ,
A holy presence hovers round her there ,
Heathen philosophers who went astray in seeking for the
I could have spared this fearful sight ! most strange
When ogier fell at last upon the foe ,
Down from her lashes the tears would creep ;
My breast with double grief have torn .
And well it suited with her fickle vein ,
And jenny kept her pure and just ,
Is love from a heart that loves liberty too .
He ended , and the herald bore his charge
As will not leave thee mourning here alone ,
Transfigured by the curse they cast , —
While op ' ning blooms diffuse their sweets around .
Nor private peace is seen to bleed ?
Which brought discredit on san luis rey ,
A sudden glory and around him shine ;
With douglas held communion kind ,
Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart ,
Is of a beautiful name made free .
Your eyes , divinely hurt with tenderness ;
And dying foes his power confess .
Till the tears fill both his eyes ! '
Waiting a wind to fill the stiffened sails ,
We pass by spaces that seem endless .
So i again resorted to the lore
Arrive in turn and mount the lea ,
To raise the crest she fanned .
The forest bends , tumultuous
I ca n't find my way home . "
By worrying lest it come .
From the mist comes a song , sweet wailing
The notes he pours irregular .
In that which should , his labor compensate .
The angels warbling their celestial psalms ,
To send ambassadors to spain , and lay
Which kindles war immortal . how it burns !
Making the cottage thro ' the silent hours
Give us a song !
It brings the tears into my aching eyes ,
Which she keeps for a sign
The air is stung with frosts ;
When wearied wretches sink to sleep ,
That lives decay as seasons smile .
The heart that her name will not move .
The tall trees stood as sentinels asleep ,
That made us creep thegither .
It will make my batter bitter .
Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes ,
The warning whispers pass .
Gets more enjoyment than the wealthy grouch ;
Given to senses , that thou must perceive
Still flashed unconquered pride , and sullen hate
When tempest begins its thunderbolts to forge .
Which heaven to gaudy day denies .
You have entered the heart in me !
That wraps the giant wrecks of old ?
Towers and battlements it sees
Her reaching hand caught the white flower surely .
And pace the floor that covers thee ,
Weeping for woe that left her not .
Giving their love as a blessed boon ,
Till other 's tongue reveal them . fervent love
The city ' of grief encompasses , which now
Our spirits rock together
No princely realm he holds in fee ,
With peace-white banners waving free ,
Should own a disposition kind .
Clouds and blown stars and broken light .
I feel thee bounding in my veins ,
Wild with its happiness , ran down her cheek
Of how his arts did over theirs prevail ,
While others feel thy sunshine now .
Let in thy voice a whisper often come ,
And yield due obedience ( when britain is gone )
Of sweet leaves playing with the subtle air
_ which never shall close again
The beaten flames gave way ,
To catch the day-break of thy dawn .
But juan also shared in her austerity ,
The face that a child would climb to kiss !
The simple life we share with weed and worm ,
The burden of the commonwealth , was laid ;
Next brave deipyrus in dust was laid :
Sink the still hours to eternity 's sleep .
They followed the lure of the far away ,
The gallant ranks he led .
To taste delights that artists have and bring .
Yet the world 's potter takes his masterpiece ,
In chast desires , on heavenly beauty bound .
Cauld blew the bitter-biting north
The houses , rearing themselves higher ,
And naught so reluctant but in it must go :
Across her face the darkening shadows fly
One scents the breath of jasmine flowers that twine
The garland green , that we have bound
So take it right or take it wrong ,
Our power is gone forever . we are nothing
Whence tyber first unlocks his mighty flood . "
Or seen his mother pierced with grief expire .
" my crimes lie heavy on my soul ;
Of eyes , which put out each surrounding gem ;
To bring us back assurance in that faith ,
The storm stood tall on the rose-trees :
Which in the final judgment thou shalt see . "
They to their honour in my praise combine . '
Night 's tender dews fall softly o'er
And fast the flames rolled on .
And day follows night
Summer is come at last !
Which thy shyness feels as such .
All trebled horrors that wise odin may
The bellows keep on croaking .
Sad thorn struck nightingales ' low dying song .
And led him where the shadows cast
My spirit , shaking off her earthly prison ,
Fled , while the robber swept his flock away ,
Man 's thirst of happiness declares it is ,
And , casting a disdainful eye ,
And fill 'd each pause the nightingale had made .
Whom standing for his country thou hast slain --
So bless 'd a life these thoughtless realms display ,
As his spirit took its flight .
Where flowers in sunlike glory throw
For great round organ tones that rise and fall ,
To know his face , that met me there ,
But by tender fancies brightened .
The realms where sorrow dare not come ,
Nor deem i any greek will find to blame
Thy halfness hot with his rebuke would swell ;
Where aye before god 's face his trumpets run ?
A row of trees runs towards the west ;
To break and be broken , god knows when ,
Under the sorrowful elms where they stand .
And anger flashed in his rolling eye ,
Nor leads the comet from its path awry ;
Until the cloven fire shall hither gain :
That lingers in the garden there .
Answered in the words that follow :
From all that makes my heart to bound ,
Midst which they found that they indeed must die ;
Where my world went green and fair ? '
Not a grief shall here remain ,
Full dowers thee , and royal bounty gives ,
And him reminded of the promise made ,
In ocean find a kindred spirit still .
Shall gore be made to flow ?
But my heart in me turns and moves ,
Once again feels hatem now
O'er my poor country stretch thy saving hand !
Had i pursued them with relentless hate !
And each went forth his several way ,
Drops follow drops , the clouds on clouds arise ,
It will last till men weary of pleasure
And life makes all things new .
They bound to holy vows of chastity !
No rushing glory , like a queen made bold ,
Break the spell which held her spirit .
When melancholy news from india came , --
A wind blew out of a cloud , chilling
I rede thee for thy life take heed ;
Ere their life 's morning hours are gone --
That 's turned by application to a libel .
By myriad furrows , tortures of slow time ,
And that thou put me not to further speech ,
Lured by a man 's desire ,
Come , fellow sinner , lend an ear ,
Remorse shall not consume my heart ,
Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground .
Whatever things hope promises to thee . "
And give the bard an honour 'd place
Of the brave hearts that nevermore shall beat ,
Then he fixed his eye on the shining track ,
And naught shall move my firm intent ,
For crime so deadly his life shall pay ;
't was pity nature brought ye forth ,
That acting it should make you to rejoice
Which from all cities bear away the crown ,
Each works its end to move or govern all :
Which he watched , and kept , and guarded ,
The chains themselves were enough to lead her
The walls are scaled ; the rolling flames arise ;
For the breath that goes as it comes ,
Which made me seek by supplicacion
It wants an hour still of day ;
Will force belief in these my words , and thou
My soul will thrill to hear the throbbing drum ,
It never went astray ;
A harmony that , finding vent ,
Pleasures come , if sorrows follow :
The heavenly portals , guarded by the hours ,
When creditors their bills do see ,
And dwindles away as silently as it came .
As thy love is discovered almighty , almighty be proved
As on the banner which stood near
But not of war it sings to-day .
And out of this surging and passionate breast
Her laugh has a sadness tears never reach .
The pythian tree the damning sentence took ,
To win and hold men 's hearts .
Has been changed to hatred wild .
The theologian made reply ,
By intellect and art i here have brought thee ;
And flew , to cull her rustic food ,
A light smile flickers on his face .
As the morning gave it birth ,
That many great exploits shall bring to fine . "
And tied across a rape ,
The rivulets run and the cataract drones :
Till my ego expanding encompassed sea and star ,
His feet extended quivering , beat the ground ;
And sadly fell our christmas-eve .
Then gray terrors came sweeping upon her ,
And toward the mountain slopes began to go ,
And ominous eyebeams threatened storm in prague .
She goes to sleep each afternoon :
Their relationship to show him .
And fought with rage incessant
But first take care of ralph ,
Making human audacity stumble and stammer
Like mystic shapes that eerily cling ,
To you that out of wisdom has come love ,
And lead them back to hope and peace again --
In his silly way and gives it a hug ,
After the fire a little more had roared
Frost kills the flowers that blossom out of season ;
Took the strokes of two , and gave .
The soster forto take hire brother ,
Still pass , and still i scatter flowers frail ,
Night 's curtain black upon the earth was spread ,
Sad is the wane of beauty to the fair ,
Round time 's dial thronged the hours ,
While morning returned at the trumpet
Did crafty horace his low numbers join ;
Sad pilgrims , torn by sad desires ,
The brow , the lip , the blushes shone ,
Thy peerless chivalry reveal ,
That happiness erects its throne :
Pricked onward , bound for their unsung romance .
Doth stand and smile upon thy mastery .
The hope of which makes hapless mortals glad ;
From their sad eyes who filled the road .
Through all the long green fields has spread ,
As the incense that rises from some sacred cup
Who with his fear is put beside his part ,
Nastiest ideas we are sure to find ,
Faith gives a grandeur to created things ,
Engine goes " whoosh ! " at the station ,
And think i gave you freedom as a gallant
To stem the sacred torrent .
With every sweetest turf shall bind ,
From some warm world his wavering soul had caught ;
' how holds in you such insolence abode ?
His terrors to cover ,
From coals that shot the flame to sky )
And true achates waited on his friend .
Space may produce new worlds ; whereof so rife
In whose veins the life-blood plays ,
Their sails were hoisted , and our fears release .
The breezes went steadily through the tall pines ,
For i wander lonely -- stranger bound .
And the tears come easily .
She listen 'd with a flitting blush ,
But it catches the sunshine and glitters still --
Fathom-wide his trousers measured ;
That will to sorrow move all minds forever --
Shall shed a peacefulness around ,
Till the wildest passions wane --
Where a mighty fight was raging ,
Legends of the days departed ,
Was bathed in tears and strained with agony .
Whose force no man can sway .
Which the dire fruits of crime succeed . ”
And birds that dart through air on rushing wings .
Each taking comfort . not a word was said .
If she kept that : she could endure to hear
Was not confined to feeling for her friend ,
As heaven had spent all perfumes there .
Where flowery turf lies green and soft ,
The lips of the shadow never stirred .
Secluded from europe , long centuries lay ,
Should fall on hearts of heavenly birth --
Unfathomed haunts that scyle each sun ,
So oft in childhood . still she kept her fair
Then shrieking , she arose , and shrieking fell ,
Of which my comedy cares not to sing ,
And , wheresoe'er he sets his white
Then fierce the stranger ’s answer came :
In the fine weather , which might make roads bare
The cunning artist would have wrought her fair ;
With aching hearts and scalding eyes shall come
Lay the proud usurpers low !
Into her heart all wrath cast back again ,
In paradise that beare delicious fruit
And then the pang of it will strike
Where shrewd wit is gone a stray
The new commandment given to men ,
If it is known a fellow can make skies ,
Anon the angry northwest winds arise ,
To hell goes first the instrument !
Its sorrow that they were shed .
Whose misty spray rose through the freshen 'd leaves
Thy heart forget the reverence it owes ,
The surgeons found , as dissolution border 'd ,
My restless discord loves no stops nor rests ;
When summer comes again , the turf will lie
In england 's ark assembled thus
Where roses sprang from every withered tree .
The young are stricken in their pride ,
Then let me hold the faith i held before .
For lethe is for no man set ,
Of life beyond there come to me
The charge the monarch gave , endeared
And thou , o moon , spread over savage night
And left no room for later passion anywhere .
In every eye a pious fervor flashed ;
To hit the sense of human sight .
But again came that noisy disturber of peace
The centre moved , a circle straight succeeds ,
A year has gone , as the tortoise goes ,
And a homesick feeling seized them all ;
Drawn by fierce fiends arose a magic car ,
I bore it on through the forest , on ;
Out of thy head i sprung . amazement seized
Or followed love 's despair .
The gift he took , no word replied .
Within the forum that all eyes may read .
From holding up the nothingness of life ?
The coils of death around thee lie :
With odds what war hath lost , and fully avenged
What part his enemies have played in this .
Now sublimest triumph swelling ,
Each billow roaring a shed tear .
The monarch spoke ; and straight a murmur rose ,
The promised had not come .
My wasted cat , in searching for a litter ,
A briton blunt , bred to plain mathematics ,
To sit seven hours on this cursed committee .
Got lots of satisfaction from it .
The summer joys the flocks to follow ;
That trapped her vainly loth . each hero led
Six years were run since first in martial guise
Who , wakened by the rushing midnight shower ,
That , seeing two who draw one breath together
Proclaim the three kings ' day is drawing near .
On the death she might not share .
Enriching others meets reward himself .
It chanced that adverse winds once drove his bark
Laughed as the scud swept by ;
With painted streaks , the mountains show
The ground pine curled its pretty wreath ,
Repulsive of his might the weapon stood :
Since naught from nothing can become , we see .
And has brought no news from dover ;
Round a great oak her arms she laid .
Of all thy bosom felt , thy reason knew ,
Then from the night there came a sound
He ceased : then rapture loosed each tongue :
These days whose poetry was lost in prose
I have found in one such worth ,
But grateful take the good i find ,
Take care you never hold a drinking-bout
' twere hard for modern song to tell .
And our sad spirits turn toward the dead ;
On my study shelves they stand ,
Broadened and leapt and spread as a wild white fire
That vie with daylight spent ; and vanquished night
To win that warm , wild love of thine ,
For woman ’s love in strife engaged ,
What virtues ye would yield for planted hate ,
Makes men forget their depth of misery .
Hinders the hinges and makes them wince !
Now happiest they that occupy the scenes
The schemes , pursued in vain for twenty years ,
And , caught up in the awful snows
O turn thee round , resolve the doubt ;
While yet the battle lay with god ,
Dark blood flowed in the fosse ,
Pensive he ponder 'd , linking guess with guess ,
Again the verse came , fluent as a rill
Discoveries made , but none could be aware
And gave salute as to a mightier lord ,
All the fragrance of summer when summer was gone .
While the hard pain dissolved in blessed tears .
Such spacious terms of edifice to bear .
Would shine , if love could make him great ,
This put the people to praying
Had set them for the prize of rivalry !
And , winter having come and gone ,
I once was pia . sienna gave me life ,
There arose from the depths of my spirit
Woes even passing his could i relate ,
Whereto you but address a third dimension ,
And the stately ships go on
But follow , follow round the world ,
With fruit and early flowers thy lap shall fill ,
Of finest fire , revolving me in scarlet , --
That made that fairest canopy .
Come , weak as is a breaking wave !
The eternal mountains beckon , and awakes
I am the word that lovers leave unsaid ,
" three times around it pass ,
Outlives my guilt , outlives my doom ,
Yet when to invade it a foreign fleet steered ,
Sat doubtful conquest hovering o’er the field ;
The fatal fleet to sparta paris bore :
The track called land .
The lovely , cultured landscape , waving grain ,
So through his river mine shall reach thy sea ,
Melt into the drawn darkness ,
Its height ascended , where two cressets hung
Earth drinks the fragrant flame , and i am left
It made me lonely and it made me sad
The eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn ,
Then will i count this loving toil well spent ;
While she stood cozy with her spark ,
Which should have filled the world with flame ?
And tried to make a landing on the main ;
To palen and to pine it made her .
Had i na found the slightest prayer
And bring their babes ; their hearts discern
And dips to bind his burning brow
Of mirth is turn 'd to sadness .
Weeping to him to lend himself to us .
And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell ;
Which gave this well to us , and drank thereof
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn 'd .
And each shall find his brother fair ,
